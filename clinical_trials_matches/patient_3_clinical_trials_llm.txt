1. A Study Comparing Treatment With Lutetium[177Lu] Oxodotreotide Injection to Octreotide LAR in Patients With GEP-NETs
   NCT ID: NCT05459844
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** [Exact match] The study specifically targets GEP-NETs (Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors). The patient has a NET of the duodenum (small intestine – part of the GEP), with confirmed metastasis. This is a direct and precise match. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** [Grade/stage/biology alignment] The patient’s tumor is G2, and the study stratifies by G1 or G2, making this a perfect match. The patient has metastatic disease (lymph node and liver), which is consistent ...
   Condition: Neuroendocrine Tumors
   Intervention: Lutetium[177Lu] Oxodotreotide Injection; Octreotide LAR

2. Open-Label Surufatinib in European Patients With NET
   NCT ID: NCT04579679
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** [Exact match] The study specifically includes a cohort (Cohort B) for NET of small bowel origin, which perfectly matches the patient’s diagnosis of a small bowel (ileum) NET. This is a precise match, avoiding broader categories like “all NETs”. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** [Grade/stage/biology alignment] The study targets low- to intermediate-grade (Grade 1 or Grade 2) well-differentiated NETs. The patient’s tumor was diagnosed as G2, fitting within the study’s inclusio...
   Condition: Neuroendocrine Tumours; Neuroendocrine Tumour of the Lung; Small Intestinal NET
   Intervention: Surufatinib
   Sponsor: Hutchmed
   Start Date: 2021-08-13

3. Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin)
   NCT ID: NCT01524783
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE3
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** [Exact match] The study specifically targets advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) of GI origin, which perfectly aligns with the patient’s diagnosis of a small bowel (Dünndarm) NET. The study inclusion criteria explicitly cover the patient’s primary tumor site. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** [Grade/stage/biology alignment] The patient has a G2 NET with metastatic disease (lymph nodes and liver). The study includes patients with advanced NETs, and doesn’t exclude G2 tumors....
   Condition: Advanced NET of GI Origin; Advanced NET of Lung Origin; Neuroendocrine Tumors
   Intervention: Everolimus; Placebo; Best suportive care (BSC)

4. Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in Patients With Grade 1 and Grade 2 Advanced GEP-NET
   NCT ID: NCT06784752
   Status: RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** Exact match. The study specifically targets Grade 1 and Grade 2 Advanced GEP-NETs. The patient has a Grade 2 NET of the small intestine (Dünndarm), which falls under GEP-NET. The presence of liver metastases confirms it's an advanced case. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** Perfect alignment. The patient’s tumor is Grade 2, matching the study criteria. The presence of lymph node and liver metastases indicates advanced/metastatic disease, aligning with the study’s inclusion cr...
   Condition: Somatostatin Receptor Positive (SSTR+); Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor (GEP-NET)
   Intervention: [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE; Octreotide LAR
