1. Everolimus After (Chemo)Embolization for Liver Metastases From Digestive Endocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01678664
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF: Everolimus After (Chemo)Embolization for Liver Metastases From Digestive Endocrine Tumors
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets digestive endocrine tumors (NETs), and the patient has a NET of the small intestine (Dünndarm), which falls under this category. The study focuses on liver metastases, which the patient demonstrably has.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient’s tumor is a G2 NET. While the study doesn’t explicitly state a grade restriction, G2 falls within a generally acceptable range for NET studies, and the focus is on metastatic disease rather than primary tumor grade. The patient has liver metastases, aligning directly with the study’s focus. The DOTATOC PET showing low somatostatin receptor expression isn’t directly addressed, but doesn’t disqualify the patient as Everolimus’ mechanism isn’t dependent on receptor status.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomie and ileum resection) and is now considering further systemic therapy (Everolimus or PRRT). The study investigates Everolimus after (chemo)embolization. [Explanation truncated for readability]

2. Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Combination With Lenalidomide
   NCT ID: NCT01218555
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly includes patients with neuroendocrine cancer, and specifically lists neuroendocrine cancer as part of the expansion cohort. The patient has a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the small intestine. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient’s tumor is G2, which is within the acceptable range for many NET studies, and this study doesn’t specify a grade restriction. The patient has metastatic disease (liver and lymph node), and the study accepts patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment, aligning with the metastatic stage. The DOTATOC PET showing low somatostatin receptor expression doesn't preclude participation. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently considering Everolimus versus PRRT, indicating a need for further therapy after initial surgery. The study description states it is for patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment or are unable to tolerate it, making it appropriate for this patient’s situation post-surgery and considering further systemic options. Prior hemicolektomy and ileum resection do not conflict with the study inclusion criteria.

   Condition: Solid Organ Malignancies; Adenoidcystic Carcinoma; Neuroendocrine Tumors
   Intervention: Lenalidomide; Everolimus

   URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01218555
   Summary: The purpose of this study is to study the combination of two anticancer drugs, everolimus (RAD001) and lenalidomide in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment or patients who are unable to tolerate the standard treatment for their cancer.

3. A Study of LY2584702 With Erlotinib or Everolimus in Participants With Solid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01115803
   Status: TERMINATED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study description specifically lists “advanced neuroendocrine tumors” as an eligible population in Arm B. The patient has a metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of the small intestine, fulfilling this criterion. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 NET with metastatic disease to lymph nodes and the liver. The study doesn’t specify grade restrictions, and the presence of metastatic disease is explicitly included in the study population ("advanced or metastatic"). The DOTATOC PET showing low somatostatin receptor expression isn't directly addressed, but doesn't disqualify the patient. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently considering Everolimus as a further therapy option. Arm B of the study specifically investigates LY2584702 + Everolimus in advanced NETs. The patient’s prior surgery (hemicolektomy and resection) does not conflict with study inclusion.

4. Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT00510068
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF: Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). While the study doesn’t specify the primary tumor site, studies of advanced NETs often include small bowel NETs, and this study is evaluating Everolimus in that context. This aligns with the patient’s diagnosis of a small intestinal NET.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient’s tumor is a G2 NET. Everolimus trials often include G1-G2 NETs. The patient has metastatic disease (lymph nodes and liver), indicating advanced disease, which is the target population for this study. The DOTATOC PET showing low somatostatin receptor expression doesn’t exclude the patient from an Everolimus trial, as Everolimus’ mechanism of action is independent of somatostatin receptor status.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomie and ileum resection). The question is whether to proceed with Everolimus or PRRT. [Explanation truncated for readability]

5. AMG 479 in Advanced Carcinoid and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01024387
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and includes a cohort specifically for “carcinoid tumors,” which encompasses small intestinal NETs like this patient’s. The study acknowledges the distinction between pancreatic and gastrointestinal NETs, demonstrating awareness of the relevant subtypes. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 small intestinal NET with regional lymph node and liver metastases. While the study doesn’t specify grade requirements, G2 falls within a clinically relevant and acceptable range for NET studies. The presence of metastatic disease is compatible with a study focused on advanced NETs. The DOTATOC PET showing low somatostatin receptor expression isn't directly addressed, but doesn't disqualify the patient. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently considering Everolimus or PRRT following surgical resection. This study evaluating AMG 479 would be a potential alternative or subsequent therapy option, fitting within the context of exploring further treatment strategies for advanced disease.
