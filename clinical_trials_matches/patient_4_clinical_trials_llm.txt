1. Everolimus After (Chemo)Embolization for Liver Metastases From Digestive Endocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01678664
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF: Everolimus After (Chemo)Embolization for Liver Metastases From Digestive Endocrine Tumors
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets digestive endocrine tumors (NETs), and the patient has a pancreatic NET. The study focuses on liver metastases, which the patient demonstrably has. This meets the mandatory criteria.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with liver metastases. While the study doesn’t explicitly state G2, it includes “digestive endocrine tumors” which encompasses a range of grades. The presence of liver metastases is a core inclusion criterion for this study. The patient’s disease extent (primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, liver metastases) is directly relevant. Functional status isn’t specified in the study description, and isn’t a disqualifier given the focus on liver metastases.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently on Somatuline and has progressed on this therapy (demonstrated by DOTATOC PET). The study investigates Everolimus after (chemo)embolization. The patient hasn’t had embolization yet, but this study could be considered after embolization is performed, making it a logical next step in treatment. [Explanation truncated for readability]

2. Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Combination With Lenalidomide
   NCT ID: NCT01218555
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly includes patients with neuroendocrine cancer, and specifically lists neuroendocrine cancer alongside adenoidcystic carcinoma and kidney cancer in the expansion cohort. The patient has a pancreatic NET, which falls under the umbrella of NETs. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 NET. While the study doesn’t explicitly state grade requirements, G2 is a common and acceptable grade for NET studies. The patient has metastatic disease (liver and lymph node), and the study targets patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment, which aligns with progressive metastatic disease. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently on Somatuline and has demonstrated progression on this therapy (as evidenced by the DOTATOC PET scan). This indicates a need for further therapy, making them a candidate for a study evaluating alternative treatments like Everolimus. The study description focuses on patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment, fitting the patient’s situation.

3. A Study of LY2584702 With Erlotinib or Everolimus in Participants With Solid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01115803
   Status: TERMINATED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study description explicitly includes “advanced neuroendocrine tumors” in Arm B, making it directly relevant to the patient’s diagnosis of a pancreatic NET with metastatic disease. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with liver metastases. While the study doesn’t specify grade, it doesn’t exclude G2 tumors either. The presence of metastatic disease aligns with the “advanced” criteria in the study description. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently on Somatuline and has progressed on it (demonstrated by DOTATOC PET). This suggests a need for further systemic therapy, making them a candidate for a study evaluating Everolimus (specifically mentioned in Arm B). The study allows for patients with advanced NETs, fitting the patient’s current situation. 
          4. Clinical Eligibility: Assuming the patient meets standard age, performance status, and organ function criteria (which are not provided but would need to be confirmed), there are no immediate red flags regarding basic eligibility. 
          5. Therapeutic Rationale: The patient’s question is whether to pursue Everolimus or PRRT. [Explanation truncated for readability]

4. Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT00510068
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF: Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). While the study doesn’t specifically list pancreatic NETs, it includes “advanced neuroendocrine tumors” which encompasses this diagnosis. This meets the mandatory criteria.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a Grade 2 pancreatic NET with lymph node and liver metastases. The study description doesn’t specify a grade restriction, only “advanced” NETs, which aligns with metastatic disease. The presence of liver metastases confirms advanced stage, compatible with the study population. Functional status isn’t specified in either the patient profile or study description, making this a neutral point.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently on Somatuline and has demonstrated progression on this therapy (confirmed by DOTATOC PET). The question being asked is whether to proceed with Everolimus or PRRT, indicating a need for second-line or later therapy. [Explanation truncated for readability]

5. AMG 479 in Advanced Carcinoid and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01024387
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which is the patient’s primary diagnosis. The study design includes a specific cohort for pancreatic NETs, demonstrating clear relevance. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET. The study doesn’t specify a grade restriction, making it compatible. The patient has metastatic disease (liver and potentially lymph node), which is consistent with an “advanced” tumor status as indicated in the study title. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently on Somatuline and is considering Everolimus or PRRT, indicating progression despite initial treatment. The study description doesn’t specify a line of therapy restriction, suggesting it’s suitable for patients with progressing disease. Prior Somatuline does not appear to be a disqualifying factor. 
          4. Clinical Eligibility: While age, performance status, and organ function are not provided, there’s no information to suggest the patient would not meet standard eligibility criteria. These would need to be confirmed during full screening. 
          5. Therapeutic Rationale: AMG 479 is a novel agent being investigated in NETs. [Explanation truncated for readability]

6. Testing Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine and Carcinoid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT03375320
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF CABOZANTINIB STUDY
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET), which directly matches the patient’s diagnosis of a pancreatic NET. The inclusion of “carcinoid tumors” alongside pancreatic NETs doesn’t detract from the relevance, as pancreatic NETs are often considered within the broader NET/carcinoid spectrum.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with lymph node and liver metastases. The study doesn’t specify a grade restriction, focusing on advanced disease, which the patient clearly has with metastatic spread. The presence of liver metastases aligns with the study’s inclusion criteria of progressed disease.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient started Somatuline in 2015 and has demonstrated progression on DOTATOC PET in 
          2016. This indicates disease progression after prior therapy (Somatuline), fulfilling a key inclusion criterion. The study is designed for patients whose disease has progressed after prior therapy. The question of Everolimus vs. PRRT suggests the patient is now considering second-line options, making this study appropriate.
