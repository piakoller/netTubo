3. A Study Comparing Treatment With Lutetium[177Lu] Oxodotreotide Injection to Octreotide LAR in Patients With GEP-NETs
   NCT ID: NCT05459844
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** [Exact match] The study specifically targets GEP-NETs (Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors). The patient has a pancreatic NET (NET des Pankreas), fulfilling the primary site requirement. This is a precise match, not a broad categorization. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** [Grade/stage/biology alignment] The patient’s tumor is G2. The study stratification *includes* G2 NETs. The patient has metastatic disease (lymph node and liver metastases), which aligns with the ...

   Phase: EARLY_PHASE1
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** [Exact match] The study specifically targets neuroendocrine neoplasia’s (NENs), with a focus on gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs). The patient has a pancreatic NET (NET des Pankreas), fulfilling the diagnostic criteria. The study’s focus on SST2 overexpression is relevant as Somatuline was initiated, indicating presumed SST2 positivity. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** [Grade/stage/biology alignment] The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with regional l...
