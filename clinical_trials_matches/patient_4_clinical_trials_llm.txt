1. Testing Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine and Carcinoid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT03375320
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, matching the patient’s diagnosis. The inclusion criteria allow for patients with progressed disease after prior therapy (somatuline in this case), and continuation of somatostatin analogs is permitted. The patient’s clinical question regarding Everolimus or PRRT makes cabozantinib a potentially useful alternative treatment option. Finally, the study has published results in a peer-reviewed journal, indicating good scientific quality.

2. Liposomal Irinotecan, Fluorouracil and Leucovorin in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced High Grade Neuroendocrine Cancer of Gastrointestinal, Unknown, or Pancreatic Origin
   NCT ID: NCT03736720
   Status: TERMINATED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, matching the patient's diagnosis. While the patient's ECOG and age are unknown, the inclusion criteria specify ECOG 0-2, and there are no age restrictions, so the patient may be eligible. The intervention (liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin) represents a potential alternative treatment option to Everolimus or PRRT, which is the clinical question being considered. The study has published results, indicating good scientific quality.

3. A Study of LEE011 With Everolimus in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT03070301
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes pancreatic NET patients (foregut origin) with characteristics similar to the patient’s G2 NET. While the patient’s ECOG and age are unknown, the study’s criteria of ECOG 0-1 are reasonable, and the patient’s prior Somatuline treatment doesn't appear to be exclusionary. The combination of LEE011 and Everolimus is a potential alternative to PRRT or further Everolimus monotherapy, addressing the clinical question. The study is completed, has published results, and is a Phase 2 trial, indicating a good level of scientific rigor.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Neuroendocrine Tumors

4. Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT00510068
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The patient has a pancreatic NET with metastases, which directly matches the study's inclusion criteria of advanced pancreatic NET. While the patient's ECOG and age are not specified, the study accepts ECOG 0-2 and patients ≥ 18 years. The study investigates Everolimus, one of the treatment options the clinician is considering. The study is a Phase 3 trial with published results in peer-reviewed journals, indicating good scientific quality and meaningful data regarding Everolimus' efficacy in this patient population.

5. Study Escalating Doses of PM01183 in Combination With Fixed Doxorubicin in Patients With Specific Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01970540
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study is clinically relevant for the patient. The inclusion criteria explicitly list 'Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors' which directly matches the patient's diagnosis of a pancreatic NET with liver metastases. While the patient's ECOG and age are not specified, the study allows for ECOG 0-1 (or 0-2 for certain cohorts) and an age range of 18-75, meaning the patient could be eligible. The combination of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin represents a potential alternative treatment option to consider alongside Everolimus or PRRT, especially given the progression on Somatuline. The study is a completed Phase 1 trial with published results, indicating a level of scientific rigor.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)

6. OPALINE : A Study Of Morbidity And Mortality At 2 Years
   NCT ID: NCT02264665
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: N/A
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes patients with unresectable or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, matching the patient’s diagnosis. The inclusion criteria allow for patients receiving everolimus as a treatment line, directly addressing the clinical question of whether everolimus is a suitable next step. While the patient’s prior therapies and ECOG status are unknown, the study doesn't exclude patients based on prior somatostatin analog treatment and allows for multiple lines of therapy. The study is completed, has published results, and a peer-reviewed publication, indicating good scientific quality.

7. A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas
   NCT ID: NCT02875223
   Status: TERMINATED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes grade 2 NETs, which matches the patient’s diagnosis of a G2 NET of the pancreas. The inclusion criteria of advanced/unresectable tumors aligns with the patient’s metastatic disease. While the patient’s ECOG status and age are unknown, the study requires ECOG 0-1, which is a reasonable assumption. The intervention, CC-90011, represents a novel therapy option to consider alongside Everolimus or PRRT. Finally, the study has published results in peer-reviewed journals, indicating good scientific quality.

8. Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Combination With Lenalidomide
   NCT ID: NCT01218555
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study is clinically relevant for the patient. The patient has a NET with liver metastases, and the study investigates everolimus, one of the treatment options the clinician is considering. The inclusion criteria allow for patients with advanced refractory solid malignancies, which fits the patient’s situation. While the patient's ECOG and age are unknown, the study accepts ECOG 0-2 and patients ≥ 18 years. The exclusion criteria regarding prior therapies (at least 4 weeks off treatment) and liver function (AST/ALT ≤ 2x ULN, or ≤ 5x ULN with liver mets) don't appear to immediately rule the patient out, assuming they meet these criteria. The study is a Phase 1 trial with published results, indicating a level of scientific rigor.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)

9. Temozolomide With or Without Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01824875
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study is clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly focuses on pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, matching the patient's diagnosis. While the patient's ECOG and age are unknown, the inclusion criteria require ECOG 0-1 and do not specify an age limit, and the patient's prior Somatuline treatment is permissible given the criteria. The intervention, temozolomide with or without capecitabine, represents a potential alternative treatment option to Everolimus or PRRT, addressing the clinical question. Finally, the study has published results in a peer-reviewed journal, indicating good scientific quality.
