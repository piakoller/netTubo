1. Everolimus After (Chemo)Embolization for Liver Metastases From Digestive Endocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01678664
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF: Everolimus After (Chemo)Embolization for Liver Metastases From Digestive Endocrine Tumors
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets digestive endocrine tumors (NETs) with liver metastases, directly matching the patient’s diagnosis of a small bowel NET with liver metastases. This fulfills the mandatory diagnostic criteria.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with a Ki67 of 48%. While the study doesn’t explicitly state a grade restriction, G3 NETs are frequently included in studies evaluating targeted therapies like everolimus, particularly those with significant metastatic burden. The presence of liver metastases aligns perfectly with the study’s focus.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomie and ileum resection) and is now seeking further therapy. The study investigates everolimus after (chemo)embolization, suggesting it’s intended for patients with unresectable or progressive disease following initial treatment – a scenario directly applicable to this patient. The patient’s prior surgery does not disqualify them.

2. Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Combination With Lenalidomide
   NCT ID: NCT01218555
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study description explicitly includes “neuroendocrine cancer” within the expansion cohort, directly addressing the patient’s diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor (NET). While the primary focus includes adenoidcystic carcinoma and kidney cancer, NETs are specifically listed, making this study diagnostically relevant. The patient’s small intestinal NET fits within the broader NET inclusion. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with a high Ki67 proliferation index (48%). While the study doesn’t explicitly state a grade restriction, G3 NETs are often considered for more aggressive treatment strategies, and the combination therapy being investigated could be appropriate. The patient has metastatic disease (lymph nodes and liver), which is a common scenario for patients enrolled in studies evaluating later-line therapies. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient underwent surgery (hemicolektomy and ileum resection) in 
          2015. The question is regarding further therapy. The study description targets patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment or are unable to tolerate it. [Explanation truncated for readability]

3. A Study of LY2584702 With Erlotinib or Everolimus in Participants With Solid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01115803
   Status: TERMINATED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF STUDY: A Study of LY2584702 With Erlotinib or Everolimus in Participants With Solid Tumors
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study description specifically lists “advanced neuroendocrine tumors” as an eligible population in Arm B. This directly addresses the patient’s diagnosis of a NET. While the initial description mentions “solid tumors,” the explicit inclusion of NETs makes it relevant. The patient’s small intestinal NET with metastatic disease falls within the scope of NETs considered in the study.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with Ki67 48%, indicating a high-grade, aggressive tumor. While the study doesn’t explicitly state a grade requirement, high-grade NETs are often included in studies evaluating novel therapies, particularly those targeting advanced/metastatic disease. The patient has metastatic disease to lymph nodes and the liver, fitting the “advanced” criteria.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomie and ileum resection) but is now asking about further therapy. This suggests the patient is post-surgery and potentially considering adjuvant or systemic therapy for metastatic disease. [Explanation truncated for readability]

4. RRx-001 in Lung Cancer, Ovarian Cancer and Neuroendocrine Tumors Prior to Re-administration of Platinum Based Doublet Regimens (QUADRUPLE THREAT)
   NCT ID: NCT02489903
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly includes “Neuroendocrine Tumors” as a cohort, fulfilling the mandatory requirement. While the primary tumor site isn’t specifically mentioned, the inclusion of all NETs within a cohort makes it relevant.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with Ki67 48%. While the study doesn’t explicitly state a grade requirement, G3 NETs are aggressive and often considered for more intensive therapies, aligning with the study’s intent to combine RRx-001 with platinum-based chemotherapy. The patient has metastatic disease (liver and potentially lymph node), which is a common scenario for patients considered for this type of treatment approach.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomie and ileum resection) but is now asking about further therapy. This suggests the patient is post-surgical and potentially considering adjuvant or systemic treatment. The study design, involving RRx-001 followed by platinum-based doublet therapy, is a reasonable approach for post-surgical, high-grade NETs. There's no information to suggest prior therapies that would exclude the patient.

5. Ziv-Aflibercept for Advanced Progressive Carcinoid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01782443
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets “carcinoid tumors,” which is a recognized term for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). While the study doesn’t specifically mention small intestinal NETs, it doesn’t exclude them either, making it potentially relevant. The patient’s diagnosis of a small intestinal NET with liver metastases falls within the broader scope of advanced carcinoid tumors. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with Ki67 48%, indicating a relatively aggressive tumor. The study description doesn’t specify a grade restriction, making it potentially suitable. The presence of liver metastases indicates advanced disease, which aligns with the study’s focus on “advanced progressive carcinoid tumors.” 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomie and ileum resection) but is now questioning further therapy. This suggests the patient is considering adjuvant or subsequent systemic therapy, which is a reasonable context for this study. The study doesn’t mention prior surgery as an exclusion criterion. The concurrent use of Octreotide LAR is permitted and even anticipated within the study protocol.

6. Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT00510068
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF: Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). While the study doesn't specify the primary tumor site, studies of advanced NETs often include small bowel NETs, and this study is no exception based on available information (often, these trials are site-agnostic for advanced disease). Therefore, it meets the diagnostic relevance criteria.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with a Ki67 of 48% and metastatic disease (lymph nodes and liver). While the study description doesn't explicitly state a grade inclusion criterion, G3 NETs with high Ki67 are frequently included in trials evaluating targeted therapies like everolimus, as they represent a more aggressive disease course. The presence of metastatic disease aligns with the "advanced" designation in the study title.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomie and ileum resection with lymphadenectomy) but is now asking about further therapy. [Explanation truncated for readability]

7. AMG 479 in Advanced Carcinoid and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01024387
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and includes a cohort specifically for “carcinoid tumors,” which encompasses small intestinal NETs like this patient’s. The study acknowledges the distinction between pancreatic and non-pancreatic NETs, making it directly relevant. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with Ki67 48%, indicating a relatively aggressive tumor. While the study doesn’t explicitly state a grade restriction, G3 NETs are frequently included in advanced NET trials, particularly those investigating novel therapies. The patient has metastatic disease (lymph nodes and liver), which is consistent with an “advanced” stage suitable for this study. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomy and ileum resection) but is now questioning further therapy. This suggests the patient is in the adjuvant setting or has progressed after surgery, making them eligible for a study evaluating systemic treatment options. The study description doesn’t mention specific prior therapy exclusions that would immediately disqualify the patient.

8. Testing Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine and Carcinoid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT03375320
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and includes “carcinoid tumors” which is a broader term encompassing many NETs. The patient has a NET. While the study specifically mentions pancreatic NETs, it also includes a cohort for “carcinoid tumors” generally, making it relevant to a small intestinal NET.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with a high Ki67 proliferation index (48%). While the study doesn’t explicitly state a grade requirement, G3 NETs are generally considered advanced and would likely be eligible. The patient has metastatic disease (lymph nodes and liver), which aligns with the study’s focus on advanced NETs.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient underwent surgery (hemicolektomy and ileum resection) in 
          2015. The study requires patients whose disease has progressed after prior therapy. The question posed is "Weitere Therapie?" (Further therapy?), indicating the patient is now considering systemic treatment options following surgery. This fits the study’s inclusion criteria of post-progression therapy.

9. Octreotide Acetate and Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b or Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced, High-Risk Neuroendocrine Tumor
   NCT ID: NCT00569127
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), specifically "poor prognosis carcinoid patients." While the term "carcinoid" is often used interchangeably with NET, the study’s focus on poor prognosis cases makes it relevant. The study doesn’t specify primary tumor site, making it inclusive of the patient’s small bowel NET.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with a Ki67 of 48%. This indicates a high-grade, rapidly proliferating tumor, fitting the description of a "poor prognosis" carcinoid targeted by the study. The patient has metastatic disease (lymph nodes and liver), aligning with the study’s inclusion of metastatic or locally advanced disease.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomie and ileum resection) but is now seeking further therapy. This study investigates treatment options after initial surgery, making it appropriate for the patient’s current situation. There's no mention of prior systemic therapies that would disqualify the patient.

   NCT ID: NCT00171873
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF STUDY: Antiproliferative Effect of Octreotide in Patients With Metastasized Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Midgut
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the midgut. The patient’s primary tumor is located in the ileum, which is a midgut location. This meets the diagnostic criteria.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G3 NET with Ki67 48% and metastatic disease (lymph nodes and liver). While the study description doesn’t explicitly state a grade requirement, G3 NETs are frequently included in studies evaluating therapies for metastatic disease, particularly somatostatin analogs like octreotide. The presence of metastases aligns with the study population ("Metastasized Neuroendocrine Tumors").
          3. Treatment Context: The patient has undergone surgical resection (hemicolektomie and ileum resection). The question is regarding further therapy. This study evaluating octreotide would be appropriate as an adjuvant or subsequent systemic therapy option following surgery, particularly given the metastatic disease.
