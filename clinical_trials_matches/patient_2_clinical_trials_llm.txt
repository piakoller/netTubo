1. Testing Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine and Carcinoid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT03375320
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes patients with neuroendocrine tumors, and the patient has a G3 NET of the small intestine with liver and lymph node metastases, fitting the inclusion criteria regarding tumor type and stage. While the patient's prior therapies and ECOG status are unknown, the inclusion criteria allow for patients who have progressed after one prior line of therapy, and do not explicitly exclude this patient based on the limited information available. Cabozantinib is a potentially useful treatment option for progressive NET, and the study has published results, indicating good scientific quality.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)

2. Liposomal Irinotecan, Fluorouracil and Leucovorin in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced High Grade Neuroendocrine Cancer of Gastrointestinal, Unknown, or Pancreatic Origin
   NCT ID: NCT03736720
   Status: TERMINATED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine carcinoma, which aligns with the patient’s diagnosis of a small intestinal NET. The patient’s Ki67 of 48% falls within the study’s high-grade NET definition (20-100%). While the patient’s ECOG, age, and prior therapies are unknown, the inclusion criteria are not immediately exclusionary based on the available information. The intervention (liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin) represents a potentially useful treatment option given the patient’s progressed disease and the need for further therapy. Finally, the study has published results, indicating good scientific quality.

3. Study Escalating Doses of PM01183 in Combination With Fixed Doxorubicin in Patients With Specific Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01970540
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The inclusion criteria explicitly list 'Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors', which directly matches the patient's diagnosis of a small intestinal NET with liver metastases. While the patient's ECOG and age are not specified, the study allows for ECOG 0-1 (or 0-2 for certain cohorts) and an age range of 18-75, so they may be eligible. The combination of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin could be a potential treatment option given the patient's question regarding further therapy, and the study has published results in a peer-reviewed journal, indicating good scientific quality.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Endometrial Adenocarcinomas; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Small-cell Lung Cancer With Less Than 2 Prior Cytotoxic-containing Lines of Therapy
   Intervention: lurbinectedin (PM01183); Doxorubicin

4. A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas
   NCT ID: NCT02875223
   Status: TERMINATED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes NET patients, specifically enriched for grade 2 NETs, and the patient has a G3 NET of the small intestine. While the patient's Ki67 is high (48%), suggesting a more aggressive tumor than grade 2, the study still includes patients with advanced/unresectable tumors. The inclusion criteria of ECOG 0-1 and absence of specific comorbidities don't immediately rule the patient out, although the patient's ECOG and age are currently unknown. CC-90011 represents a potentially useful novel therapy for relapsed/refractory disease, addressing the clinical question of further treatment options. Finally, the study has published results in peer-reviewed journals, indicating good scientific quality.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Neoplasms
   Intervention: CC-90011; Rifampicin; Itraconazole

5. Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT03034200
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes neuroendocrine tumors, and the patient has a G3 small intestinal NET with liver metastases. The inclusion criteria do not explicitly exclude the patient based on the provided information; there's no mention of age being under 14, and the patient likely has adequate organ function given prior surgery and no stated contraindications. ONC201 represents a potentially useful treatment option given the patient's question regarding further therapy after surgery, and the study has published results in peer-reviewed journals, indicating good scientific quality.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Recurrent Neuroendocrine Tumor; Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumor
   Intervention: ONC201
   Sponsor: Peter Anderson
   Start Date: 2017-08-02
   Completion Date: 2023-05-19
   Locations: Cleveland Clinic Pediatric and Taussig Cancer Institute, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, United States
   URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03034200
   Summary: The purpose of this study is to learn if a new drug, ONC201 can make tumors become smaller or go away completely. Investigators also want to learn if ONC201 can prevent new deposits of cancer from appearing in new places in participants (metastases). A phase 2 study of ONC201 in PC-PG (pheochromocyt...

6. Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic
   NCT ID: NCT02721732
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study is clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes 'other rare tumors' which could encompass a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the small intestine. The patient's history of surgery and presence of metastatic disease aligns with the study's focus on unresectable/metastatic tumors. While the patient's prior therapies and biomarkers are unknown, the inclusion criteria regarding performance status and lab values appear potentially meetable. The study has published results in peer-reviewed journals, indicating good scientific quality and potential benefit from pembrolizumab.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)

7. Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET
   NCT ID: NCT03972488
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The patient has a G3 NET of the small intestine with liver metastases, which falls under the GEP-NET category included in the study. The patient's Ki67 of 48% is within the inclusion range of ≥10 and ≤ 55%. While the patient's age, ECOG status, and prior therapies are not specified, the study doesn't explicitly exclude patients based on prior surgery (the patient had a hemicolektomy) and the clinical question is regarding further therapy, suggesting Lutathera could be a viable option. The study is a Phase 3 trial with published results, indicating good scientific quality.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Gastro-enteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor
   Intervention: Lutathera; 30 mg Octreotide long acting repeatable (LAR) (Sandostatin LAR Depot); 2.5% Lys-Arg sterile amino acid solution; High dose 60 mg octreotide long-acting repeatable
