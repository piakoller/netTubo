--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Combination With Lenalidomide
   NCT ID: NCT01218555
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study description explicitly includes “neuroendocrine cancer” within the expansion cohort, directly addressing the patient’s diagnosis of a pancreatic NET. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with evidence of regional lymph node and liver metastases. While the study doesn’t specify grade, the inclusion of NETs generally allows for a range of grades, and G2 is a common inclusion criterion in NET trials. The metastatic disease is compatible with the study’s focus on patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently considering further therapy options (Somatuline or PRRT), indicating a need for additional treatment beyond initial approaches. The study targets patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment or who are unable to tolerate it, aligning with this context. Prior DOTATOC PET suggests prior somatostatin analogue treatment is possible, but doesn’t automatically exclude the patient.

   Summary: The purpose of this study is to study the combination of two anticancer drugs, everolimus (RAD001) and lenalidomide in patients whose cancer is no longer responding to standard treatment or patients who are unable to tolerate the standard treatment for their cancer.

2. A Study of LY2584702 With Erlotinib or Everolimus in Participants With Solid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01115803
   Status: TERMINATED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study description specifically lists “advanced neuroendocrine tumors” as an eligible population in Arm B. This directly addresses the patient’s diagnosis of a pancreatic NET with metastatic disease. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with lymph node and liver metastases – representing advanced/metastatic disease. The study doesn’t specify grade restrictions within the NET population, making this a compatible match. The DOTATOC PET scan indicates somatostatin receptor positivity, which, while not directly addressed in the study description, doesn’t disqualify the patient. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently considering further therapy (Somatuline or PRRT), suggesting they haven’t yet exhausted standard treatment options. The study allows for patients with advanced NETs, fitting this context. Prior therapies aren’t explicitly mentioned as exclusionary in the provided description.

3. Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT00510068
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   EVALUATION OF: Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors
          1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). While the study doesn’t specify pancreatic NETs, it includes “advanced neuroendocrine tumors” generally, making it relevant to this patient’s diagnosis of a pancreatic NET with metastases.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with lymph node and liver metastases. Advanced NETs are the target population for this study. The grade (G2) is directly applicable. The presence of metastases indicates advanced disease, aligning with the study’s inclusion criteria. The DOTATOC PET showing strong somatostatin receptor expression doesn’t exclude the patient, and may even be relevant as a potential biomarker for response (though not a direct inclusion criterion).
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently considering further therapy – Somatuline or PRRT. This suggests they haven’t yet exhausted standard treatment options. Everolimus is often considered after or alongside somatostatin analogs, making this a potentially appropriate next step. [Explanation truncated for readability]

4. AMG 479 in Advanced Carcinoid and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01024387
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which is the patient’s primary diagnosis. The study design includes a specific cohort for pancreatic NETs, demonstrating clear relevance. 
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET. The study doesn’t specify a grade restriction, therefore G2 is acceptable. The patient has metastatic disease (lymph nodes and liver), which is consistent with an “advanced” tumor status as indicated in the study description. The DOTATOC PET scan indicates somatostatin receptor positivity, which, while not directly addressed in the study description, doesn’t preclude participation. 
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is seeking further therapy options (Somatuline or PRRT), suggesting they have likely progressed or are considering alternatives to current standard of care. The study description doesn’t specify a line of therapy restriction, making it potentially suitable for a patient exploring further treatment options. Prior therapies aren’t mentioned as exclusionary criteria in the provided description.

5. Testing Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine and Carcinoid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT03375320
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which is the patient’s primary diagnosis. The study also includes carcinoid tumors, but the primary focus on pancreatic NETs is directly relevant.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with lymph node and liver metastases. The study specifically includes advanced pancreatic NETs, and does not specify a grade restriction, making a G2 tumor eligible. The presence of metastases indicates advanced disease, aligning with the study population. The DOTATOC PET scan indicates somatostatin receptor positivity, which while not directly addressed in the study, doesn’t disqualify the patient.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is seeking further therapy options after initial diagnosis in 
          2015. The study requires patients whose disease has progressed after prior therapy. While the specifics of prior therapy aren't detailed, the question of "Somatuline or PRRT?" suggests the patient has likely already received some form of treatment, making them potentially eligible for a second-line therapy like cabozantinib.

6. Octreotide Acetate and Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2b or Bevacizumab in Treating Patients With Metastatic or Locally Advanced, High-Risk Neuroendocrine Tumor
   NCT ID: NCT00569127
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   1. Diagnostic Relevance: The study explicitly targets neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), specifically "poor prognosis carcinoid patients." While the patient has a pancreatic NET, the study doesn't exclude pancreatic primaries. The strong somatostatin receptor expression (DOTATOC PET) suggests a well-differentiated NET, aligning with the typical patient population studied in carcinoid trials.
          2. 
          Tumor Characteristics: The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with lymph node and liver metastases. The study focuses on "poor prognosis" NETs, which metastatic disease clearly falls into. G2 is a compatible grade. The study doesn't specify functional status, so this isn't a disqualifier.
          3. Treatment Context: The patient is currently considering Somatuline or PRRT, indicating they haven't yet had definitive systemic therapy beyond potential initial stabilization. This study compares octreotide (a somatostatin analog like Somatuline) with either interferon or bevacizumab. Therefore, it represents a relevant next-line treatment option instead of PRRT, addressing the clinical question of which systemic therapy to pursue. Prior therapies aren't mentioned as disqualifying in the description.
