1. PDR001 Plus LAG525 for Patients With Advanced Solid and Hematologic Malignancies
   NCT ID: NCT03365791
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** [Exact match] The study specifically includes a cohort for "Advanced well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors." The patient has a pancreatic NET (NET des Pankreas) with metastases, fitting within this cohort. This is a precise match, not a broad "NET" inclusion. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** [Grade/stage/biology alignment] The patient has a G2 NET with lymph node and liver metastases. The study description doesn't specify grade requirements within the NET cohort, only "...
   Condition: Small Cell Lung Cancer; Gastric Adenocarcinoma; Esophageal Adenocarcinoma; Castration Resistant Prostate Adenocarcinoma; Soft Tissue Sarcoma; Ovarian Adenocarcinoma; Advanced Well-differentiated Neuroendocrine Tumors; Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma
   Intervention: PDR001; LAG525
   Sponsor: Novartis Pharmaceuticals
   Start Date: 2018-01-24
   Completion Date: 2020-09-17
   Locations: California Pacific Medical Center Drug Shipment (2), San Francisco, United States; Hematology Oncology Associates of the Treasure Coast, Port Saint Lucie, United States; University Cancer and Blood Center, LLC, Athens, United States
   URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03365791
   Summary: The purpose of this signal seeking study is to determine whether treatment with PDR001 and LAG525 demonstrates sufficient efficacy in advanced malignancies to warrant further study.

2. A Study Comparing Treatment With Lutetium[177Lu] Oxodotreotide Injection to Octreotide LAR in Patients With GEP-NETs
   NCT ID: NCT05459844
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** [Exact match] The study specifically targets GEP-NETs, and the patient has a pancreatic NET (a GEP-NET). The description explicitly mentions pancreatic primary site as a stratification factor. This is a perfect diagnostic match. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** [Grade/stage/biology alignment] The patient has a G2 NET, and the study stratifies by G1 or G2. The patient has metastatic disease (lymph node and liver metastases), which aligns with the study population seeking fur...
   Condition: Neuroendocrine Tumors
   Intervention: Lutetium[177Lu] Oxodotreotide Injection; Octreotide LAR
   Sponsor: Sinotau Pharmaceutical Group
   Start Date: 2022-08-31
   Completion Date: 2028-12
   Locations: Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China; The First Afilliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, China; The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China
   URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05459844
   Summary: This was a multicenter, stratified, open, randomized, comparator-controlled, parallel-group phase III study comparing treatment with Lutetium\[177Lu\] Oxodotreotide Injection to high dose (60 mg) Octreotide LAR in patients with unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated (G1 and G2)...

3. Combined Beta- Plus Auger Electron Therapy Using a Novel Somatostatin Receptor Subtype 2 Antagonist Labelled With Terbium-161 (161Tb-DOTA-LM3)
   NCT ID: NCT05359146
   Status: RECRUITING
   Phase: EARLY_PHASE1
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** [Exact match] The study specifically targets neuroendocrine neoplasia’s (NENs), with a focus on gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs). The patient has a pancreatic NET (NET des Pankreas), fulfilling the diagnostic criteria. The mention of intestinal and lung NETs doesn’t disqualify the patient as it’s a broader inclusion within NENs. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** [Grade/stage/biology alignment] The patient has a G2 NET with regional lymph node and live...
   Condition: Neuroendocrine Neoplasia's (NENs); Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumour (GEP-NET)
   Intervention: 161Tb-DOTA-LM3; 177Lu-DOTATOC
   Sponsor: University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland
   Start Date: 2023-03-28
   Completion Date: 2025-12
   Locations: Division of Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland
   URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05359146
   Summary: The goal of this phase 0 proof-of concept study is to measure the therapeutic index (tumour to dose-limiting-organ dose ratios) of 161Tb-DOTA-LM3 in comparison to the current standard 177Lu-DOTATOC in the same gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumour (GEP-NET) patients in a randomized, cross-ove...

4. Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in Patients With Grade 1 and Grade 2 Advanced GEP-NET
   NCT ID: NCT06784752
   Status: RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Perfect Match: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Relevance Reason: 1. **Diagnostic Match:** Exact match. The study specifically targets Grade 1 and Grade 2 Advanced GEP-NETs. The patient has a Grade 2 NET of the pancreas (a GEP-NET), with documented metastatic disease. This aligns perfectly. 2. **Tumor Characteristics:** Perfect alignment. The patient’s tumor is Grade 2 and has metastasized to lymph nodes and the liver – fitting the “Advanced” criteria of the study. No Ki-67 information is provided, but it’s not a requirement for inclusion. 3. **Treatment Histo...
   Condition: Somatostatin Receptor Positive (SSTR+); Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor (GEP-NET)
