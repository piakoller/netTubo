      "abstract": "Delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) is highly expressed in solid tumors, including neuroendocrine carcinomas/neuroendocrine tumors (NEC/NET). Rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) is a DLL3-targeting antibody-drug conjugate. Patients with NECs and other advanced DLL3-expressing tumors were enrolled in this phase I/II study (NCT02709889). The primary endpoint was safety. Two hundred patients were enrolled: 101 with NEC/NET (large-cell NEC, gastroenteropancreatic NEC, neuroendocrine prostate cancer, and other NEC/NET) and 99 with other solid tumors (melanoma, medullary thyroid cancer [MTC], glioblastoma, and other). The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was 0.3&#x2009;mg/kg every 6 weeks (q6w) for two cycles. At the RP2D, grade 3/4 adverse events included anemia (17%), thrombocytopenia (15%), and elevated aspartate aminotransferase (8%). Responses were confirmed in 15/145 patients (10%) treated at 0.3&#x2009;mg/kg, including 9/69 patients (13%) with NEC/NET. Rova-T at 0.3&#x2009;mg/kg q6w had manageable toxicity, with antitumor activity observed in patients with NEC/NET, melanoma, MTC, and glioblastoma.&#xa9; 2021. The Author(s).",
