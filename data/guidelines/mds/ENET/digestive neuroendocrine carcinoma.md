Abstract
This ENETS guidance paper, developed by a multidisciplinary working group, provides
up-to-date and practical advice on the diagnosis and management of digestive neuro-
endocrine carcinoma, based on recent developments and study results. These recom-
mendations aim to pave the road for more standardized care for our patients
resulting in improved outcomes. Prognosis is generally poor for digestive NEC, most
are advanced at diagnosis and median survival in metastatic disease is 11–12
months. Surgery can be of benefit for localized disease after extensive preoperative
imaging. Carboplatin in combination with etoposide is recommended as first-line
treatment for metastatic disease. Irinotecan with fluoropyrimidines has the best
evidence as second-line treatment. Immunotherapy plays a minor role in biomarker-
unselected patients. Molecular profiling if available is encouraged to identify new
targets. More prospective clinical trials are highly needed to fulfil the unmet needs
in this field, especially on new predictive and prognostic biomarkers and to improve
survival of patients with advanced disease.

INTRODUCTION
This ENETS guidance paper aims to answer 10 major questions on
clinical, pathological as well as molecular diagnostics, prognostic
factors and management of digestive neuroendocrine carcinoma
(NEC) (Table 1). Data were identified by MEDLINE database
searches and expert opinion/recommendations given according to
the best available evidence and author's experiences. Each recom-
mendation for treatment and diagnosis will have a level of evi-
dence and grade of recommendation as per the GRADE system1
(Table S1). In the paper, the term localized disease is used for the
combined group of stage I–III cases. High-grade neuroendocrine
tumors (NET G3) have a different prognosis, treatment, genetics
and outcome compared to NEC, and will not be covered in this
guidance paper. Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neo-
plasms (MiNEN), which is an entity of controversy, will be covered
in Q10.

GENERAL BACKGROUND
2.1
|
Epidemiology
Digestive NEC is a rare entity with an aggressive natural history,
frequently characterized by early, extensive metastatic disease.2
The annual incidence of digestive NEC is 0.5–0.8/100,000.2–4
Large-cell digestive NEC is twice as common as small-cell digestive
NEC (0.36 vs. 0.18/100,000).4 Among 162,000 NEC cases during
1973–2012, digestive NEC were the most frequent extra-pulmonary
site (37%). Colorectal primaries accounted for 41% of digestive NEC,
while upper gastrointestinal and pancreatic origins accounted for
23% and 20%, respectively.2 Small-cell NEC are more commonly
encountered in esophageal, gall bladder and anal NEC. Risk factors
for digestive NEC are not well elucidated. Presenting symptoms
depend on the primary site, and in metastatic disease usually with
generalized systemic symptoms. Digestive NEC are almost always
non-functioning.
2.2

Digestive NEC vs. small-cell lung cancer
Traditionally, extra-pulmonary NEC have been considered to be simi-
lar to small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, there are major differ-
ences such as their pathological definitions that include expression of
neuroendocrine markers and a much higher incidence compared to
digestive
NEC.
Furthermore,
unlike
digestive
NEC,
SCLC
is
strongly associated with smoking, frequent brain metastases and
higher response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy.5,6 Diges-
tive NEC differ genetically from SCLC7,8 and from head/neck and
cervical NEC.9,10 Due to their differences, one should therefore be
careful in extrapolating data from SCLC and extra-pulmonary NEC
to digestive NEC. In this paper, data are focused specifically on
digestive NEC.
2.3

Prognosis and survival
Patients with localized digestive NEC may be cured with surgery;
however, relapse is frequent and associated with a poor prognosis.
The
digestive
NEC
entity
is
completely
different
from
well-
differentiated digestive NET. Patients with localized NET G1-2 have a
5-year survival of 70%–80% while 5-year survival for localized NEC is
25%–40%.11 Furthermore, patients with metastatic small intestinal
NET (G1-G2) have a median survival of 8–10 years and metastatic
pancreatic NET (G1-G2) 3–5 years while median survival for meta-
static digestive NEC treated with chemotherapy is 11–12 months.
In contrast to other cancers where immediate disease progression
on first-line treatment in metastatic disease is rare (<10%–15%),
this is seen after first-line treatment in up to 30% for digestive
NEC and progression free survival (PFS) is only 4–5 months.12–15
This clearly illustrates the aggressiveness of the disease and the
need for improvement of treatment.
Recommendation
Treatment of patients with digestive NEC beyond general established
principles should be considered in a multidisciplinary tumor board set-
ting at a specialized center (grade 5A).

DIAGNOSIS
3.1
|
Q1: What clinical examinations for diagnosis
and staging should be performed in a newly diagnosed
digestive NEC?
Digestive NEC are rarely functional and clinically significant
hormone-related symptoms are almost never seen. Clinical signs
and symptoms are therefore mainly related to the primary
tumor location and tumor burden. Chromogranin A (CgA) and
neuron specific enolase (NSE) in blood are elevated in approxi-
mately 60% of patients.12,16 Recent retrospective data suggest
that elevation of twice the upper normal level of these bio-
markers are prognostic for digestive NEC, but the clinical use-
fulness has to be confirmed in prospective trials.15,16 There is
no evidence for secretion of serotonin from digestive NEC and
measurement of 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid (5-HIAA) is not
recommended. Measurement of other hormones should only be
done when clinical symptoms indicate secretion of that hor-
mone. The mRNA-based NETest has been evaluated for its
prognostic and predictive value in NET,17 but has not been
studied in NEC. Other biomarkers that are elevated in approxi-
mately 20%–30% of patients include CEA and CA19.9, but their
clinical relevance remains to be established.16 Several retro-
spective cohort studies have been performed to identify new
predictive and/or prognostic biomarkers. In a pancreatic NET
G3/NEC study (n = 42), FAS ligand blood level was lower in
NEC compared to control samples.18 To identify regional and
metastatic spread, all patients must be examined by thoracic
and abdominal computerized tomography (CT). Brain CT/MRI
examination is only indicated if clinical signs of brain metasta-
ses are present. Digestive NEC are 18F-FDG PET/CT avid. Due
to the high risk of metastatic disease, we recommend 18F-FDG
PET/CT to be performed for localized disease before surgery
and considered before start of adjuvant chemotherapy to estab-
lish possible metastatic disease as this will have therapeutic
consequences.
18F-FDG
PET/CT
is
generally
not
necessary
when metastatic disease is present, but can be used to estab-
lish tumor burden, as well as the response to chemotherapy.19
Digestive
NEC
may
be
positive
on
somatostatin
receptor
imaging, especially in the lower Ki-67 range (<55%). 68Ga-SSA-
PET-CT is, however, only relevant in the rare cases when
peptide
receptor
radionuclide
therapy
(PRRT)
is
considered
(see Q7).20
Recommendation
No blood biomarkers are established for routine use in digestive
NEC. Thoracic/abdominal CT is mandatory to perform. 18F-FDG
PET/CT should be performed in localized disease (grade 2aB) and
may be performed for advanced disease if the result may alter
selection of treatment.

Q2: What pathological workup is needed for
a newly diagnosed digestive NEC?
3.2.1
|
How to make the diagnosis of NEC
Neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) are poorly differentiated neuro-
endocrine neoplasms (NEN) and have a high-grade proliferative
capacity defined by a Ki-67 >20% (WHO G3), with a Ki-67 usually
>50%. They are classified into small-cell (SC-NEC) and large-cell
type (LC-NEC).21 SC-NEC are characterized by diffuse, non-
organoid architecture with highly atypical small sized cells with
scant cytoplasm, hyperchromatic nuclei and inconspicuous nucle-
oli. LC-NEC are composed of larger cells which display a well-
developed cytoplasm and a polymorphous nucleus with prominent
nucleoli in a subset of cases. Both may commonly exhibit geo-
graphic necrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is mandatory for the
diagnosis of digestive NEC with two recommended neuroendo-
crine markers, synaptophysin and CgA. NEC may lack or express
low level of CgA, especially in SC-NEC. INSM1, a transcription
factor may help in this setting with an 85% sensitivity in NEC.22
The utility of IHC for other neuroendocrine markers, such as
neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and CD56 is hampered by the lack
of specificity for NEN, are generally not used and are discouraged
in digestive NEC. Organ-specific markers, such as TTF1 are of poor
value in NEC. Evaluation of proliferative activity by IHC for Ki-67
indicates rapid tumor growth.
3.2.2

Molecular characteristics of digestive NEC
by next generation sequencing (NGS)
Molecular characteristics of digestive NEC have recently been
described.7,8 Digestive NEC seem to have a lower rate of muta-
tions in TP53 and fewer RB1 alterations compared to SCLC, and
other genes are more frequently altered.7,8 The most frequently
mutated genes in digestive NEC are TP53 (64%), APC (28%), KRAS
(22%), BRAF (20%) and RB1 (14%).7 However, Rb deficiency,
assessed by all genomic alterations (mutations and copy number
alterations) and by protein expression is much more common and
is present in up to 50% of digestive NEC.7,8 Most reports group
different digestive locations with relatively few cases, but alter-
ations seem to vary according to the primary tumor.7,23 Esopha-
geal NEC seem genetically similar to SCLC.24 In the colon
primaries, BRAF, APC and KRAS mutations are most frequent (49%,
40% and 31% respectively). Microsatellite instability (MSI) is seen
in 5% of digestive NEC, associated with BRAF V600E mutation in
the (frequently right) colon.7 The presence of MSI or BRAF V600E
mutation may have consequences for treatment of metastatic dis-
ease. Liquid biopsy with circulating tumor DNA may in the future
be an alternative for molecular tumor analyses in digestive NEC
patients.25

3.2.3

How to distinguish NEC from NET G3
NET G3 have a high proliferation rate with Ki-67 >20%, but are well
differentiated with morphological and molecular similarities to NET
G1-2. The differential diagnosis between NET G3 and NEC (especially
LC-NEC) can be difficult on morphology, even with the help of new
additional histological criteria analyzing the stroma of the tumor.26
Ki-67 alone cannot be used, although a recent report shows that the
55% cutoff is best to discriminate NEC from NET G3.27 When mor-
phology is ambiguous, immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be performed
with a panel of antibodies: ATRX/DAXX (loss of expression favors
pancreatic NET), Menin (loss of expression favors pancreatic/lung
NET), Somatostatin receptor-2 (high expression favors NET), TTF1
(high expression in digestive primary favors NEC), Rb (loss of expres-
sion favors NEC) and p53 (either strong and diffuse expression or
complete loss of expression favors NEC).28 Some of these markers
could be analyzed by NGS testing, especially in case of unclear IHC
result, but IHC-NGS correlation data on large series are so far lacking.
A deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) phenotype is highly suggestive of
NEC, but detected in only 5%–10% of cases.7
3.2.4
|
How to distinguish NEC from
adenocarcinoma expressing NE markers
Conventional digestive adenocarcinoma may express neuroendocrine
markers, preferentially synaptophysin and CD56, and to a lesser
extent CgA. This is reported in colon adenocarcinoma, especially in
dMMR BRAF mutated adenocarcinoma, and possibly associated with
worse prognosis.29 A recent study on 1002 colorectal adenocarci-
noma reports that the percentage of synaptophysin staining tumor
cells has no impact on prognosis in otherwise morphologically
conventional adenocarcinoma, whereas MiNEN (adenocarcinoma
+ NEC) (see Q10) have a worse prognosis.30 This indicates that
synaptophysin IHC should not be performed on typical adenocar-
cinoma, and should be restricted to carcinoma whose morphology
on HE indicates a neuroendocrine differentiation, or shows a neu-
roendocrine component that could indicate a mixed tumor. Distin-
guishing LC-NEC from adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine
features can be difficult, especially when they are poorly differen-
tiated
and
synaptophysin
or
chromogranin
not
diffuse
and
strongly positive. In these cases, the tumor is best classified as an
adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine features.
Recommendation
The histopathological diagnosis of NEC relies on poorly differentiated
morphology, Ki-67 > 20% and positive immunohistochemical staining
for synaptophysin ± CgA (grade 1A). INSM1 can help in cases with
focal/negative CgA expression. When morphology is ambiguous con-
cerning a possible NET G3, a panel of antibodies can be of use includ-
ing p53, Rb1 and if pancreatic primary ATRX, DAXX and Menin.
Testing for MSI and BRAF should be considered if it can influence
treatment choice (grade 2bB).

PROGNOSIS AND PROGNOSTIC
FACTORS
4.1
|
Q3: What are the prognoses and prognostic
factors for digestive NEC?
4.1.1
|
Prognosis
The prognosis for patients with digestive NEC is generally poor
despite recent advances in both diagnostics and treatment. Long-term
relapse-free survival is however possible among patients with local-
ized disease (stage I–III) after multimodality therapy.11 Digestive NEC
data from SEER show a median survival of 33.9 m in patients with
local disease (stage I–II), 16.3 m with locoregional disease (stage III),
and 5.2 m with distant disease.2 Corresponding overall five-year sur-
vival rates were 42%, 25.6%, and 4.7%, but varied depending on pri-
mary tumor site and morphology. Median survival in metastatic
patients not given palliative chemotherapy is one month, and in
patients receiving chemotherapy is 11–12 months.12,13,15,31,32 Pallia-
tive chemotherapy should be considered within 1–2 weeks if possible
since performance status may deteriorate quickly, preventing any
treatment. Two-year survival was 14% and three-year survival was
9.5% in the Nordic NEC cohort receiving palliative chemotherapy.12
4.1.2
|
Prognostic factors
Most data indicate that surgery for localized disease improves sur-
vival, but stage and the primary tumor site is relevant with colon NEC
having the best outcome after surgery (see Q4). Large-cell morphol-
ogy seems to result in a slightly better survival compared to small-cell
morphology in both localized and metastatic disease.2,11,33,34 The
presence of metastatic disease and the number of metastatic sites are
of adverse prognostic significance.15 Performance status (PS) is one of
the most significant prognostic signs and patients with metastatic dis-
ease and PS >1 have a significantly shorter survival: PS 0: 18 m, PS 1:
12 m and PS 2: 5 m.12 Elevated CgA and NSE may be indicative of
a worse prognosis in metastatic disease as well as elevated com-
mon blood tests such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), platelet
count, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase
(ALP).12,15,35 Patients with metastatic disease from esophagus or
large bowel have a worse prognosis compared to other primary
sites.12,13 Cases with a higher proliferation rate (Ki-67 >55%) have a
shorter survival in most studies.12,36 A GI-NEC score to prognosticate
overall survival included five variables: presence of liver metastases,
ALP, LDH, PS and Ki-67, and identified two distinct patient cohorts.37
18F-FDG-PET avid disease correlates with worse prognosis in NEC
patients.38 Emerging data show a possible benefit of analyzing gene
mutations, which may possibly guide treatment.7,8 In contrast to colo-
rectal adenocarcinoma, BRAF V600E mutations do not seem to be
prognostic for colorectal NEC and few prognostic molecular markers
have been found for digestive NEC.39 Rb1 status does not seem to
provide any prognostic information.39–42

Recommendation
Prognostic factors should be taken into consideration when planning
treatment of NEC. The most important prognostic factors to con-
sider for localized disease is the presence of regional lymph node
disease (stage III) and primary tumor site. The most important prog-
nostic factor to consider for metastatic disease is performance
status >1 (grade 3aB).

TREATMENT
5.1
|
Q4: How should surgery, chemoradiation and
neoadjuvant chemotherapy be used in localized (stage
I–III) digestive NEC?
5.1.1
|
Surgery
Surgery is the main potential curative option for digestive NEC, but
5-year survival after surgery only reaches 25%–40% in patients with
initial localized disease (stage I–III). Therefore, even in the setting of
clinically localized disease at diagnosis, many patients have a poor
prognosis with rapid disease progression with a high proclivity for
metastatic dissemination. Optimal staging with
18F-FDG PET/CT
should be performed before consideration of surgery. The data sup-
porting benefit from resection come from retrospective studies noting
that surgery can be curative for patients with digestive NEC who have
apparently localized disease. Data from 1640 localized digestive NEC
showed a 5-year survival of 42% for stage II disease and 25.6% for
stage III disease, with some differences according to the primary
tumor site.2 Among 112 stage I–III digestive NEC patients with an R0
surgical resection, 5-year disease-free survival was 33.8% and 5-year
survival 42%.43 In a recent multicenter study, 60 patients with stage
I–III digestive G3 NEN (72% NEC) had radical surgery with overall sur-
vival (OS) after 2 years 58.5% in the NEC subgroup.44 Among 2245
patients with non-metastatic GEP NEN G3, resection (in 1549
patients) was associated with better long-term outcomes compared to
no surgery at all (5-year OS 39% vs. 10%).45 An obvious bias is that
patients with poor performance status, serious comorbidities or dete-
riorating health status are generally not operated on. In a study of
2314 cases with stage I–III digestive NEC, 5-year survival rate after
surgery was 29.2%, with significant differences according to primary
tumor site and morphology.11 Colon NEC had the best 5-year sur-
vival (39.7%), while gallbladder/biliary NEC the lowest (20.9%).
Small-cell morphology was associated with worse survival compared
to non-small cell histology (17.7 vs. 22.3 m). A multivariable model
showed that even in patients undergoing chemoradiation, surgery
was the only prognostic variable that significantly affected survival
in stages I-II patients (HR 0.63) and showed a strong trend in stage
III patients (HR 0.77). A propensity score matching between
233 digestive non-metastatic NEC patients without surgery and
233 digestive non-metastatic NEC surgical patients, reported that
radical surgery was significantly associated (p < .001) with improved
survival.34
Primary tumor site is a factor when considering surgery in local-
ized digestive NEC, as survival varies according to the primary site.2,11
For localized esophageal NEC, initial surgery seems inferior to initial
chemoradiation, especially for stage III.46,47 In a cohort of 630 pancre-
atic NEC cases, surgery was, after propensity score matching, signifi-
cantly and independently associated with improved survival (36 vs.
8 months).48 In a large colorectal NEC cohort, surgery was a beneficial
prognostic factor for OS in a multivariable analysis.49 In another study
of 502 NEC stage I–III 3-year survival after surgery was 40% versus
18% in cases without surgery.33 Patients with localized non-small cell
colorectal NEC had better survival benefit after surgery (21 vs. 6 m),
compared to small-cell (18 vs. 14 m), questioning the benefit of sur-
gery for localized small-cell anorectal NEC.
5.1.2
|
Chemoradiation
There is remarkably little data on the use of chemoradiation for local-
ized digestive NEC. Many patients have probably been given chemor-
adiation
as
a
part
of
the
initial
treatment
for
a
suspected
adenocarcinoma. The two major questions are: does preoperative
chemoradiation before surgery add benefit compared to surgery alone
and can definite chemoradiation replace surgery? The relatively high
proportion (27%) of margin-positive resections found after surgery
(n = 519) of digestive NEC raises the possibility that down-staging
with neoadjuvant therapy may enhance complete resection rate and
lower the risk of local and systemic recurrence.31
In the US National Cancer Database, radiotherapy for digestive
NEC was frequently used in esophageal (74%), rectal (61%) and anal
(83%) NEC,11 principally in younger patients and in higher stage dis-
ease. Among 127 patients with localized small-cell esophageal carci-
noma,
three-year
survival
was
superior
after
chemoradiation
compared to surgery and chemotherapy (50% vs. 24%).46 Results
were especially better after chemoradiation of stage III disease. All
patients with definitive chemoradiation had a complete response,
43% recurred at other sites, but those without distant recurrence had
a remarkable long survival. Chemoradiation (n = 22) for patients with
locally advanced esophageal NEC resulted in a 77% clinical complete
response rate with a 5-year OS of 45%.50 Postoperative radiotherapy
and/or chemotherapy after esophageal NEC resection (63/67 local-
ized) was associated with significantly better prognosis in one study,
but not for stage I–IIA in another study.51,52 The benefit of chemora-
diation for localized rectal NEC is unknown, with distant recurrence as
the major problem for these patients rather than an isolated local
recurrence. In a recent US study as many as 60% of rectal NEC
received chemoradiation and surgery.11 In patients undergoing che-
moradiation, surgery was still the only prognostic variable that signifi-
cantly improved survival. Chemoradiation may, however, provide
long-term local control in anorectal NEC.53,54 A Surveillance, Epidemi-
ology and End Results (SEER) based analyses of 71 small-cell rectal
cancers found that radiation therapy was associated with improved
survival; however, only 14/28 cases without radiation therapy
received surgery.55 Locally advanced rectal NEC should be discussed

in a multidisciplinary setting, especially in cases of planned major sur-
gery. It seems reasonable to pursue initial chemoradiation for anal
NEC.54
5.1.3
|
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy before surgery) has sev-
eral advantages. It gives an opportunity to treat early possible meta-
static disease while it is microscopic, which might increase survival.
It can downsize the primary tumor, thus improving resectability. Fur-
thermore, it enables better selection of patients that can benefit from
delayed primary tumor surgery, thus avoiding surgery and surgical
morbidity in patients that develop metastatic disease during neoadju-
vant chemotherapy. These advantages are especially relevant for
digestive NEC, which has a high distant recurrence rate after surgery.
In addition, the relatively high proportion (27%) of margin-positive
resections found after surgery of digestive NEC (n = 519) raises the
question if downstaging with neoadjuvant therapy may lower the risk
of systemic recurrence.31 Most localized cases of NEC are however,
initially misdiagnosed as adenocarcinoma in biopsy-based assessments
and initially treated as adenocarcinomas. Many digestive NEC studies
do not separate if chemotherapy was given in adjuvant, neoadjuvant
or perioperative setting, and pure neoadjuvant studies are rare. In a
study (n = 69) of locally advanced gastric NEC/MiNEN, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (various regimens) was associated with improved
survival.56 Among 152 small-cell esophageal cancer patients, survival
and PFS was better in stage III patients who underwent neoadjuvant
chemotherapy.52 Preoperative (n = 54), postoperative (n = 224) and
perioperative chemotherapy (n = 9), were all associated with
improved survival rates in digestive NEC.31 Neoadjuvant chemother-
apy seems to be a reasonable option if the risk of systemic recurrence
is higher than average, or if an observation period is warranted before
possible surgery of the primary tumor to avoid surgery in patients pro-
gressing on chemotherapy.
Recommendation
For fit patients with localized resectable digestive NEC, surgical re-
section should be considered, especially if a simple R0 resection can
be performed.18F-FDG PET/CT should be performed before consider-
ation of surgery. In cases where major surgery is required, individual-
ized treatment decisions can be considered. For localized esophageal
and anal NEC, we suggest initial chemoradiation. The benefit of
chemoradiation for resectable rectal NEC is uncertain. Neoadjuvant

Q5: Should adjuvant chemotherapy be given
for localized (stage I–III) digestive NEC?
The majority of digestive NEC patients with stage II–III undergoing re-
section will develop recurrence, mostly distant, suggesting that there
is a place for adjuvant chemotherapy. Retrospective studies on the
use of adjuvant treatment have at least two major areas of bias:
patients with worse prognostic factors may more often receive adju-
vant chemotherapy, but patients in poor general condition and with
comorbidities may receive adjuvant chemotherapy less frequently. In
a large cohort study with 1861 digestive NEC patients, 519 patients
underwent
curative
resection,
and
postoperative
chemotherapy
(n = 224) was associated with improved survival (HR 0.58).31 A retro-
spective study in 73 localized digestive NEC showed also that chemo-
therapy had a positive prognostic impact on survival.57 Among 2245
patients with localized digestive NEC, 1549 underwent curative resec-
tion.45 Use of chemotherapy in resected patients was associated with
shorter survival in the unadjusted analysis, but the study did not sepa-
rate if chemotherapy was given in the adjuvant setting or as later palli-
ative chemotherapy at recurrence. After propensity score matching,
no survival benefit was seen for patients receiving adjuvant chemo-
therapy (138/276 patients) after surgery for stage I–III gastric NEC.58
Postoperative chemotherapy given to 213/759 cases with gastric,
pancreatic or small-intestinal NEC (unusual high number of small-
intestinal NEC) was not associated with improved survival.59 Postop-
erative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy after esophageal NEC
resection (63/67 localized) was associated with significantly better
prognosis.51 Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy did not increase
survival in stage I–IIA small-cell esophageal carcinoma.52 Among
806 resectable colorectal NEC patients, 49% received adjuvant che-
motherapy with significantly better median and 5-year survival.60 The
results were consistent across subgroups stratified by surgical margin
and pathologic T and N stage. Two other reports also found patients
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for colorectal and rec-
tal NEC had a survival benefit.49,61 Patients with right-sided colorectal
NEC may benefit less from adjuvant treatment compared to those
with left-sided disease.60 None of the studies separated out stage II
and III, but the high recurrence rate also seen in patients with stage II
disease suggest that there is a place for adjuvant treatment also for
stage II. Adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered for stage III cases
and discussed individually for patients with stage II disease. The bene-
fit of adjuvant chemotherapy may depend on the primary tumor site.
The recommended adjuvant chemotherapy regimen has been
4–6 cycles with cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide, based on its
use in the metastatic setting and the 4–6 cycles of cisplatin/etoposide
used together with radiation for limited-stage SCLC.62 The adju-
vant chemotherapy regimen is however not specified in most
digestive NEC studies, although platinum/etoposide was probably
used for the majority of patients. In a Chinese study, adjuvant
chemotherapy was given according to ENETS guidelines, which
was platinum/etoposide58 and in a French study, 86% patients
received platinum/etoposide.57 The high rate of immediate dis-
ease progression seen for this regimen in the metastatic setting
(Q6), may question if platinum/etoposide is the optimal adjuvant
regimen, at least concerning colorectal NEC. Some centers have
therefore preferred an adenocarcinoma regimen (5-FU backbone)
based on the primary tumor site – without any other available data to
support such an approach. The ongoing phase II study comparing

FOLFIRINOX versus platinum/etoposide for metastatic digestive NEC
could provide response rate data to guide future selection of adjuvant
chemotherapy.
Recommendation
Adjuvant chemotherapy with 4–6 cycles of platinum/etoposide may
be considered after radical surgery of localized digestive NEC
(grade 4B).

Q6: What should be given as first-line
treatment for metastatic digestive NEC?
Rapid referral for consideration of first-line palliative chemotherapy is
important given the frequent rapid decline in PS. Based on small-cell
lung cancer treatment, cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with
etoposide has been a cornerstone in the treatment of metastatic
digestive NEC. Retrospective series have shown a response rate
(RR) of 30%–50%, PFS 4–6 m and OS 11–12 m12–15 (Table 2). Imme-
diate disease progression without any benefit of this regimen has
been reported in up to 30% in digestive NEC and 60% in colorectal
NEC12,13 (Table 2), which is higher than 5%–15% usually seen in
oncology. Colorectal primaries seem to have the shortest OS with
only 7.6–8 m.12,13 The NORDIC NEC study found similar RR, PFS
and OS for carboplatin/etoposide and cisplatin/etoposide in diges-
tive NEC.12 Cisplatin should therefore be replaced with the better
tolerated carboplatin. Toxicity rates were comparable between
oral and intravenous etoposide in extra-pulmonary NEC (61/113
digestive), with similar PFS although there was a trend towards a
shorter OS for oral etoposide.63 In Nordic NEC (n = 236), no statis-
tical differences was observed in PFS or OS comparing 24 h etopo-
side infusion (PFS 3.8 m, OS 14.5 m), 2 h etoposide infusion (PFS
5.6 m, OS 11.0 m) or oral etoposide (PFS 5.4 m, OS 11.3 m).64
More data are needed for a final advice on oral etoposide. Most
studies gave 4–6 cycles of platinum/etoposide; the number of
cycles will also depend on the general patient condition and
tolerability.
Given the limited benefit of platinum/etoposide, there have been
attempts to improve first-line treatment. Two recent Asian random-
ized trials comparing cisplatin/etoposide versus irinotecan/cisplatin in
metastatic digestive NEC (mainly upper GI) found no differences in RR
(40%–50%), PFS or OS (10–12 m).32,65 A subgroup analyses observed
that cisplatin/etoposide produced a more favorable OS in cases with
pancreatic NEC; however, this finding should be interpreted with cau-
tion due to the small sample size.32 Both studies showed similar rates
of severe adverse events for both regimens, but different toxicity pro-
files with lower rates of myelotoxicity and greater rates of diarrhea
with irinotecan/cisplatin. Data for FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX in diges-
tive NEC are scarce and restricted to few case series, awaiting results
from a phase II trial comparing FOLFIRINOX versus platinum/
etoposide (NTC04325425). A first-line study of temozolomide/
capecitabine (CAPTEM) versus platinum/etoposide in non-small cell
digestive NEC and NET G3 was closed early due to poor accrual.66
Among 62 evaluable patients, RR, PFS and OS with CAPTEM were
9%, 2.4 m and 12.6 m versus 10%, 5.4 m and 13.6 m with platinum/
etoposide. The study interpretation is limited by including both NET
G3 and NEC patients. Data are insufficient to recommend CAPTEM
as general alternative regimen to the current standard of care. Possi-
ble selection of alternative first-line regimens can be individualized
based on patient features, primary tumor site as well as Ki-67.
Patients with Ki-67 in the lower range (<55%), might be candidates
for less toxic treatments, as they have a lower RR to platinum/etopo-
side.12 Everolimus/temozolomide combination treatment in a first-line
phase II trial had little benefit in digestive NEC.67 The current data are
insufficient to support the first-line use of targeted agents in NEC.
There are no data to support the use of somatostatin analogs in NEC,
and they should not be used in NEC. For possible use of immunother-
apy in first-line treatment- see Q8.

There are scarce data on predictive factors for response to plati-
num/etoposide treatment. Patients with PS 2 had a higher percentage

with
PS

(61%
vs. 26%).12 Non-small-cell NEC (73% digestive), had a worse RR (32%
vs. 55%) and disease control rate compared to small-cell, and worse
PFS if Ki-67 >55%.68 There has been a controversy if Rb1 inactivation
can be used as a marker for treatment benefit of platinum/etoposide.
Increased RR was found for pancreatic NEC with Rb loss and/or KRAS
mutations in fine needle aspiration cytology samples, with no PFS
data and better OS for wild-type.69 Other data have been conflicting,
frequently showing some effect on RR, but not for PFS. In a multicen-
ter trial, Rb status had no significant impact on RR, PFS or OS in plati-
num/etoposide treated metastatic extra-pulmonary NEC patients
(38% digestive).40
Recommendation
Carboplatin/ etoposide is recommended as first-line treatment for
metastatic digestive NEC. Irinotecan/cisplatin may be considered an
alternative option. Other regimens can be considered based on
patient features, primary tumor site as well as Ki-67 (grade 2bB).
Somatostatin analogs should not be used for antiproliferative therapy
in NEC (grade 4B).

Q7: What should be given as second- and
third-line treatment for metastatic digestive NEC?
It remains unclear what is the best second-line therapy in digestive
NEC. Fluoropyrimidines given in combination with either irinotecan
(FOLFIRI), oxaliplatin (FOLFOX/CAPOX) or temozolomide (CAPTEM)
are the most common clinical-practical options in absence of data
from prospective and randomized trials. Evidence supporting the use
of these regimens is quite poor coming mostly from retrospective
series summarized in Table S2 and in a meta-analysis.70 Response
rates are seen in 10%–30%, PFS 2–4 months (range: 1.2–6.0) and OS
5–7 months (range: 3.2–22). Data suggested that temozolomide-
based chemotherapy may be most effective in cases with Ki-67 values
in the 21%–55% range, however, these studies did not include patho-
logical review and might have included NET G3 cases. There is limited
experience with the triple combination regimen FOLFIRINOX (oxali-
platin/irinotecan/fluorouracil). Recently, prospective studies have
reported results on second-line irinotecan-based therapy. A phase II
study comparing FOLFIRI alone versus FOLFIRI + bevacizumab
(n = 133) showed no difference in RR (18%–26%), PFS (3.5–3.7 m) or
OS (7–8.9 m).71 A randomized trial used docetaxel (n = 29) or
liposomal-irinotecan +5-fluorouracil (5FU)/folinic acid (n = 29) in
extra-pulmonary NEC (69% digestive) refractory to platinum-based
chemotherapy.72 Liposomal-irinotecan/5FU achieved RR 10.3%, PFS
3 m, 6 m PFS rate 31% and OS 9 m, but it remains unclear if
liposomal-irinotecan is superior to conventional irinotecan. Studies do
not support the use of docetaxel or topotecan in digestive NEC
(Table S2). Retreatment with platinum/etoposide might be an option
after
a
treatment
break,
as
patients
who
progress
after
discontinuation of first-line treatment may still be platinum sensitive.
In the Nordic NEC study retreatment with the same platinum-based
regimen yielded a response rate of 15%, with another 27% achieving
stable disease.12 Rb1 status did not affect neither PFS nor survival in
second-line treatment (n = 121, 36% digestive).41 BRAF V600E muta-
tions are frequent in colorectal NEC, and a BRAF inhibitor combina-
tion may be a second-line treatment option in BRAF V600E mutated
digestive NEC cases (see Q9). A small metastatic digestive NEC sub-
group of 5% show MSI, which is a tumor-agnostic marker for the ben-
efit of immune checkpoint inhibitors (see Q8).
Surgery for metastatic disease is generally not recommended due
to poor prognosis, rapid disease progression and a short survival, but
may be considered in rare cases for highly selected patients with lim-
ited disease without rapid disease progression where an R0 re-
section
is
possible.
In
a
Nordic
GEP-NEN
G3
database
of
840 patients, 32 patients (24 NEC) had resection or radiofrequency
ablation of liver metastases.73 Five-year survival rate was 43%, with
Ki-67 <55% and adjuvant chemotherapy as independent significant
prognostic factors. There are no data on the use of liver embolization/
SIRT for NEC.
Patients with digestive NEC rarely express somatostatin recep-
tors and in general the expression is weak, therefore very few cases
might be considered for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy
(PRRT). A retrospective study on the use of PRRT in digestive high-
grade NEN (n = 149) mostly as second or further line treatment,
found a RR of 40%. Pathological local reclassification was done in
cases when differentiation status was lacking in the original pathol-
ogy report. Among the NEC subgroup (41%), significantly better PFS
(11 vs. 4 m) and OS (22 vs. 9 m) was seen in cases with Ki-67 <55%
(30% of cases) compared to Ki-67 >55% (11% of cases).20 If there are
spatially discordant (18F-FDG positive/ SRI negative) lesions, PRRT is
contraindicated.74,75
Recommendation
There is no clear standard of care to treat patients with metastatic
digestive NEC who have failed first-line platinum-based chemo-
therapy. Most used and recommended agents in this setting are
fluoropyrimidines in combination with either irinotecan, oxaliplatin
or temozolomide, with the best evidence for irinotecan-based regi-
mens (grade 2bB). Surgery of metastatic disease or PRRT is gener-
ally not recommended (grade 5D).

Q8: Should immunotherapy (immune
checkpoint inhibitors) be used for treatment of
digestive NEC?
Despite the success in the treatment of traditionally similar malignan-
cies such as SCLC and Merkel cell carcinoma, the activity shown by
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in metastatic digestive NEC have
generally been disappointing. In a previous study, the rationale for the
use ICI in NEC was based on a PD-L1 expression between 14% and
50%, a suspected high tumor mutational burden (TMB) and a broad

dendritic cells infiltrating NEN.76

Microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor
mutational burden (TMB)
MSI is seen in 5% of metastatic digestive NEC.7 MSI is an agnostic
tumor marker for the benefit of ICI. The US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) has approved pembrolizumab in pretreated tumors with
MSI regardless of tumor type and site, whereas the European Medi-
cines Agency (EMA) has approved pembrolizumab for only five MSI
tumor types that include endometrial, gastric, small bowel, biliary and
colorectal cancers (histology not specified) in the refractory setting.
Pembrolizumab
has
also
approval
for
first-line
treatment
and
nivolumab + ipilimumab for second-line treatment of MSI metastatic
CRC (adenocarcinoma
not
specified).
Although NEC
were
not
included in the registration studies, we propose that digestive NEC
should be tested for MSI/dMMR with the potential to use ICI if
available.
A high TMB (usually >10 mutations/million base pairs), has a bet-
ter response to ICI, although recent data have shown that this may
vary according to primary tumor site. Pembrolizumab has FDA
approval for unresectable/metastatic solid tumors with high TMB
(>10). The TMB in digestive NEC is generally (and surprisingly) low,
with a median TMB of around 5 in studies.23 Relatively few cases
have TMB >10, and in a recent study 9/10 cases with TMB >10 had
MSI.39 A metastatic NEN ICI study found increased RR in patients
with high TMB or PD-L1 expression ≥10%.77 Identification of targets
predictive of immunotherapy may support the use of ICI as a second-
line treatment. Lack of identification of these markers does not pre-
clude patients from the possible benefit of ICI since reported RR and
6 m PFS rates for dual PD1/CTLA4 blockade are slightly higher in the
largest ICI study in GEP NEC (12% and 15%)78 as compared to
reported mutation rates.
5.5.2

Two strategies in using ICI for NEC: Adding
ICI to first-line treatment or monotherapy ICI (single/
double) in later lines
The NICE-NEC single-arm phase II trial used first-line treatment nivo-
lumab combined with carboplatin/etoposide followed by maintenance
nivolumab in 38 patients with NEN G3 of GEP (82%) or unknown ori-
gin.79 The response rate was 54%, disease control rate 84%, PFS
5.7 months and 39% of patients were free of progression after
6 months. Benefit was less in colorectal primaries. The inclusion of
NET G3 patients (29%) represents a limitation of this study since PFS/
OS are more favorable in NET G3 than NEC. It currently remains
unclear if addition of immunotherapy to standard first-line chemother-
apy results in a better outcome in digestive NEC patients. Data from a
randomized phase II/III study (NCT05058651) will answer this
question.
Interpretation of available studies on ICI for platinum refractory
digestive NEC (2/3-line treatment) is often challenging, due to inclu-
sion of multiple primary sites (including lung), frequent lack of infor-
mation about MSI status and TMB, and lack of details about the type
of GEP NEN G3 enrolled (well differentiated NET G3 or poorly differ-
entiated NEC). Most of the data are in combined populations of
NEC/NET G3.
Studies with single-agent therapy ICI have shown very low
response rates, whereas trials of combined targeting of both PD-(L)1
plus CTLA-4 inhibitors have been more promising, with some patients
achieving long-term disease control. A preliminary report of a retro-
spective evaluation of 34 patients with G3 NEN (79% NEC, 21 GEP)
treated with
nivolumab and ipilimumab reported an objective
response rate of 15% with PFS 1 m.80 A summary of the most rele-
vant prospective studies with ICI in platinum refractory digestive
NEC is shown in Table S3. A prospective study of nivolumab
+ ipilimumab in 19 patients (9 GEP) with G3 NEN (median Ki-67
80%) reported RR 26%, PFS only 2 months but with some long-term
responders as one-third of patients were still progression-free at
6 months.81 A preliminary report of the prospective DUNE study
with durvalumab plus tremelimumab in NEN G3 reported an objected
response rate of 9% and 9 months survival rate of 36% among GEP
NEN G3 patients.82 In the NIPINEC phase II trial, 185 pts (93 GEP
NEC /92 lung NEC) with platinum-refractory disease were random-
ized between nivolumab alone versus nivolumab + ipilimumab.78
The primary endpoint was RR at 8 weeks. RR was 7.2% for nivolu-
mab versus 14.9% for nivolumab/ipilimumab, PFS 1.8 versus 1.9 m
and OS 7.2 m versus 5.8 m. SIx month PFS rate was 15%. The vast
majority of NEC patients do not benefit from ICI. For the few cases
who respond to ICI, median duration of response has been reported
to be 5–21 months, although follow-up is still limited in these trials
(Table S3).
Recommendation
ICI should, if available be considered for metastatic digestive NEC
with MSI and/or high TMB progressing after first-line chemotherapy.
As there are limited treatment options and a potential for durable sus-
tained remission with immunotherapy in some cases, dual ICI may be
an option for later line treatment if available. However, the vast
majority of digestive NEC patients do not benefit from ICI and avail-
able clinical data are not sufficient for the use of ICI in general routine
practice (grade 2bC).

Q9: Is molecular/genetic based therapy an
option for digestive NEC?
Molecular characteristics of digestive NEC have recently been
described (see Q2). Regarding potential treatment selection, the data
are still limited particularly with respect to outcome based on a molec-
ularly selected therapy. Nevertheless, a high fraction of potentially
targetable mutations has been identified in metastatic digestive NEC.7
MSI or high TMB appear at present to be the only possible biomarkers

to predict the benefit of ICI (see Q8). BRAF V600E mutations are
found in 28%–47% of colorectal NEC/MINEN.83,84 This means that
colorectal NEC is among the most frequent BRAF associated solid
malignancies, second only to melanoma and papillary thyroid cancer.
In a recent study, right-sided colon NEC was the only primary tumor
site with a high number of BRAF V600E mutations (in 57%).7 Case
reports have shown benefit of BRAF-inhibitor combination treatment
for BRAF mutated colorectal NEC.85 The combination of a BRAF- and
EGFR-inhibitor (encorafenib + cetuximab) has EMA/FDA approval
for second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Although
the registration studies only included adenocarcinoma cases, the
approval is not limited to these. FDA granted in 2022 accelerated
approval for the BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination dabrafenib
+ trametinib for patients with advanced solid tumors with a BRAF
V600E mutation as a tumor agnostic indication. Other mutations
with a targeted therapy available are not frequent in digestive NEC
(KRAS G12C 3%, RET mutations 3%, HRAS mutation 0.5%, NTRK
fusions 0.3%).
Recommendation
In BRAF V600E mutated digestive NEC cases, a BRAF inhibitor com-
bination is an option to consider. Since druggable key mutations are
present in NEC, we recommend early molecular profiling by panel
sequencing (grade 4A).

Q10: How should high-grade digestive
MiNEN be diagnosed and treated?
5.7.1
|
How to make the diagnosis of MiNEN and
to distinguish it from NEC
Epithelial
tumors
composed
of
a
neuroendocrine
and
a
non-
neuroendocrine component are called in all digestive locations “mixed
neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms” (MiNEN).86 On HE
stained sections the two components are clearly separated, with the
arbitrary threshold of 30% each. Therefore, it is impossible to formally
diagnose a MiNEN on a biopsy sample, where just a description of the
two components is feasible. Moreover, the diagnosis can frequently
be missed in biopsies of metastases, as recently shown in 80 digestive
MiNEN patients where 71% of patients had only the NEN component
present in the metastases.87 MiNEN are especially frequent in the
colon or stomach, in which the adenocarcinoma component is usually
combined with LC-NEC.88,89 They are infrequent in the appendix,
since the former “goblet cell carcinoid” is now classified among exo-
crine tumors as goblet cell adenocarcinoma. The prognosis of colon
MiNEN (adenocarcinoma + NEC) is worse than for the adenocarci-
noma subtypes90 and is related to the Ki-67 index of the NEC compo-
nent.91 Molecular studies have reported similar profiles in digestive
NEC and MiNEN. Colorectal MiNEN and LC-NEC share genetic
alterations with adenocarcinomas, such as mutations in APC, KRAS,
TP53 genes as well as MSI, suggesting a possible common clonal
origin.92
5.7.2
|
Treatment of MiNEN
The MiNEN entity is complex and treatment controversial. Surgery is
the only potential curative option for initial localized digestive MiNEN.
5-year survival after surgery has been reported to be 20%–50%.58,89
In seven retrospective studies on digestive NEC/MiNEN, a positive
prognostic effect of surgery was indicated with PFS 8–32 months and
OS 21–92 months.93 A recent study found no differences in OS or
DFS between high-grade NEN and MiNEN after surgery.43 This indi-
cates that patients with MiNEN like NEC can benefit from surgery if an
R0 resection can be obtained. In a large retrospective study, gastric
MiNEN or gastric NEC had a worse prognosis after surgery com-
pared to gastric adenocarcinoma.58 Possible use of radiotherapy and
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in localized MiNEN could be discussed
in a multidisciplinary setting, as scarce data are available. The benefit
of adjuvant chemotherapy after radical surgery has not been proven
for MiNEN, but the high recurrence rate and adjuvant data from
digestive NEC and adenocarcinoma support consideration of adju-
vant chemotherapy at least in cases with affected lymph nodes.
Which adjuvant chemotherapy regimen to use after radical surgery,
that is a NEC or adenocarcinoma regimen, might depend on the pre-
dominant component, considering always not only the more preva-
lent, but the more aggressive histology. One option is to base the
adjuvant regimen on the tumor component present in the regional
lymph nodes. In a study of 80 patients with digestive MiNEN, 69%
had only one component metastasized to lymph nodes, usually the more
aggressive NEC component (42/55).87 Lymph node metastatic pattern
seemed to be associated with the proportion of the two components
within the primary. The high immediate progression rate that platinum/
etoposide has for metastatic NEC may question if this regimen is the opti-
mal adjuvant regimen for at least colorectal MiNEN. In a European study,
use of adjuvant/neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation
were more commonly in adenocarcinoma-like than NEC-like cases.89
After propensity score matching, no survival benefit was seen for patients
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (134/268 patients) after surgery for
stage I–III gastric MiNEN.58
Clinical management of metastatic disease is controversial as
there are only retrospective series with limited sample sizes. It
remains unclear whether MiNEN should be treated as a NEC or an
adenocarcinoma. At present, there appears to be two main opinions in
the field: Treatment should be based on the predominant histological
component or treatment should target the more aggressive compo-
nent within the tumor, regardless of proportion as even a minor NEC
component can impact prognosis. As OS in MiNEN is extremely poor
in the majority of patients, with median OS very similar to NEC and
the neuroendocrine component is judged by many to be the most rel-
evant one,89 it has been argued for the use of platinum-etoposide as
the backbone treatment of MiNEN. Moreover, this is in line with the
finding that most distant metastases are composed of NEC or mixed
components, regardless of the proportion of the two components in
the primary. Among 34 digestive MiNEN patients, 71% had only the

The choice of systemic treatment for metastatic digestive MiNEN
seems at present to vary considerably whether a NEC regimen (plati-
num/etoposide) or an adenocarcinoma regimen (5FU-backbone based
on primary tumor site) is chosen as the first-line treatment strategy89
and might depend on clinician (e.g., NEN vs. digestive oncologist) and
center experience. Regimens used for digestive adenocarcinoma have
proven to be active for digestive NEC in later lines (see Q7). Perform-
ing tumor tissue NGS could potentially help to select the systemic
treatment for these patients especially if MSI or a BRAF V600E muta-
tion is found.
Recommendation
Patients with localized digestive MiNEN should be considered for sur-
gery and adjuvant chemotherapy (grade 3bB). First-line treatment of
metastatic MiNEN is controversial, both platinum/etoposide and
fluoropyrimidines in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan may be
considered (grade 5D).

SUMMARY
This ENETS guidance study, developed by a multidisciplinary working
group, provides up-to-date and practical advice on the diagnosis and
management of digestive neuroendocrine carcinoma, based on recent
developments and study results. These recommendations aim to pave
the road for more standardized care for our patients resulting in
improved outcomes. Prognosis is generally poor for digestive NEC,
most are advanced at diagnosis and median survival in metastatic dis-
ease is 11–12 months. Surgery can be of benefit for localized disease
after extensive preoperative imaging. Carboplatin in combination with
etoposide is recommended as first-line treatment for metastatic dis-
ease. Irinotecan with fluoropyrimidines has the best evidence as
second-line
treatment.
Immunotherapy
plays
a
minor
role
in
biomarker-unselected patients. Molecular profiling if available is
encouraged to identify new targets. More prospective clinical trials
are highly needed to fulfil the unmet needs in this field, especially on
new predictive and prognostic biomarkers and to improve survival of
patients with advanced disease.
