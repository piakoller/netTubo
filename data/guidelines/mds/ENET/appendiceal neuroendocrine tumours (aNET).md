Abstract
The aim of the present guidance paper is to update the previous ENETS guidelines on
well differentiated appendiceal neuroendocrine tumours (NET), providing practical
guidance for the diagnosis and management of appendiceal NET (aNET); poorly differ-
entiated neoplasms are dealt with in a separate guidance paper. This paper is structured
on a question-answer format in order to also address controversial issues and areas
where uncertainty regarding the management and follow-up of aNET exists. All recom-
mendations are offered on the basis of the best available evidence, along with the
authors' experiences in managing these neoplasms. Each recommendation for treat-
ment will provide a level of evidence and grade of recommendation as per the GRADE
system (adapted in Infectious Disease Society of United States Public Health Service
grading system).

INTRODUCTION
Appendiceal neuroendocrine tumours account for 50%–77% of all
appendiceal neoplasms and are mostly identified incidentally following
appendicectomy for acute appendicitis or after a laparotomy per-
formed for unrelated reasons.1,2 In the great majority, aNET are low
grade (>80% grade 1, G1) and very rarely, if ever, are associated with
a secretory syndrome.2,3 Based on the mode of identification and the

absence of neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN)-related symptoms, no
NEN-related specific diagnostic tools are needed before surgical inter-
vention, and in the great majority of cases no oncological resection is
performed. Although appendicectomy alone is usually a sufficient
treatment, a number of histopathological parameters are currently
considered to be associated with an increased risk of regional lymph
node involvement (LN+) raising the issue of further surgery. This has
traditionally been performed in the form of right hemicolectomy
(RHC), to ensure an adequate oncological resection. ENETS, based on
mainly retrospective studies dealing with the management and prognosis
of such patients, in 2016 issued practical guidelines to identify patients
who are at risk for either concurrent residual disease to the lymph nodes
(LN) or development of future recurrence and/or metastases.3 However,
there is still debate as to which are the most robust histopathological
parameters justifying RHC or if a less aggressive surgical approach is
preferable, and what is the prognostic significance of LN+ and their
effect on patients' overall survival (OS). Furthermore, there are no clear-
cut recommendations regarding the need and kind of further investiga-
tions needed in patients considered candidates for completion surgery
following initial appendicectomy. In addition, there is a lack of recom-
mendations for the need and type of any additional treatment in patients
at higher risk for developing more extensive disease. There is also no
established protocol describing the mode and duration of follow-up of
patients undergoing further operation along with the sequalae of the
procedure and its impact on the patient's quality of life.
All these issues will be addressed based on the following
question-answer format.
1. What is the current incidence of aNET (G1-3)?
2. Which are the pathological parameters that need to be provided
for further decision-making?
3. How common are LN and distant metastases and carcinoid syndrome
(CS) in appendiceal NET? Is LN status an acceptable surrogate of OS?
4. Is there any indication for biochemical and/or imaging modalities
to be utilised for tumour staging following appendicectomy?
5. Which are the robust criteria necessitating treatment decisions;
completion RHC vs. appendicectomy alone? Is the benefit of
RHC of aNET on OS proven?
6. When completion oncological surgery is recommended, is RHC
always required or could ileocaecal resection be sufficient, and what
is the impact of these procedures on patients' comorbidities/QoL?
7. Is there any need for adjuvant therapy in patients with aNET
without distant metastases?
8. How should advanced disease be managed?
9. What is the recommended follow-up protocol after RHC in patients
with or without LN+ ? How is follow-up in aNET justified?

WHAT IS THE CURRENT INCIDENCE OF
ANET (G1-3)?
Neuroendocrine tumours of the appendix are rare but are one of the
most frequent gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) NEN, with an incidence
previously reported to be 0.1–0.6/100.000 per year. However, in
more recent studies the incidence of aNET has been found to be as
high as 0.97/100.000 per year and 1.4/100.000 per year, respec-
tively.4,5 Improved registration and referral to specialised NET centres
may explain this increase, although a real increase in incidence cannot
be excluded. Appendiceal NET constitute about 45%–77% of all
appendiceal neoplasms.2,5–11
Appendiceal NET are more frequently found in women, ranging
between 55% and 70% in different studies.5,7,8,10–12 The median age
at diagnosis is 25–40 years, with a range of 4–95 years.5–8,10–12 The
majority of aNET are found in patients operated on for acute appendici-
tis (80%). The remaining aNET are found in patients undergoing RHC
due to colorectal adenocarcinoma or inflammatory bowel disease, and
in women having an appendicectomy in relation to surgery for gynaeco-
logical disease. More than 90% of the aNET are first diagnosed on path-
ological examination of the surgical appendix specimen.5
Most aNET are located in the tip of the appendix, are less than
2 cm in size, and are G1 (Table 1).5–8,10–13 Two main histological types
of aNET are described; the EC (enterochromaffin)-cell aNET, similar to
ileal enterochromaffin cells (EC-cell NET) that are serotonin-positive,
and the L-cell aNET, with a trabecular pattern, that are serotonin-
negative, glucagon positive and chromogranin B rather than chromo-
granin A positive (CgA).5 A rare subtype is tubular aNET, which should
be distinguished from adenocarcinomas.14

Recommendations
1. Appendiceal NET are the most common appendiceal neoplasms.
They are increasing in incidence and consist of two distinct cell
types (2b-B).
2. The majority are diagnosed following appendicectomy for acute
appendicitis or after laparotomies for other pathologies (2b-Β).

WHICH ARE THE PATHOLOGICAL
PARAMETERS THAT NEED TO BE PROVIDED
FOR FURTHER DECISION-MAKING?
Appendiceal NET are mostly of small size, <1 cm, frequently associ-
ated with an inflammatory reaction, and may not be visible to the
surgeon or even the pathologist on macroscopy. Thus, embedding the
entire tip in two longitudinal pieces along with the body and
resection margin in transverse sections is advised.14 Subsequent steps
for a complete and adequate report are included in the recent ENETS
publication (Pathology Synoptic Reporting) that contains templates for
well defined, reproducible and standardised pathological features and
biomarkers.15 The systematic use of this template is aimed at increas-
ing the comparability of the parameters between different retrospec-
tive series from 1990 to 2019. Problems have occurred due to
missing parameters, variability in interpretation of histoprognostic
factors, and confusion of interpretation of pathology reports because
of modifications of the classification (Table 1).

3.1

Morphological analysis and mandatory
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
As for all digestive NET, morphological analysis is completed by
mandatory IHC staining for CgA and synaptophysin to confirm the
neuroendocrine nature of aNET and evaluate their proliferative
activity (Ki-67 index).14–16 Additional immunohistochemical stains to
identify hormones can also be performed (see Q1). Recent studies
have demonstrated a high expression of serotonin, and to a lesser
extent glucagon, serotonin being associated with worse pathological
factors.5,13
3.2
|
Tumour size
Tumour size, corresponding to the largest diameter, is measured
on microscopy slices since most tumours are not detected on macro-
scopy. This is a fundamental criterion for deciding on further surgery,
as tumours larger than 2 cm in their greatest diameter are generally
treated by oncologic completion RHC (see Q5). Tumours >2 cm are
relatively rare with great variations in their frequency between studies
(3% to 24%, Table 1).
3.3
|
Localisation of tumour
Localisation of tumour (tip, base or close to the base) has to be
reported. The most common location is the tip (51%–86%), rarely the
base (3%–11%) (Table 1). Ιn cases of R0 resection the minimal
distance to resection margins should be noted.
3.4
|
Local extension
The microscopic tumour extension has to be noted, that is, the
maximal infiltration in the various layers of the wall.15 This is possible
on haematoxylin and eosin (HE) stains, substantiated further with CgA
IHC that helps to find small infiltrative nests as synaptophysin strongly
stains the myenteric plexus. The depth of mesoappendix infiltration
(i.e., < or >3 mm) proposed in the ENETS 2006 classification17 is also
incorporated in the ENETS standardised reporting.15 However, this
level of extension in the mesoappendix is reported in only 39% (range
8%–64%) of cases in recent studies (Table 1).
3.5
|
Vessel invasion
Vessel invasion includes blood vessel invasion and lymphatic vessel
invasion and are both recommended by the ENETS synoptic reports
for aNET.15 However, whereas vessel invasion is reported in the
majority of recent retrospective studies, in 94% of 2076 cases at ini-
tial surgery, blood and lymphatic vessel invasion were not separated
except in one study in RHC specimens only10 (Table 1, see Q5). In that
study, 12% and 17% of patients had blood vessel and lymphatic
vessel invasion respectively, with the latter having a greater risk of
LN+10 (see Q5). However, separating blood from lymphatic vessel inva-
sion
can
be
difficult
morphologically
with
low
interobserver
reproducibility.8
Perineural invasion (Pn) is also a factor included in the ENETS
standardised report although it is rarely reported in retrospective
studies.15 It has been analysed in two recent studies and was detected
in 28% and 10% of cases, respectively11,13 (see Q5).
3.6
|
TNM staging
In addition to WHO differentiation and grading, the TNM staging is
mandatory including the criteria described: size, maximal depth of
parietal infiltration (submucosa, muscularis propria, subserosa or
serosa), blood vessel invasion (V0/V1), lymphatic vessel invasion
(L0/L1), perineural invasion (Pn0/Pn1) and resection margins (R0/R1/R2).
To classify as pT, the last eighth edition of UICC TNM is recom-
mended although it does not take into account aNET with size
between 1 and 2 cm, as all ≤2 cm aNET are considered as pT118; the
ENETS TNM, while modified since 2006, is also frequently considered
(Table 2). All successive TMN versions may produce confusion, espe-
cially when analysing data from retrospective studies that have been
performed over prolonged periods of time (Table 2).18 In all TNM clas-
sifications, the definition of pT4 refers to serosal perforation with or
without infiltration of adjacent organs.18 In a recent ENETS sponsored
retrospective Europe-wide pooled cohort study of 1–2 cm aNET in
size, serosal perforation/pT4 was found in 18.7% (52/273) of cases.19
However, only two of these 52 cases associated with metastatic peri-
toneal spreading had a pathologically-confirmed serosal perforation.
Moreover, these two patients were successively treated by electro-
coagulation of peritoneal metastases or RHC, and none of the
52 patients developed disease recurrence or died during a follow-up
period of >10 years.19
These findings highlight the importance of obtaining the proper
definition of pT4 that is probably difficult to be made in an inflamma-
tory appendix, where the inflammation itself can be responsible for
the
perforation.
Therefore,
true
tumour
infiltration
responsible
for perforation and peritoneal spreading (pT4) is probably over-
estimated in this context. The pathological analysis must be specific
and perforation secondary to appendicitis should not be reported as
pT4, but only when this is directly related to the tumour itself.
3.7

Recommendations
1. A complete histopathological assessment using updated synoptic
report templates (see ENETS synoptic reports) irrespective of the
size of the tumour should be used including the following parame-
ters: tumour size and localisation, morphological analysis and
immunohistochemical
staining
for
neuroendocrine
markers
and
grading,
local
extension,

(angioinvasion), invasion of lymphatic vessels, perineural extension
and TNM staging (2a-B).
2. Special attention should be paid to defining direct serosal involve-
ment by the aNET. Appendicitis-related perforation must be distin-
guished from a true pT4 tumour perforation, the frequency of
which is probably greatly overestimated (2b-B).

HOW COMMON ARE LN AND DISTANT
METASTASES AND CARCINOID SYNDROME
(CS) IN APPENDICEAL NET? IS LN STATUS AN
ACCEPTABLE SURROGATE OF OS?
Similar to many other tumours, aNET can potentially invade adjacent
organs and metastasise to regional LN and rarely to distant sites.
Previous studies that evaluated LN+ in aNET have also included appen-
diceal neoplasms that were not diagnosed with the currently accepted
histopathological criteria such as “goblet cell carcinoids” that are cur-
rently classified as adenocarcinomas.3,20 In particular, the Surveillance
Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program Database analysis has
reported the presence of LN+ in 49% of patients with aNET.3,21 A
number of retrospective institutional or multicentre studies that have
recently been published, having exclusively included patients of vari-
ous tumour sizes diagnosed with currently acceptable histopathologi-
cal criteria for aNET, have revealed a significantly lower figure of
approximately 5.6%.5–8,10–13 In a recent study of aNET sized 1–2 cm
the estimated figure was 12.8% based on a logistic model19 (Table 3).
All these recent studies are believed to have produced more reliable
data regarding LN+ and its potential implications along with the pres-
ence of synchronous or metachronous metastases and the presence
of CS (Table 3).
Moreover, from a total of 2267 aNET patients included in these
studies, 568 (25%) underwent RHC based on the 2016 ENETS guide-
lines.3,5–8,10–13,19 Of patients who underwent RHC and for whom
complete histopathological data were available, (Tables 1 and 3),
120/495 (24.2%) were found to have LN+, albeit with a wide range
of 17%–32% amongst the different studies.
Previous studies have also described patients with distant metas-
tases secondary to aNET as well as the presence of CS.3,22,23
However, it is not entirely clear whether these distant metastases
were directly related to the aNET or other coexisting NET, whereas
the presence of the CS was most likely associated with a small intesti-
nal primary NET.3,10,22 This view is also supported in the Negri study
of 1–2 cm aNET, where the presence of distant metastatic disease in
five out of nine patients was attributed to a coexisting NEN, most
commonly a small bowel NET.19 Considering also the data derived
from all the recently published studies, metastatic disease was
described in 12 (8 synchronous) patients (12/2267, 0.5%), whereas
aNET-related deaths were described in seven patients although pre-
cise information is provided in only three of them; in addition, the
duration of follow-up varied significantly5–8,10–13,19 (Table 3). Only
one case of CS has been described in a patient with a G2 aNET (Ki-67
8% in the primary tumour and 12% in liver metastases) who died
within 9 months after diagnosis, exhibiting a clinical course that is
extremely rare for aNET12 (Table 3).
Data regarding the potential effect of LN+ in patients with aNET
have been inconsistent in previous studies. However, a recent analysis
of the SEER database that included 215 patients with apparent
well differentiated aNET (period 2004–2012, median follow-up
44 months) who underwent RHC found that 120/215 (55.5%) had LN
+ versus 95/215 (44.5%) who did not have any LN involvement (LN-).
Although this number of LN+ is much higher compared to those
obtained from the recent studies (Table 3), probably due to the inclu-
sion of other poorly-defined neoplasms, the OS of apparent well-
differentiated aNET with LN+ versus LN- was similar at least for the
specific follow-up period.20 Similarly, all recent studies have shown
that OS is not affected by LN+ although in one of the studies there
was a trend for better OS in LN- compared to LN+ patients, albeit not
statistically significant, and which could be related to the design of
that study.8
Recently Nesti et al. evaluated LN+, metastatic disease and OS in
278 aNET of 1–2 cm in size.19 A total of 115 patients underwent
RHC in the presence of previously considered “high-risk factors” for
harbouring LN+.3,19 From these 115 patients, 19.6% were LN+.19
Synchronous metastatic disease was reported in nine patients, but
after central review only four metastases were considered as possibly
or probably of appendiceal origin, including two cases with peritoneal
spread related to the serosal perforation from the primary tumour.
In two cases with liver metastases, the diagnosis was suggested but
not further confirmed due to the absence of tumour samples.19

Recommendations
1. LN+ is relatively uncommon in aNET, and even in the presence of
apparent “high-risk factors” only a fourth at most of patients will
be found to have LN+ following RHC (2b-B).
2. LN+ is not associated with increased risk of recurrence or meta-
static disease and is not related to OS (2b-B).
3. Metastatic disease is extremely rare, and when present necessi-
tates the exclusion of a concomitant NEN, most commonly an ileal
NET (2b-B).

IS THERE ANY INDICATION FOR
BIOCHEMICAL AND/OR IMAGING
MODALITIES TO BE UTILISED FOR TUMOUR
STAGING FOLLOWING APPENDECTOMY?
Following confirmation of an aNET after appendicectomy, the aim of
these modalities is to identify patients in whom appendicectomy is
curative and patients who may have residual disease and could be
candidates for further treatment.2,3 However, there is currently pau-
city of data as to whether any form of commonly employed NEN bio-
markers [such as CgA and/or 5-HIAA (5-hydroxy-indole-acetic-acid)]
or imaging studies are needed, and when these should be utilised.2,3
Although some studies have found increased CgA levels in patients
with metastatic disease, this has not been extensively studied in aNET
whereas the sensitivity of CgA in identifying low-burden residual dis-
ease, particularly in the LN, is limited.3,23,24 Similarly, although the CS
has been described in some patients with aNET, epidemiological stud-
ies have shown that this is extremely rare and thus 5-HIAA estimation
in 24 h urine samples or plasma measurements are not routinely per-
formed (Table 3). However, these biomarkers could be utilised if, after
an appendicectomy, patients are found to have distant metastases or
exhibit symptoms of the CS, although with low probability that these
may be directly related to aNET.2,3,19 Very few data are currently
available regarding the role of new more sensitive biomarkers such as
the NETest in identifying residual disease,25 while the role of circulat-
ing tissue DNA has not been explored as yet in these patients.26
In aNET with tumour size >2 cm, imaging of the abdomen with
computerised tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and CgA measurement are performed, as the possibility of metastatic
disease increases in such lesions.2,3 Although many would also recom-
mend imaging in aNET with a high Ki-67 proliferation index, there is
no consensus or evidence as to whether this approach should be
undertaken irrespective of tumour size and which Ki-67 value should
be considered as the appropriate cutoff level.2 Similarly, following the
findings of the Nesti et al. study, tumour serosal infiltration (pT4)
could also constitute a potential risk factor for peritoneal spreading
but this event was very rare (2/273 cases in 1–2 cm aNET); these two
cases were cured by peritoneal local ablation with no deleterious
effect on survival.19 Previous guidelines have suggested that somato-

(68Ga-DOTA-SSTRT-PET/CT), should be employed in the presence of
suspected distant metastases or when curative resection was not
completely assured.3 A recent retrospective study that evaluated the
routine early role of 68Ga–DOTA-TATE-PET/CT in order to evaluate
residual disease in aNET, including patients with “high-risk” histopatho-
logical features, such as size >2 cm and Ki-67 values >2%, concluded
that there was no added value if performed within 18 months following
appendicectomy.27 However, cases where 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRT-PET/CT
has identified residual disease in the LN and elsewhere have also been
described, but these results should be considered with caution following
the findings of several studies where the majority of the metastases
found were related to a coexisting NEN, mainly ileal.19,22,23
5.1

Recommendations
1. Conventional existing non-specific markers, such as CgA and
5-HIAA levels, are of limited value in identifying residual or localised
disease following appendectomy (4-C). They can be used though in
the presence of distant metastases and in the rare cases of CS after
excluding a concomitant small intestinal NET (Figure 1) (4-B).
2. Morphological (CT/MRI) imaging could be considered in patients
with robust “high risk factors” for residual or more advanced disease
such as aNET >2 cm in size and high G2 and G3 tumours (4-C).
3. Functional imaging (preferable with 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRT-PET/CT)
could be performed in the presence of positive findings on mor-
phological imaging (4-B).

WHICH ARE THE ROBUST CRITERIA
NECESSITATING TREATMENT DECISIONS;
COMPLETION RHC VS. APPENDICECTOMY
ALONE? IS THE BENEFIT OF RHC OF ANET
ON OS PROVEN?
Current ENETS guidelines recommend completion RHC in the pres-
ence of aNET size >2 cm, cases of R1/2 resection, or aNET of 1–2 cm
in
size
in
the
presence
of
additional
“risk
factors”
such
as
mesoappendiceal invasion (MAI) >3 mm, Ki-67 values >2% and vessel
invasion.3 However, there are currently no prospective data available
to evaluate the validity of these “risk factors” as to whether:
1. They can accurately predict the presence of LN+ and/or distant
disease.
2. LN+ is a surrogate marker of local/distant recurrence and/or OS.
3. Performing RHC avoids distant recurrence and improves OS.
Over the last years a number of studies that included aNET
patients diagnosed with the currently defined histopathological cri-
teria have tried to address these issues5–8,10–12,19 (Tables 1 and 3). Of
the patients operated, based on the previously mentioned “high risk
factors” for LN+, 17% to 30% were found to have LN+ with the most
consistent risk factor being tumour size >2 cm. Other risk factors that
were also identified, albeit not in all studies, were: tumour grade, MAI,
microscopic invasion of the resection margin (R1 status), vessel
invasion, and Pn invasion.5–8,10–12
6.1
|
Tumour size
Tumour size >2 cm is considered the most important criterion for
the decision for RHC in the ENETS, NANETS, NCCN, UKINETS,
and TNCD guidelines.3,28–31 None of these guidelines recommend
RHC in case of aNET <10 mm; these recommendations differ for
aNET measuring between 10 and 20 mm. For this latter group, sev-
eral different tumour size cutoffs have recently been proposed
capable to predict LN+ that range from 13 mm (area under ROC
curve-AUROC of 0.89 [0.85–0.94]),5 15.5 mm (AUROC of 0.75
[0.64–0.87]),8 and 19.5 mm.11 However, it appears as the 2 cm is
probably the best cutoff level as it is associated with the highest
percentage of LN+ compared to smaller sized tumours. The per-
centage of LN+ in aNET according to their size (<1, 1–2, >2 cm)
after RHC is highly variable ranging between 15%–24%,10,11 32%–
38%,10,11 and 43%–57%.6,10,11 However, it should be noted that
these patients were selected for RHC due to the presence of vari-
ous “high-risk” factors and an element of bias is likely to be
present.6,10,11

Mesoappendiceal invasion (MAI)
MAI >3 mm in case of an aNET of 1–2 cm in size is found in 4%–34%
of cases and is considered a risk factor favouring RHC in several
guidelines (ENETS, NANETS, UKINETS, TNCD),3,28–30 but not in the
NCCN.31 However, there are no clear data in the literature to prove
that 3 mm is the most valid size limit for performing RHC. MAI was
associated with LN+ after multivariate analysis in one, identifying
a MAI of 1 mm as the optimal cutoff value (AUROC of 0.72
(0.58–0.86),5 but not in other studies.8,11
6.3
|
R1 (microscopic invasion of resection margin)
This is encountered in 5% (range 3%–8%) of cases and more often in
aNET localised at the appendiceal base. R1 status was associated
with LN+ after multivariate analysis in one but not all studies.5,8
However, irrespective of its association with LN+, R1 resection is
considered as an indication for further surgery to eradicate any
residual disease.2,3 An independent robust relationship between the
location of aNET at the appendiceal base and the risk of LN+ has
not been established and does not appear sufficient to justify RHC
when the resection is R0 without any other worse prognostic
factors.
6.4
|
Vessel invasion
The presence of vessel invasion of aNET 1–2 cm in size is found in
7%–12% of cases and is one risk factor favoring RHC in several
guidelines including ENETS, NANETS, UKINETS, TNCD3,28–30 but
not in the NCCN.31 Vessel invasion was associated with LN+ after
univariate analysis but not after multivariate analysis in two
studies.8,11
6.5
|
Perineural invasion (Pn)
This risk factor is not included in the TNCD, ENETS, NCCN,
NANETS3,28,29,31 guidelines, but is included in UKINETS30 for 1–2 cm
tumour size aNET. This was not often evaluated in most of the recent
studies,5,6,8,12 but was found to be associated with LN+ in 2/6
(33%)23 and 6/15 patients (40%)11 respectively when examined.
Further studies are warranted to evaluate the significance of this factor.
6.6
|
Tumour grade
The majority of aNET, 82%–94%, are G1 and only 0.02%–1% were
G3 in the main recent studies with available data (Table 1). Although
no direct association between LN+ and grade was found in several
studies, this is most probably related to the small number of aNET
harbouring higher-than-G1 tumours. Only one study demonstrated a
statistically significant correlation between grade and LN+, as 8/9
patients with G2 aNET had LN+ that was not affected by tumour
size.10,12 Furthermore, patients who developed extensive disease or
experienced recurrence had mostly G2 or G3 aNET respectively.11,12
However, there are currently insufficient data to suggest a specific
Ki-67 cutoff value amongst patients with G2 aNET that confers a
higher risk for LN+, although it could be speculated that there could
be a continuum in the risk based on increasing Ki-67 values similar to
other GEP-NET.
All current data indicate that tumour size >2 cm is the most con-
sistent risk factor associated with LN+ (Tables 1 and 3). All other
remaining “high risk” factors are not consistently verified in all studies,
whereas in some studies the presence of more than one “high risk”
factor was not associated with LN+ following RHC.5,32 Although this
could be related to the retrospective nature of the studies and the
lack of central histology review, it raises concerns as to whether
the presence of these apparent “high risk” factors should be an indica-
tion for RHC. This is clinically significant as the great majority of the
recent, albeit retrospective studies, have not established that LN+ is a
surrogate marker of local/distant recurrence and/or OS particularly in
1–2 cm tumours.19 It needs to be explored, though, whether a specific
Ki-67 cutoff value could be as robust an indicator as tumour size,
favouring RHC, considering that many patients harbouring G2 aNET
are found to have LN+,10,12 whereas the role of Pn invasion needs to
be more extensively studied.11,23 Considering existing limitations, a
meta-analysis of most of the recent publications found that size
>2 cm, vessel invasion and Pn invasion were predictive of LN+.9
Another meta-analysis also found size and vessel invasion being asso-
ciated with LN+.33
Although no prospective studies are available to provide high
quality data regarding the validity of “high-risk” factors in predicting
residual disease, synchronous or metachronous metastatic disease
and/or their association with OS, indirect data can be extrapolated
from studies where patients fulfilling the criteria for RHC did not
undergo the procedure. A total of 19 of 29 paediatric patients who
fulfilled one or more of the previously mentioned “high-risk” factors
did not undergo RHC and were only followed up, without any recur-
rences been detected.34 A subsequent meta-analysis in children evalu-
ated 37 studies including 958 patients, 120 of whom fulfilled the
criteria for RHC but had only an appendicectomy.35 After a median
follow-up of 4.8 years no recurrences were detected.35 Similarly, in an
adult series, 15/6412 and 4/346 of patients who fulfilled at least one
“high-risk” factor were also followed-up with a median of 31 months
(range 14–138 months) and 4.7 years (range 4.3–12.9) without under-
going RHC, respectively. None of these patients had evidence of
recurrence, metastatic disease or died as a result of the aNET.6,12,34
Considering that these patients had a 17%–30% probability of having
LN+ it appears that this was not associated with an adverse outcome.
However, the number of adult patients included and duration of
follow-up do not allow for any strong conclusions to be drawn from
these studies.
A recently published study evaluated 178 aNET patients with
tumour size 1–2 cm who fulfilled at least one of “high-risk factor” for

RHC as defined in the 2016 ENETS guidelines.3,19 The authors found
that long-term OS was similar in patients who underwent appendicec-
tomy (n = 163) compared to those who had RHC (n = 115). It was
estimated that patients who underwent appendicectomy had an
overall rate of 12.8% of LN+ but this did not appear to be clinically
relevant. As already mentioned, only two patients with tumour-
related serosal infiltration (pT4) had synchronous distant peritoneal
metastases
detected
during
initial
surgery,
treated
by
local
peritoneal excision, and a further two patients had synchronous liver
metastases not histopathologically confirmed. No patients devel-
oped clinically obvious metastases during a >10 year follow-up
period, and there were no tumour-related deaths. Based on these
findings it appears that RHC following complete resection in aNET
measuring 1–2 cm in size is not generally indicated as there appears
to be no benefit to the patients, whereas RHC could have conse-
quences, particularly in young patients. As there are currently no
similar data for aNET <1 cm in size addressing their proliferation
index, such rare cases should be discussed in a dedicated NEN multi-
disciplinary team (MDT).
6.7
|
Recommendations
1. Completion RHC is indicated in tumours >2 cm in size and in
incomplete appendicectomies (R1/R2) (Figure 2) (2b-B).
2. Completion RHC is not generally recommended in completely
resected tumours ≤2 cm in size (2b-B).
3. In resected 1–2 cm in size aNET certain risk factors, including high
grade aNET and an individual patient's expectations may justify
completion RHC. There is a lack of evidence as to whether RHC is
of any benefit in the presence of serosal perforation (5-C).

WHEN COMPLETION ONCOLOGICAL
SURGERY IS RECOMMENDED, IS RHC
ALWAYS REQUIRED OR COULD ILEOCAECAL
RESECTION BE SUFFICIENT, AND WHAT IS
THE IMPACT OF THESE PROCEDURES ON
PATIENTS' COMORBIDITIES/QOL?
The guidelines of several societies advocate oncologic RHC as
the procedure of choice in patients with aNET fulfilling histological cri-
teria for completion intestinal resection, a procedure that can be associ-
ated with short- and long-term postoperative morbidity, along with
long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impairment.3,28,36
Ileocaecal resection either as first line surgery or as completion sur-
gery has also been applied in some patients,11,36 mainly in paediatric
populations.37,38 Although the indication for ileocaecal resection instead
of RHC in aNET remains unclear, resection of the ileocaecal artery at its
origin from the superior mesenteric artery is recommended.36
Factors to consider when deciding on one of the two types of
intestinal resection, are the LN yield, short-term surgical morbidity,
and long-term outcome regarding HRQoL. Although none of these
factors has been analysed in aNET patients, the outcome of ileocaecal
resection versus RHC has been studied in patients with NET of the
terminal ileum or caecum.39 Patients who underwent RHC had more
LN evaluated versus those who had ileocaecal resection (median,
18 vs. 14, p = .004), but the oncological long-term outcome was simi-
lar. While RHC was associated with increased operation time and
intraoperative blood loss compared to ileocaecal resection (both
p < .05), there was no difference in the incidence and severity of post-
operative morbidity (both p > .05). Based on the retrospective data
available in the literature, and as no direct comparison exists between
the two procedures, a randomised controlled trial would be desirable.

Although patients with aNET who undergo RHC are young with
fewer comorbidities, present with negligible tumour load, and have
surgery in an elective setting, related complications still range from
5% to 15%.40 In the largest series on 403 aNET patients, 90-days
morbidity after completion RHC or ileocaecal resection was 15%.11
The 90-day mortality was nil. Most complications after RHC are minor
and do not require any operative intervention (Clavien Dindo grade
I and II).39,41 Those with limitations in bowel function still seem to
cope well, as their HRQoL is not severely impaired.41
A single study has particularly addressed global HRQoL using the
EORTC-QLC-C30 questionnaires in aNET patients treated either with
simple appendicectomy or RHC, also including a matched healthy con-
trol group.7 Overall, HRQoL was not significantly impaired in patients
undergoing RHC (49 patients) compared with appendicectomy alone
(30 patients). However, analyses in functional and symptom scales
revealed that impaired social functioning, diarrhoea, and financial diffi-
culties were more frequently reported in the RHC group. In addition,
diarrhoea was mainly attributed to RHC as further comparison
between the appendicectomy group and the group of healthy controls
did not yield any statistical significance on this particular outcome.7
7.1
|
Recommendations
1. Oncologic RHC is considered as a standard resection for comple-
tion surgery (3b-B).
2. As an alternative to RHC, Ileocaecal resection could be applied par-
ticularly in paediatric and young patients (4-B).
3. Both procedures are associated with low morbidity and marginal
impact on QoL (3b-B).

IS THERE ANY NEED FOR ADJUVANT
THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH ANET
WITHOUT DISTANT METASTASIS?
As noted above, G3 aNET are extremely rare, with a reported inci-
dence less than 1% in some of the largest published series5–8,10–12
(Table 3). Although these patients had undergone completion RHC,
there are no reports regarding administration of adjuvant systemic
treatment post-RHC, even in the one patient in whom recurrence was
noted 14 months later. Also, despite the presence of LN+ in
17%–30% of patients undergoing RHC, only radiological follow-up
(with cross-sectional and/or molecular imaging) with no adjuvant sys-
temic treatment had been offered in those patients.5,6,8,10–12,42
Finally, there are no data regarding the administration and outcomes
of adjuvant systemic treatment post-appendicectomy in patients
who fulfilled the criteria, but eventually declined, completion RHC.
Therefore, adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in aNET post-RHC
cannot be recommended. However, it could be considered on an indi-
vidual basis, in some extremely rare clinical scenarios, such as the
presence of LN+ in G3 aNET in the RHC specimen, following discus-
sion at a dedicated NEN MDT.
8.1
|
Recommendation
1. There is currently no need for adjuvant therapy in patients with
aNET as the vast majority are low grade tumours (5-B).

HOW SHOULD ADVANCED DISEASE BE
MANAGED?
Distant metastatic disease (DMD) in NEN originating from the small
bowel is relatively common, ranging between 40% and 50%.3 Metasta-
ses are commonly found in the liver followed by the bone in approxi-
mately 15% of cases.3 This seems to be the case for the majority of NEN
originating from the small bowel but there is a paucity of data regarding
DMD that originate from the appendix2 (Table 3). Although older series
have presented cases of aNET with DMD, these studies were hampered
by the great majority also including other NEN pathologies.3
In most of these cases treatment directed against DMD follows
the guidelines for the management of DMD issued by ENETS for
intestinal NEN.3 This view is further supported by the findings of the
Nesti et al. study where the majority of distant metastases were
attributed to a coexisting NEN, most commonly an ileal NET.19
Surgical treatment options include liver surgery and/or locoregional
and ablative therapies.3,23 A number of antiproliferative therapies
have been used in the literature in aNET patients that include long-
acting somatostatin analogues, molecular targeted therapies, peptide
receptor radionuclide therapy and chemotherapy.3,7,12,23 Choosing
the most appropriate therapy depends on tumour characteristics
(grade and tumour growth) and overall disease burden, along with the
functional status of the tumour and the patient's performance status.3

Recommendation
1. Management of the rare cases of metastatic aNET should be simi-
lar to that of other gastrointestinal NET considering that in a signif-
icant proportion these could be related to a coexisting ileal
NET (4-B).

WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED
FOLLOW-UP PROTOCOL AFTER RHC IN
PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT LN+ ? HOW
IS FOLLOW-UP IN ANET JUSTIFIED?
There is a relatively paucity of data regarding specific follow-up proto-
cols in patients with aNET after RHC according to the presence of LN
+ or not. Patients with aNET without LN+ after RHC are generally
considered “cured” and do not require further follow-up.2,3 However,
even in these cases follow-up could be considered in the presence of
tumour size >2 cm, and high G2 and G3 tumours due to the potential
risk of late recurrences following discussion in a dedicated NEN
MDT.6,11 Such an approach has not been substantiated in all recent
KALTSAS ET AL.

studies although most have a relatively short follow-up period,5–8,10–13
except in one study that had a follow-up period >10 years.19 In the latter
study no recurrences were noted, but further studies are needed to
demonstrate whether such patients need regular follow-up, and also the
precise means and intensity of follow-up.
Patients with aNET who have LN+ following RHC, without evi-
dence of DMD, have traditionally been kept under surveillance with
several of the recent studies having implemented a follow-up protocol
similar to that used for small bowel NET.5–7,12 Both morphological
and functional imaging modalities, preferably with 68Ga-DOTA-SSRT-
PET/CT, have been utilised, albeit with different intervals and variable
length of follow-up, compared to small bowel NET protocols.5–7,12 It
should be stressed though that recent retrospective studies have not
found an impact of LN+ on local recurrences, subsequent DMD
and/or OS.5–7,11,12,19
Two recent studies that have followed up patients with LN+ post-
RHC similar to small bowel NET with CT/MRI imaging and SRI, includ-
ing 68Ga-DOTA-SSTRT-PET-CT, every 6–12 months, did not find any
evidence of recurrence and/or distant metastases during a follow-up
period of 38.5 and 66 months, respectively.5,12 However, no specific
duration and intensity of follow-up have been proposed.5,6,12 It could
thus be speculated that patients exhibiting “high risk” factors such as
tumour size >2 cm and high grade G2 and G3 aNET could constitute a
group requiring consideration of follow-up. Older studies in patients
with aNET >2 cm who had not undergone a RHC and were followed
up for a significant period of time (although without using the currently
available follow-up means), showed no recurrence or evolution to met-
astatic disease.43 Similarly, although no specific follow-up modalities
were mentioned in the Nesti et al. study, no recurrences, distant
metastases or deaths were described in aNET 1–2 cm in size with LN
+ after >10-year follow-up period.19 The duration and intensity of any
follow-up should also take into consideration the natural history of the
disease and the potential sequelae of radiation exposure as the major-
ity of patients with aNET are of young age.
There are no data regarding the role of CgA in the post RHC
follow-up, due to its limited applicability as a follow-up marker after
apparently curative surgery.24 Measurement of urinary or plasma
5-HIAA levels is also of little value in detecting local recurrences, with
the exception of the rare cases of metastatic serotonin-secreting
tumours (recognising these may be related to a coexisting small
bowel NET).3,19 Evolving biomarkers such as circulating tumour cells
(CTCs) or the NETest have not extensively been studied to show
whether can be predictive of relapse during follow-up, or are not yet
readily available or fully validated respectively.44 Data regarding the
safe time for discharge are absent.

Recommendations
1. Patients without LN+ post-RHC could be considered “cured”
necessitating no further follow-up (3b-B). In the presence of “high
risk” factors such as tumour size >2 cm and high G2 and G3 aNET
the necessity of follow-up studies could be discussed in a dedi-
cated NEN MDT (Figure 3) (4-C).
2. Patients with LN+ post-RHC if associated with “high-risk” factors
could be considered as candidates for follow-up (4-C). The specific
protocol, frequency and duration of follow-up need to be precisely
defined and include morphological imaging (CT/MRI) and func-
tional imaging preferably with 68Ga-DOTA-SSTR-PET/CT in the
presence of positive findings on CT/MRI (5-B).
3. There are no established biochemical and/or molecular biomarkers
that could be used for the follow-up of patients with LN+ (4-C).
Conventional markers such as CgA and 5-HIAA can be utilised in
the rare cases of distant metastases and/or the presence of the
carcinoid syndrome (4-B).

histopathological factors to eliminate any residual disease and avoid
the risk of late recurrence. Current evidence suggests that additional
surgery should probably be offered to fewer patients than previously
advocated, based on the presence of such potential “high risk” factors
that were merely addressing the presence of LN+. Several large-scale
retrospective studies including the retrospective Europe-wide pooled
cohort study on aNET 1–2 cm in size have provided evidence that, in
contrast to other NET, LN+ in patients with aNET is not associated
with increased risk of recurrence, the development of distant metasta-
ses and/or increased death rate. The most robust criterion favoring
RHC to avoid any metastatic potential appears to be tumour size
>2 cm. Additional criteria include incomplete tumour resection and
high grade aNET, albeit without a specific Ki-67 cut-off value been
defined probably due to the small number of high-grade aNET. These
recommendations aim to reduce the number of RHC performed, par-
ticularly in young patients with potential sequalae along with their
implications on follow-up. However, there are still some areas of
uncertainty regarding the need and follow-up means and its duration
in patients undergoing RHC along with the specific genetic signature
of aNET that is related to their more indolent course. We hope that
these recommendations will facilitate a more standardised care for
aNET patients by better identifying patients who will benefit from
additional surgery, avoiding unnecessary RHC.
