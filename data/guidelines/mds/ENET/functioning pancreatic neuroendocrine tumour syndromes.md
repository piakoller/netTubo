INTRODUCTION
Background
This European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society (ENETS) guidance paper
aims to provide practical guidance to clinicians for the diagnosis, treat-
ment and follow-up of functioning syndromes in pancreatic neuroendo-
crine tumours (Pan-NET). Evidence and guidance are presented in the
context of nine dedicated clinical questions (Table 1). The paper pro-
vides an update from the previous ENETS guidelines on Pan-NET with
hormonal excess1,2 with an emphasis on new developments and con-
troversial areas. We focus on management of the hormonal syndromes
in well-differentiated, grade 1–3, functioning NET with the primary
tumour originating in the pancreas, and for specific subtypes also in the
duodenum. The reader is referred to the ENETS 2023 guidance papers
on non-functioning (NF-)Pan-NET and gastroduodenal NET for primary
oncological treatment of pancreatic or duodenal NET, whereas manage-
ment of poorly differentiated counterparts is discussed in the ENETS
2023 guidance paper for digestive NEC.3 All recommendations in this
guidance paper are graded according to the level of evidence (1–5) and
strength of recommendation (A–D) (Table 2).
Definitions
A functioning NET syndrome is defined by the presence of a clinical
syndrome combined with biochemical evidence of inappropriately ele-
vated hormonal levels. Some NET may secrete biologically inactive hor-
monal variants or bioactive hormones at insufficient levels to elicit
symptoms, and these should consequently be classified as non-
functioning. Likewise, positive hormonal expression in NET cells on
immunohistochemical staining is insufficient for the diagnosis of a func-
tioning NET syndrome. Due to the tissue-specific localisation of neuro-
endocrine
cell
subtypes
along
the
alimentary
tract,
the
pancreaticoduodenal region gives rises to specific functioning NET syn-
dromes. Some of these syndromes are well characterised, while others
are extremely uncommon and remain poorly described (Table 3).
Although rare, Pan-NET can simultaneously lead to the combined
presence of more than one functioning syndrome in a patient, by secre-
tion of multiple bioactive hormones. Metachronous functioning syn-
dromes marked by the development of a new functioning syndrome can
occur in up to 3%–6% of Pan-NET patients during the course of the dis-
ease, particularly when the tumour progresses.4,5 The molecular basis
(i.e., genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic) underlying Pan-NET oncogen-
esis and tumour development have been systematically studied in recent
years. However, the clinical impact of this work remains limited, with
many studies requiring further validation.
Q1: How should we define and characterise an insulinoma and
differentiate this from other causes of hypoglycaemia?
Clinical history
A careful history in a non-diabetic patient with a history of hypo-
glycaemia should start from a well-documented Whipple's triad6 [3,
A], which consists of:

• Symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.
• Documentation of a low glucose concentration.
• Relief of the symptoms after ingestion of carbohydrates.
Symptoms of hypoglycaemia include those of the autonomous
nervous system, such as sweating, weakness, tachycardia and hunger,
as well as those of neuroglycopenia, including irritability, cognitive
deficits, transient focal neurological deficits, seizures and coma.7 Since
these symptoms lack specificity, the average time until biochemical
evaluation
and
diagnosis
of
endogenous
hyperinsulinaemic
hypoglycaemia (EHH) is at least 2 years, often up to 5 years or even
longer.8 Very often during this period of time the various symptoms
of the autonomic nervous system may vanish due to hypoglycaemic
unawareness.9 Importantly, these symptoms have to be related
to documented low blood glucose levels (at least <2.5 mmol/L or
45 mg/dL) to qualify for further biochemical evaluation [3, A].
An additional helpful detail of history is the significant increase in
weight over the last years in more than 50% of the patients.7 Finally, the
timing of the symptoms is of utmost importance (fasting – during the night
or postprandial) as well as the medication taken by the patient and by fam-
ily members (i.e., risk of hypoglycaemia factitia), a familial or personal his-
tory of autoimmune diseases, and previous bariatric surgery6 [5, B].
Biochemical assessment
The presence of a hypoglycaemic disorder in a patient without diabe-
tes should be confirmed using a collection tube that contains an inhib-
itor of glycolysis, and processing should not be delayed. Importantly,
low blood glucose values using reflectance metres are not sufficiently
reliable in the low blood glucose range [4, B]. To date, data are insuffi-
cient as to whether a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS)
has sufficient sensitivity and specificity as a screening tool to confirm
or rule out significant hypoglycaemia.10
In a patient with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia and
documented spontaneous hypoglycaemia <2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL)
additional biochemical assessment including insulin, C-peptide and, if
possible, pro-insulin and β-hydroxy-butyrate (BHOB) should be per-
formed at the time of hypoglycaemia. In cases of suspected factitious
hypoglycaemia, assessment of oral hypoglycaemic agents (sulphony-
lurea and meglitinides) is recommended. If values are consistent with
EHH, no further provocative testing is necessary6 [3, A].
In an asymptomatic patient, hypoglycaemia counterregulatory
hormones (cortisol, growth hormone) should be evaluated and the
autoimmune insulin antibody11 or insulin receptor antibody syn-
drome12 should be excluded in suspected cases, although these latter
syndromes are very rare. Once deficiency of counterregulatory hor-
mones and insulin autoimmune syndrome are excluded, provocative
testing is indicated: in cases of fasting hypoglycaemia, the 72 h fasting
test is recommended; in cases of postprandial symptomatic patients, a
mixed meal-test is required6 [3, A], Figure 1.
Fasting test
This test should be performed as an in-patient on a dedicated endo-
crine ward. A meticulous protocol is needed, with correct labelling of
tubes, noting time points of blood sampling and documenting patients'
symptoms, in particular neuroglycopenic ones. Blood samples for the
above-mentioned parameters are repeatedly assessed during the fast
until symptomatic hypoglycaemia occurs associated with a glucose
level usually <2.5 mmol/L (45 mg/dL). To assess subtle cognitive dys-
function (neuroglycopenia) repetitive testing using the mini-mental
test has been shown to be useful.13

Based on the available literature a maximum of 72 h fasting is recom-
mended to firmly exclude EHH. Previous data suggest that significant
hypoglycaemia occurs after 12 h of fasting in approximately 40%, after
24 h in 67% and after 48 h in 95% of cases8 [3, A]. Some authors suggest
the administration of 1 mg glucagon intravenously at the end of the fasting
test, with glucose measured at 10, 20 and 30 min after injection. This has
the advantage of treating the hypoglycaemia and at the same time confirm-
ing the EHH diagnosis; see below for interpretation of the data [3, C].
Mixed meal test
We propose a standardised non-liquid meal (typically breakfast) that is –
on the history – associated with hypoglycaemic symptoms. Samples are
collected for analysis of plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide and pro-
insulin, measured at baseline and then every 30 min until symptomatic
hypoglycaemia occurs or maximally for 5 h.14 Before administering car-
bohydrates, a last blood sample for the analysis of the above-mentioned
parameters and, if not yet performed, for insulin antibodies and oral
hypoglycaemic agents is collected. Of note, approximately 5% of patients
with insulinomas will show post-prandial but not fasting hypoglycaemia.
Interpretation of the laboratory results
The differential diagnosis of non-diabetic hypoglycaemic disorders includes
EHH with the underlying diagnosis of insulinoma, non-insulinoma pancrea-
togenous hypoglycaemia syndrome (NIPHS) due to islet hypertrophy, insu-
linomatosis and nesidioblastosis versus exogenous administration of
insulin secretagogues or insulin as well as the insulin antibody syndrome.14
Clinical and biochemical characteristics are summarised in Figure 1.
Insulin and C-peptide values have to be interpreted in relation to
the glucose level at the same time point and NOT in relation to the
normal range as indicated by the hospital laboratory [3, A]. We recom-
mend that a nomogram should be used as suggested by Service14 for
the interpretation of data related to glucose, insulin, C-peptide, pro-
insulin and BHOB (Table 4).
Recommendations:
• Fasting hypoglycaemia in a non-diabetic patient requires
documentation of Whipple's triad, which, if positive,
should be followed by a fasting test [5, A].
• Endogenous hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia should be
excluded in the presence of a neurological symptom
without clear diagnosis [5, B].
• The proof of inappropiate insulin and C-peptide levels in
relation to hypoglycaemia is critical for the diagnosis and
can be obtained in an emergency situation or during a
provocative fasting test [3, A].
Q2: Which biochemical tests should be performed in patients
with clinical suspicion of gastrinoma?
The diagnosis of gastrinoma, responsible for the Zollinger-Ellison syn-
drome (ZES), should be suspected in a patient with clinical symptoms of
acid hypersecretion: peptic ulcer disease (PUD), severe gastroesophageal
reflux disease (GERD) and/or diarrhoea that is responsive to proton pump
inhibitors (PPI).15 However, due to early prescription of PPI, symptoms
are often less pronounced than in the past, especially for complicated
PUD, and only a minority of patients will present with multiple ulcers.
PUD without Helicobacter pylori infection, use of non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Crohn's disease or malignancy or with a his-
tory of multiple, recurrent, refractory ulcers or ulcers on atypical locations
should raise suspicion of gastrinoma. The classic diagnosis of gastrinoma
requires the demonstration of 10x elevated fasting serum gastrin (FSG)
levels in combination with the presence of a gastric fluid pH ≤2 [3, B].16
Demonstration of gastric acid hypersecretion by means of gastric fluid pH
evaluation can be obtained through nasogastric tube or oesophagogastro-
duodenoscopy (OGD) using electrode, filter paper or biochemical evalua-
tion of aspirate. Both diagnostic criteria are fundamental because the
differential diagnosis of hypergastrinaemia includes more common causes
of achlorhydria or hypochlorhydria states, such as chronic atrophic gastri-
tis, PPI therapy, renal failure, and Helicobacter pylori infection. Other rare
causes of elevated FSG levels, such as gastric outlet obstruction, short
bowel syndrome, retained gastric antrum syndrome and juvenile gastric
polyposis, can be excluded by history taking or OGD.
The diagnosis of gastrinoma syndrome is complicated due to
intermediate FSG levels and widespread PPI use. Elevated FSG levels
up to 10 times the upper reference level of normal without the use of
PPIs can be observed in a substantial subset of patients with a gastri-
noma. The secretin stimulation test and measurement of the gastric
basal acid output have been requested in former times for the diagno-
sis of gastrinoma, but these tests have disappeared from clinical prac-
tice.17 To complicate the diagnosis further, patients presenting with
PUD or GERD will often be on PPI treatment before specialist referral,
causing elevations of gastrin levels that overlap with that of the gastri-
noma syndrome.18 PPI withdrawal in gastrinoma patients is at risk of
inducing rebound acid hypersecretion and exacerbating acid-related
symptoms, potentially causing ulcers, bleeding, or perforation. There-
fore, caution should be applied when attempting temporary PPI with-
drawal in cases of suspected gastrinoma, and published protocols
from expert centres should be followed.16,19 [5, C].
Given the above-mentioned problems in the classic diagnosis of gas-
trinoma20 and the advent of highly sensitive imaging techniques, we pro-
pose an alternative diagnostic algorithm for gastrinoma, which reflects
contemporary clinical practice in most expert centres. In patients with
suggestive symptoms of PUD, GERD and/or PPI-responsive diarrhoea in
combination with elevated FSG levels, in the absence of alternative diag-
noses of elevated FSG levels (see above), a diagnostic work-up including
OGD with endoscopic EUS, CT/MRI and somatostatin receptor imaging
is advised [5, C]. On OGD, the detection of prominent gastric folds and a
gastric pH ≤2 can be supportive for the diagnosis, while alternative diag-
noses for symptoms and/or hypergastrinaemia can be ruled out. In cases

of detection of a duodenopancreatic (dp) lesion, biopsy or EUS-guided
fine needle aspiration (FNA) with gastrin staining of the aspirate is only
advised in lesions of unclear aetiology or cases with multiple endocrine
neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), or metastatic spread on imaging. If a dp-NET is
detected on imaging in the presence of evident symptoms and elevated
FSG levels, the alternative diagnosis of gastrinoma can be made. PPI
should be initiated or intensified and depending on the disease stage, sur-
gical or medical management should be started (Figure 2, Q7–Q8). The
possibility of falsely elevated FSG levels, particularly in those patients
using PPI, should be strongly considered in cases with negative imaging
on endoscopic EUS, CT/MRI and somatostatin receptor PET [5, D].
Recommendations:
• The presence of a gastrinoma should be evaluated in
Pan-NET
patients
with
PUD,
GERD
and/or
PPI-
responsive diarrhoea [5, A].
• The diagnosis of gastrinoma is established by the combina-
tion of symptoms, a FSG level >10x URL and a gastric fluid
pH ≤2, in the absence of PPI use [3, A]. An alternative
diagnosis of gastrinoma can be made by combining symp-
toms and elevated FSG levels with the presence of a dp-
NET with gastrin expression on immunohistochemistry or
positive uptake on somatostatin receptor imaging [5, D].
Q3: Which biochemical test should be performed to diagnose rare
functioning syndromes (glucagonoma, VIPoma, ACTHoma, carcinoid
syndrome, PTHrPoma, calcitoninoma, GHRHoma, somatostatinoma)
in patients?
Besides insulinoma and gastrinoma, several rare functioning syn-
dromes can be encountered in Pan-NET patients and should be inves-
tigated only if clinical suspicion arises (Table 3). Several of these
syndromes are characterised by increased levels of peptide hormones,
which physiologically respond to oral intake of nutrients. Conse-
quently, circulating levels of these hormones should be investigated in
the fasting state to diagnose these rare functioning syndromes.
The diagnosis of a glucagonoma is made by the combination of char-
acteristic clinical features, particularly necrolytic migratory erythema of
the skin, and elevated fasting serum glucagon levels. Normal fasting gluca-
gon levels vary between 50 and 150 pg/mL, while diseases including dia-
betes, sepsis, pancreatitis, trauma, Cushing's syndrome and renal or liver
insufficiency can stimulate circulating glucagon levels up to 500 pg/mL. A
fasting plasma glucagon above 500 pg/mL and particularly above
1000 pg/mL supports the diagnosis of glucagonoma syndrome21,22 [3, B].
When a vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-producing NET or
VIPoma is suspected, a fasting VIP level should be collected. Due to
VIP's short half-life, a protease inhibitor like aprotinin should be added
to the collecting tube. VIP levels in healthy subjects are below
20 pmol/L (70 pg/mL), whereas a VIP level above 60 nmol/L (203 pg/
mL) is considered diagnostic for VIPoma23 [3, B]. A review of

52 VIPoma patients reported markedly elevated VIP levels, with a
median of 188 pmol/L (range 30–2131 pmol/L)24 [3, B]. Sampling dur-
ing an asymptomatic period may lead to false negative results due to
fluctuating VIP levels and should lead to re-measurement during a
period of diarrhoea. Differential diagnosis of slightly elevated VIP
levels includes renal insufficiency and congestive heart failure.
The reader is referred to dedicated guidelines for the diagnosis of
Cushing's syndrome due to ectopic adrenocorticotrophic hormone
(ACTH)25 and carcinoid syndrome.26 Although elevated urinary 5-HIAA
levels can be detected in up to 10% of advanced Pan-NET patients, the
presence of a carcinoid syndrome is exceptional, at 1% in one series.27
Hypercalcaemia in a Pan-NET patient should raise suspicion of
primary hyperparathyroidism, which is a key feature of MEN1. How-
ever, in the absence of elevated PTH levels and bone metastases,
humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy due to ectopic PTHrP secre-
tion should be investigated by PTHrP measurement [4, B].
The presence of watery diarrhoea has also been associated with
calcitonin secretion from Pan-NET, in the absence of concomitant
medullary thyroid carcinoma. In a literature review of 37 calcitonin-
secreting Pan-NET cases, circulating calcitonin concentrations were
on average almost 90-fold the upper limit of normal28 [4, D].
Suspicion of acromegaly in a Pan-NET patient can be confirmed
by screening serum insulin-like factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, which are
2.6–2.8 times the upper limit of normal in patients with ectopic GHRH
secretion from a NET.29 Moderate hyperprolactinaemia may also be
present. Following the detection of elevated IGF-1 levels, GHRH
levels should be assessed, after the addition of a protease inhibitor.
GHRH levels are undetectable in healthy subjects (< 30 ng/L),
whereas concentrations above 250 ng/L are diagnostic for ectopic
GHRH secretion30 [4, C]. Differential diagnosis of a GH-secreting
pituitary tumour should be considered, particularly in MEN1 patients.
A somatostatinoma leading to a clinical syndrome including
gallstones, diabetes mellitus and diarrhoea/steatorrhoea has been
described for pancreatic, duodenal and jejunal NET.31 Many pub-
lished case reports concern NET with positive immunohistochemi-
cal expression of somatostatin rather than a functioning syndrome
of multihormonal inhibitory symptoms, which has questioned the
existence of a true clinical somatostatinoma syndrome.32 Also, the
cutoff of fasting plasma somatostatin levels for the diagnosis of
somatostatinoma syndrome has not been clearly established or vali-
dated. Reports have suggested employing cutoffs of circulating
somatostatin levels above two to three times the upper reference
limit,
but
functioning
syndromes
have
predominantly
been
described in patients with pancreatic primaries and highly elevated
somatostatin levels [4, D]. Consequently, the WHO classification
now states that NEN with somatostatin-positive immunohistochem-
istry but without symptoms of somatostatinoma syndrome should
be designated as somatostatin-producing well-differentiated NEN
and are not considered somatostatinomas.33
Recommendations:
• History taking of all Pan-NET patients should include
signs and symptoms of insulinoma, gastrinoma and rare
functioning syndromes [5, A].
• Biochemical tests for rare functioning syndromes should only
be performed in patients with specific signs or symptoms.
Blood samples should be taken according to precise protocols
and results interpreted in relation to specific cutoffs [5, A].

Q4: Which patients with functioning pancreatic NET syndromes
should be referred for genetic counselling?
Pan-NET are inherited in approximately 17% of cases and can pre-
sent in the context of monogenic familial endocrine tumour syn-
dromes34 [2, A]. Generally, the hallmarks of these conditions include
multiple primary tumours in multiple organs, early onset (< 40 years)
and characteristic inheritance patterns and should prompt clinicians to
search for other non-Pan-NET signs of hereditary syndromes. There-
fore, it is crucial to take a detailed medical and personal family history
in every patient presenting with a functioning Pan-NET. The syndromes
associated with Pan-NET include MEN1, multiple endocrine neoplasia
type 4 (MEN4), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and tuberous sclerosis
(TSC) 1 and 2, see Table 5. Pan-NET also occur in up to 10% of patients
with Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease and in 100% of Mahvash disease,
but these tumours are not associated with clinical functioning syn-
dromes.35,36 The genetic syndromes associated with functioning Pan-
NET are usually highly penetrant with variable expressivity. All are auto-
somal dominant (AD) conditions. Patients with functioning Pan-NET
and a history and/or symptoms of any of the associated syndromes
should be referred to a clinical geneticist for evaluation.
MEN1/MEN4
Multiple Pan-NET are typical in MEN1, a rare AD highly penetrant
tumour syndrome caused by heterozygous damaging variants in the
MEN1 gene. MEN1-related phenotype is characterised by primary
hyperparathyroidism, anterior pituitary tumours, Pan-NET, lung and
thymic NET, adrenocortical tumours, breast cancer and dermatological
signs (angiofibroma, lipoma, collagenoma), respectively. Pan-NET can be
detected in up to 80% of MEN1 patients with a cumulative incidence
increasing with age.37 Most Pan-NET are non-functioning. Functioning
Pan-NET within the spectrum of MEN1 include insulinoma (10%), glu-
cagonoma (<1%), somatostatinoma (1%), and VIPoma (<1%). The vast
majority of MEN1-associated gastrinomas are found in the duodenum.
Suspicion of MEN1 should be considered in patients with typical MEN1
features and young age of onset (<30 years)38 [2, A].
The diagnosis of MEN1 requires the presence of at least two of the
three endocrine tumours or a damaging alteration of the MEN1 gene. In
familial cases with phenotypic MEN1 but with no MEN1 damaging vari-
ants, MEN4 should be suspected. This is a very rare AD multiendocrine
tumour predisposing syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in the
CDKN1B gene, encoding for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b, p27.
It is characterised by primary hyperparathyroidism, pituitary and gastro-
enteropancreatic NENs, including dp-NET. Among the nine dp-NET
cases described so far, most were NF-Pan-NET and the remaining three
were duodenal gastrinomas39 [4, D].
Neurofibromatosis type 1
Insulinoma and somatostatinoma rarely occur in NF1, with eight descrip-
tions to date.40 NF1 is an AD full penetrant neurocutaneous disease,
which is caused by an inactivating germline alteration of the NF1 gene
on chromosome 17q11.2 [2, A]. Mutations arise de novo in about 50%
of patients. NF1-related phenotype is characterised by multiple café-au-
lait spots, axillary freckling, cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas,
bilateral Lisch nodules, optic gliomas, bony alterations, and neurofi-
bromas. Functioning Pan-NET are rare in NF1. In patients with pancre-
atic insulinoma or somatostatinoma, NF1 can be suspected if they also
present at least two typical clinical features of the disease or one clinical
feature and at least one a first-degree relative with NF141 [2, A].
Tuberous Sclerosis Complex
Pan-NET are an uncommon finding in TSC, but their frequency is
higher in these patients than in general population. TSC, a tumour pre-
disposing syndrome characterised by the development of hamarto-
mas, benign tumours, and, rarely, malignant tumours, is caused by a
germline damaging variants in TSC1 or TSC2 genes. In the minority of
TSC-associated Pan-NET that are accompanied by a hormonal syn-
drome, insulinoma was the predominant type42 [4, D].
Monogenic Pan-NET molecular analysis
Damaging alterations in all discussed genes can be nucleotide substitu-
tions, small nucleotide deletion/insertion, and, although less frequently,
also gross exonic and multiexonic rearrangements. Thus, molecular test-
ing for MEN1, MEN4, NF1 and TSC should include sequencing analysis
(preferably next-generation sequencing) followed by a quantitative
assay (such as multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification).

Recommendations:
• History taking in patients with a functioning Pan-NET syn-
drome should include the presence of hereditary endocrine
disease in patients as well as in family members [5, A].
• Patients with functioning Pan-NET and a family history
and/or symptoms of any of the associated syndromes
should be referred to a clinical geneticist for evaluation
[2, A].
Q5:
What
is
the
difference
in
the
imaging
work-up
of
functioning Pan-NET as compared to non-functioning Pan-NET?
Cross-sectional imaging and EUS
The diagnostic work-up of a functioning Pan-NET is not significantly
different as compared to that of a NF-Pan-NET, with the exception of
insulinoma43 [4, B]. The principal challenge lies in the localisation of the
functioning NET. Functioning Pan-NET are generally imaged earlier in
the disease stage compared to their non-functioning counterparts.
Lesions are therefore smaller, with a typical pattern of NET. Multiphasic
contrast-enhanced CT imaging including early arterial phase is required
to depict and characterise these typically small hypervascularised
lesions. The sensitivity of CT for the detection of small functioning
tumours is high during the arterial phase (83%–88%) and is lower dur-
ing the portal venous phase (11%–76%).44 On CT, insulinomas and gas-
trinomas are often small rounded lesions with marked homogeneous
hyperenhancement in the arterial phase, without stenosis of the main
pancreatic duct.45 Gastrinomas are mainly located in the gastrinoma tri-
angle, either in the pancreas parenchyma or in the duodenum. Every
enhancing nodule must be reported as they could be a functioning
lesion. On the contrary, insulinomas are generally solitary. The sensitiv-
ity of thin-section arterial phase CT for their detection is 94%; the over-
all diagnostic sensitivity for combined biphasic thin-section helical CT
and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been reported to be 100%.46 One
infrequent but specific lesion is the somatostatinoma of Vater's
ampulla, associated with NF1, appearing as a nodular lesion of Vater's
ampulla.47 With MRI, Pan-NETs are usually positive on diffusion-
weighted imaging, hypointense on T1 and moderately hyperintense on
T2. EUS shows a high sensitivity of roughly 87%, a specificity of 98%,
and allows FNA biopsy/cytology, also for immunohistochemical staining
of hormones for culprit lesions.48 EUS can detect lesions as small as 2–
5 mm. Importantly, functional activity of subcentimetre lesions is
exceedingly rare outside of insulinoma or gastrinoma. However, lesions
located in the pancreatic tail may be overlooked by EUS, which is oper-
ator dependent. EUS and MRCP can provide the distance of the Pan-
NET to the main pancreatic duct, which is crucial information for the
possibility of performing an enucleation [3, A].
Functional imaging
Somatostatin receptor targeting radioligands such as 68Ga-DOTA-SSA
or 64Cu-DOTA-SSA have high sensitivity but have a limited role in dif-
ferentiating between functioning and NF-Pan-NET. Glucagon-like
peptide-1 receptors (GLP-1R) are overexpressed in 93% of localised
insulinomas.49 Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of
GLP-1R PET/CT or PET/MRI for the detection of insulinoma as well
as nesidioblastosis foci in comparison to contrast-enhanced CT, MRI
and somatostatin receptor imaging50 [3, B]. On the other hand, GLP-
1R is overexpressed only in 36% of patients with metastatic insuli-
noma, making GLP-1R PET less sensitive for diagnosing these malig-
nant lesions. In the absence of GLP-1R imaging, 68Ga-DOTA-SSA or
18F-DOPA PET can be used, although 68Ga-DOTA-SSA is superior to
18F-DOPA51,52 [3, B].
Venous sampling
In rare cases of biochemical diagnosis of insulinoma and negative
(functional) imaging arterial calcium stimulation with hepatic venous
sampling can help to localise the insulinoma. In a meta-analysis
of 10 studies with 337 patients, the sensitivity and specificity of
calcium-stimulated venous insulin sampling were 93% and 86%,
respectively.53 It has to be mentioned that as a result of the calcium
stimulation test only the territory of the corresponding artery can be
defined, not necessarily the tumour itself. These investigations should
be confined to expert centres [4, B].
Recommendations:
• Similar to NF-Pan-NET, imaging of patients with func-
tioning
Pan-NET
syndromes
should
include
cross-
sectional imaging with CT or MRI and 68Ga-DOTA-SSA
or 64Cu-DOTA-SSA PET/CT [4, B].
• EUS can be helpful for the detection of small insulinomas
and gastrinomas as well as to define the tumour location
in relation to the pancreatic duct, if minimally invasive
enucleation is considered [3, A].
• GLP-1R PET/CT or calcium-stimulated sampling are advised
in cases of insulinoma with negative imaging [4, B].
Q6: What is the appropriate surgical management of localised
insulinoma?
Locoregional therapy of localised insulinoma comprises differ-
ent management approaches, ranging from surgery to endoscopy
and interventional radiology. The treatment of localised insulinoma
differs from that of localised NF-Pan-NET, mainly due to a more
benign biological behaviour and consequently a lower risk of nodal

and distant metastases. As distinct from asymptomatic patients
with NF-Pan-NET ≤2 cm, active surveillance is not appropriate for
patients with insulinomas due to the presence of functioning
symptoms.
Surgical approach
Surgical resection is the gold standard treatment for localised
insulinomas. Parenchyma-sparing pancreatic resections should be
proposed as first-line surgical strategy, when technically feasi-
ble54 [2b, A]. Since the risk of nodal metastases is low, a formal
lymphadenectomy is not routinely required [2b, A]. Nodal sam-
pling might be performed in order to decrease the risk of tumour
understaging55 [2b, B]. Tumour size, location, and relationship
with the main pancreatic duct (MPD) should guide the surgical
decision-making in patients with benign insulinomas. Enucleation
can be proposed to patients with insulinomas smaller than 2–
3 cm and located at ≥3 mm from the MPD56 [2b, A]. Central pan-
createctomy represents a valuable option for patients with insuli-
nomas located in the pancreatic neck, when enucleation is not
feasible, and the remaining parenchyma is enough to guarantee a
relevant pancreatic function. The main advantage of parenchyma-
sparing over formal resections is represented by the excellent
long-term functional outcomes. On the other hand, a major chal-
lenge is still represented by the high morbidity rate, mainly
related to the risk of pancreatic fistula. Regarding the surgical
approach, several studies and meta-analyses have reported that
laparoscopic procedures are safe and effective treatment options
for
patients
with
Pan-NET,
including
insulinomas56,57
[2a,
B]. Therefore, a minimally invasive approach should be always
considered, when technically feasible, for patients with preopera-
tively localised insulinomas [2a, A]. On the other hand, open sur-
gery with intraoperative ultrasound is required when insulinomas
are not localised preoperatively.
Other approaches
Combined endoscopic and radiological management of insulino-
mas has been recently investigated. EUS-guided radiofrequency
ablation (EUS-RFA) is a novel technique able to induce necrosis
of small pancreatic lesions. EUS-RFA seems a safe and effective
treatment option for small (≤2 cm) localised insulinomas, espe-
cially in patients considered unfit for surgery. In this regard,
recent retrospective series and meta-analyses have shown a high
clinical success rate (86%–96%), reporting only minor treatment-
related adverse events58,59 [2a, C]. However, further data in
terms of long-term survival and recurrence rate are needed
before proposing this procedure routinely in patients with small
insulinomas, and these interventions should be confined to expert
centres.
Recommendations:
• Parenchyma-sparing pancreatic resections, including enucle-
ation and central pancreatectomy, should be proposed as a
first-line surgical strategy in patients with insulinoma [2b, A].
• A minimally invasive approach should be always consid-
ered, when technically feasible, for patients with preoper-
atively localised insulinomas [2a, A].
• EUS-RFA might be considered as treatment option in
patients with small (≤2 cm) localised insulinomas consid-
ered as unfit for surgery [2a, C].
Q7: What is the appropriate surgical management of localised
gastrinoma?
The treatment of localised gastrinoma causing ZES differs from
that of localised NF-Pan-NET for several reasons. First, gastrinomas
might develop either in the duodenum (60%–70%), the pancreas
(20%–30%) or potentially in the lymph nodes (about 10%–20%).60
The presence of primary lymph node gastrinomas, however, is contro-
versial, since it remains unclear whether they represent metastatic dis-
ease from a yet unidentified primary tumour or a de novo occurrence
of a primary tumour in a lymph node.61 Second, even very small
(<5 mm) gastrinomas have a high risk for nodal metastases of approxi-
mately 80%60,62,63 (EL3). Third, about 20%–30% of gastrinomas are
associated with MEN1, which arise almost exclusively in the duode-
num and are often multiple.63,64 Therefore, indication and type of sur-
gery for localised gastrinomas are more complex, with more open
questions compared to NF-Pan-NET and other functioning Pan-NET.
Surgical approach in sporadic gastrinoma
Surgical resection represents the gold standard treatment for preopera-
tively identified localised sporadic gastrinomas, either duodenal or pan-
creatic, independent of size65 [3, A]. It has been shown that patients
with sporadic ZES and negative preoperative imaging also benefit from
surgical exploration with curative intent66 [3, B]. Regardless of the type
of dp procedure, it is always mandatory to perform a systematic peri-
pancreatic lymphadenectomy during every operation for ZES, since it
has been demonstrated that nodal dissection reduces the rate of ZES
persistence and improves survival [3, A].67,68
In sporadic duodenal gastrinomas, it remains unclear whether a
duodenotomy with local excision or a partial pancreaticoduodenectomy
(PPD) is the optimal procedure to provide long-term cure. Previous ret-
rospective studies on non-metastatic sporadic gastrinomas favoured
duodenotomy with lymphadenectomy compared to PPD, since there
was no significant difference in survival outcomes but a lower compli-
cation rate after duodenotomy67,69 [3, B]. Only very few case reports

exist regarding a laparoscopic approach, and it is not recommended,
since the capability of detecting the small submucosal gastrinomas by
palpation is very limited in cases of duodenotomy [5, A].
In cases of sporadic pancreatic gastrinomas, most experts propose
formal pancreatic resections with lymphadenectomy as procedure of
choice for all pancreatic gastrinomas [5, B]. Laparoscopic/robotic pro-
cedures are safe and effective treatment options for selected patients
with preoperatively localised pancreatic gastrinoma70 [2, A].
A prospective study with long-term follow-up revealed that a sig-
nificant proportion (30%–40%) of patients with sporadic ZES will
develop resectable persistent or recurrent disease after an initial oper-
ation. These patients generally have prolonged survival after reopera-
tion and 25% of them can be cured with repeat surgery. Thus, all ZES
patients should have systematic postoperative imaging, and, if a loca-
lised visible tumour recurs, reoperation is recommended69 [2, A]. It is
advised to continue PPI therapy for at least 3–6 months after re-
section with curative intent due to the continued risk of GERD com-
plications due to the parietal cell mass.
Other approaches
In patients with increased surgical risk due to relevant comorbidities or
advanced age, medical therapy with high-dose PPI with or without SSA
(see below) can be considered to control gastrinoma symptoms and
growth [5, A]. In contrast to insulinoma and NF-Pan-NET EUS-RFA for
localised pancreatic gastrinomas has been poorly investigated with only
very few cases described.71 The success rate was limited to 50%, prob-
ably due to the high rate of nodal metastases [4, C]. Thus, this proce-
dure
is
not
recommended
for
patients
with
small
pancreatic
gastrinomas outside clinical studies. EUS-RFA should not be performed
in duodenal gastrinomas because of the risk of perforation [5, A].
MEN1-associated gastrinoma
The indication and the timing of surgery in MEN1-ZES are controver-
sial, since it has been shown that patients with no imageable pancre-
atic tumour, who did not undergo surgery, have a good prognosis
with 5-year survival rates around 90% and a 10 year survival rate of
54% in cases of disseminated distant metastases72 [3]. One has to
keep in mind that patients with MEN1-ZES always have small duode-
nal gastrinomas and almost never pancreatic gastrinomas, as demon-
strated by pathological studies60 [2, A]. In addition, up to 85% of
MEN1 gastrinomas are metastatic at the time of diagnosis, as shown
by the presence of nodal and/or liver metastases, although the pri-
mary tumours might be microgastrinomas as small as 1 to 2 mm60,62
[2]. The presence of an imageable pancreatic lesion >20 mm in
MEN1-ZES, although most likely not representing the functioning cul-
prit lesion, may still be a useful surrogate parameter to indicate sur-
gery, based on the good long-term survival in this setting of up to
100% at 10 years64,65,72 [2b, A]. Some groups, however, favour sur-
gery at the time of biochemical evidence of ZES, since this approach
provided long-term cure rates of 60%–80% in a small case series63,73
[3, B]. Finally, the ameliorating effect of parathyroidectomy should be
considered in coincident cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, as cal-
cium stimulates gastrin release.
The optimal surgical procedure is also controversial. Surgical
strategies comprise local excision via duodenotomy with or without
distal pancreatic resection, dependent on the presence of NF-Pan-
NET, regional lymphadenectomy, as well as PPD. At present, the most
common procedure for MEN1-related ZES is duodenotomy with exci-
sion of duodenal wall tumours, enucleation of pancreatic head lesions,
systematic lymphadenectomy with or without distal pancreatectomy
according to the presence of other Pan-NET in the pancreatic body/
tail38,69 [3]. These procedures provide a biochemical cure of only 30%
FIGURE 3

functioning syndromes includes a multimodal approach. First-line treatment should be initiated in all patients with symptoms and advanced
disease as monotherapy or combination treatment. In case of refractory symptoms further lines of treatment should be explored until clinical
benefit, also taking into account the need for antiproliferative control or cytoreduction based on tumour growth rate and bulk. *Almost all cases
of gastrinoma can be clinically controlled with high dose PPI. **In aggressive cases bilateral adrenalectomy should be considered the first-line
option of choice. PPI, proton-pump inhibitor; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; SSA, somatostatin analogues.

of cases after 5 years69,73–75 [3] compared to PPD resections with a
chance of biochemical cure of 60%–80% after 10 years63,73 [3,
A]. One major argument against PPD is represented by the potential
perioperative and long-term morbidity [3]. However, recent retro-
spective cohort studies have shown that neither perioperative and
long-term complications nor the quality of life are significantly differ-
ent between patients undergoing PPD resections and non-PPD resec-
tions, if surgery is performed in an expert centre73,76 [3]. At present,
the timing and type of surgery for MEN1-related ZES should be indi-
vidualised according to patient's characteristics (e.g., age, comorbid-
ities, pre-existing insulin-dependent diabetes) and preferences.
Based on the very limited data, it is recommended that the indica-
tion for re-exploration in MEN1-related ZES should be considered
with caution, especially because the symptoms can be well controlled
with medical treatment and long-term survival in the absence of dis-
tant metastases is excellent. The eventual surgical procedure should
be individualised according to preoperative findings, previous duode-
nopancreatic resections, the patient's history (e.g., age, pre-existing
insulin-dependent diabetes), and preference77,78 [3, A].
Recommendations:
• The treatment of choice for sporadic gastrinoma without
disseminated disease is resection of the primary with sys-
tematic lymphadenectomy [3, A].
• Any operation for sporadic or MEN1-associated duode-
nal ZES should include an exploration of the duodenum
via duodenotomy with excision of duodenal or even re-
section of the duodenum combined with systematic lym-
phadenectomy
to
provide
a
chance
to
cure
hypergastrinemia and to reduce the risk of distant meta-
static disease [2b, A].
• The higher chance of cure when performing a pancreatico-
duodenectomy resection in MEN1-ZES should be discussed
with the patient in terms of benefits and risks [3, A].
Q8: What is the appropriate management of patients with
advanced disease and functioning pancreatic NET syndromes?
The management of functioning Pan-NET syndromes in patients
with advanced disease, that is, unresectable or metastatic, requires a
multimodal approach consisting of supportive, medical, interventional
and surgical treatment. For patients awaiting potentially curative re-
section of their Pan-NET some of these strategies can also be employed
until the date of surgery (Figure 3). This section focuses primarily on the
management of the hormonal symptoms in patients with advanced Pan-
NET, whereas the oncological treatment of advanced Pan-NET is dis-
cussed in the ENETS 2023 guidance paper for NF-Pan-NET.
The functioning syndrome should be analysed together with all
patient and tumour characteristics, as several therapeutic strategies
affect both the hormonal as well as the proliferative potential of Pan-
NET. Strategies that result in a reduction of tumour bulk generally also
significantly reduce patient hormonal symptoms. Cytoreductive sur-
gery should be considered with the aim of reducing tumour burden,
thus allowing better symptom control with medical treatment. Before
local treatment of NET liver metastases, a liver MRI, with diffusion-
weighted sequences and hepatocyte-specific contrast agent, is recom-
mended as the most sensitive tool to depict small (and large) lesions.79
Mayo et al. showed that patients with hormonally-functioning liver
metastases are those who benefit the most, in terms of both symp-
toms and survival, from liver-directed surgery.80 In general, cytoreduc-
tive surgery can be considered for patients with functioning tumours
when ≥70%–90% of visible disease can be debulked and the remain-
ing liver function is adequate81 [2b, B]. Percutaneous ablation by, for
example, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be performed in combina-
tion with surgical resection, allowing the treatment of isolated metas-
tases and leading to better symptomatic control82 [2b, B].
If the disease is predominantly located in the liver, transarterial
bland, chemo- or radioembolisation could be a treatment option in
cases of uncontrolled functioning syndrome despite optimal medical
therapy [2b, B].83 Because of the high morbidity risk associated with
this technique in cases of high metastatic load in the liver, the indica-
tion must be confirmed in a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team
attended by an interventional radiologist. To reduce morbidity, tar-
geted treatment to separate sections of the liver can be done in sepa-
rate sessions 4–8 weeks apart. Chemoembolisation may be more
effective than bland embolisation in metastatic Pan-NET.83,84 Che-
moembolisation is generally performed (under general anaesthesia)
using streptozotocin, doxorubicin or adriamycin. Liver failure consti-
tutes an absolute contraindication for (chemo)-embolisation, while
portal vein thrombosis is a relative contraindication.
The evidence supporting the use of systemic treatments is not
impacted by the presence or absence of functioning syndromes, since
most trials recruited patients with Pan-NET regardless of their function-
ing status. However, general principles should be taken into account,
mainly in the form of the expected toxicity profile of some of these
treatment options, which may be of special relevance to the functioning
syndromes. For several functioning syndromes, if supportive or surgical
measures are insufficient to control the hormonal symptoms, a trial of
somatostatin analogues (SSA) can be tried to reduce functioning activity.
SSA were first developed as antisecretory agents and have positive
effects on NET-associated hormonal complaints when somatostatin
receptors (SST1-SST5) are expressed by the tumours. Another advantage
is the possibility to increase the dose or shorten the interval of adminis-
tration in cases of clinical recurrence on standard doses. Systemic treat-
ment with chemotherapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy
(PRRT) plays a key role for selected patients for both control of tumour
growth and hormonal symptoms. One of the most commonly used che-
motherapy regimens is capecitabine associated with temozolomide
which had a response rate of 40% in grade 1–2 Pan-NET in a prospec-
tive, multicentre, randomised phase II trial.85 This treatment can also be
effective in well-differentiated grade 3 Pan-NET. As an alternative,
streptozotocin-based chemotherapy has been used for nearly 50 years
in the treatment of functioning Pan-NET. Concomitant therapy with
SSA can increase the rate of overall syndromic symptom control.

Insulinoma
In the control of insulinoma-related hypoglycaemia, fractioned diet
including complex carbohydrates with slow absorption is the corner-
stone to avoid prolonged fasting [5, A]. Simple carbohydrates as well
as glucose infusion are required in hypoglycaemic events. First-line
medical therapy for advanced insulinoma consists of diazoxide
(50–600 mg daily). In cases of refractory hypoglycaemia, incidental
descriptions also support the use of glucocorticoids, verapamil, and
diphenylhydantoin [5, D].
A CGMS could be a very useful tool in patients with insuli-
noma to early recognise a hypoglycaemic event and prevent
severe complications. Furthermore, it is also possible to connect
an infusion pump automatically administering glucose as required.
This is of special relevance in cases of unawareness of hypoglycae-
mia when autonomic symptoms are missing86 [5. C]. To manage
acute episodes of hypoglycaemia, glucagon therapy is now avail-
able in different formulations (intramuscular, subcutaneous, intra-
nasal). The intranasal spray formulation is easily administered and
rapidly effective in patients with severe hypoglycaemic events,
especially when an intravenous glucose infusion is not avail-
able87 [5, C].
SSA can reduce insulin levels and prevent hypoglycaemic epi-
sodes in patients with advanced insulinomas.88 On top of this, SSA
are the first-line choice for antiproliferative control in Pan-NET with
Ki67 index below 10% and limited tumour bulk.89 As SSA also
decrease glucagon secretion and SSTR expression can be limited in
insulinomas, which could paradoxically aggravate hypoglycaemia, a
trial with short-acting octreotide under close monitoring of glucose
levels is advised [5, D]. After demonstration of a positive effect on
glucose levels, long-acting release (LAR) octreotide or lanreotide can
be initiated. In cases with advanced insulinoma with hypoglycaemia
refractory
to
octreotide
or
lanreotide,
the
pan-somatostatin
receptor-targeting pasireotide can be tried off-label. Improvement of
hypoglycaemia was observed in several case reports after the start of
pasireotide90 [4, D].
In a multicentric retrospective study including 31 patients with
metastatic insulinoma, PRRT was performed in 14 patients, 13 of
whom (92.8%) had complete or partial control of hypoglycaemia syn-
drome91 [4, C]. In another single centre series, symptomatic
response to PRRT in terms of hypoglycaemia was observed in six
out of nine patients with malignant insulinoma.92 Everolimus is regis-
tered for progressive advanced Pan-NET and decreases insulin
secretion and action. In a retrospective, multicentre series 11 out of
12 patients demonstrated swift disappearance of hypoglycaemic
symptoms with a median symptom-free period of 6.5 months,
although tolerance was limited.93 Consequently, both PRRT with
177Lu-DOTATATE and everolimus can be considered in advanced
insulinoma cases with hypoglycaemia refractory to SSA, especially in
those cases with concurrent progressive disease [4, C]. Historically,
streptozotocin is well-known for its diabetogenic effects, making it a
suitable
alternative
for
high
grade
or
clinically
aggressive
insulinomas.
Radioembolisation together with chemoembolisation recently
proved to be highly effective in controlling hypoglycaemia in a series
of seven patients with malignant insulinoma, resulting in an initial clin-
ical success rate of 100% and in an overall clinical success rate of
85%94 [4, D].
Gastrinoma
The control of gastric acid hypersecretion is optimally achieved by
using PPIs [3, A]. Long-acting PPIs such as omeprazole 60 mg a day or
equivalent dose of lansoprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, rabepra-
zole, dexpansoprazole, once or twice a day, are durably effective in
patients with sporadic gastrinoma without evidence of tachyphylaxis.
Patients with MEN1-related gastrinoma may require a daily dose of
80–120 mg of omeprazole. Vitamin B12 deficiency, hypomagnesae-
mia as well as the risk of bone fractures should be monitored in NET
patients on long-term PPIs. H2 blockers are also effective but much
less employed because of their lower activity and need for very high
doses.
SSA are also effective to control gastrin hypersecretion and the
consequent gastric acid hypersecretion, but they are generally not
used for this purpose if no antitumour activity is required, due to the
high efficacy of PPIs. In a retrospective study, among 12 patients
with gastrinoma under treatment with standard doses of octreotide
and lanreotide, all but one achieved a complete clinical control with
SSA, even when not controlled by PPI therapy at baseline95 [4]. In a
prospective observational study on MEN1 patients with Pan-NET
less than 2 cm, those treated with lanreotide neither developed a
gastrinoma
nor
other
functioning
syndromes during
a
6-year
follow-up.96
In patients with gastrinoma treated with 90Y-DOTATOC alone
or in combination with
177Lu-DOTATATE clinical response and
objective response rates were observed in 16% and 30% of cases,
respectively.97 Among patients with functioning Pan-NET that had
undergone PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE, two of three with symp-
tomatic gastrinoma experienced a decrease of pyrosis or diarrhoea92
[4]. The symptomatic control paralleled that of tumour shrinkage
and decrease of hormonal secretion, but it was also observed in
some patients with stable/progressive disease. The timing of the
response was also in favour of PRRT, as the symptomatic response
preceded tumour response and frequently persisted after tumour
progression. Importantly, for all functioning Pan-NET, functioning
symptom deterioration due to release of hormone during PRRT or
immediately afterwards occurred in 9% of patients and it warrants
careful patient monitoring and preventive management strategies. It
is advised to keep the SSA-free period before the start of PRRT as
short as possible, with safe reintroduction of SSA 1 h after the infu-
sion of 177Lu-DOTATATE.

Rare functioning Pan-NET syndromes
The treatment of symptoms in glucagonoma is based on SSA, which are
effective in the majority of advanced glucagonomas regardless of the
antitumour activity.98 Amino acid infusion as well as zinc therapy have
been suggested to improve skin lesions of necrolytic migratory ery-
thema99 [4, D]. Due to its effects on glucose levels, everolimus should
be used with caution in patients with glucagonoma with careful moni-
toring of glucose levels. Early symptomatic responses to PRRT were
observed in five of seven (71%) patients with uncontrolled glucagonoma
syndrome, and no hormonal crisis was observed in this series92 [4, D].
Diarrhoea in VIPoma can be debilitating and life-threatening.
Resuscitation with intravenous fluids and electrolytes is warranted in
severe cases. VIPomas are also sensitive to SSA treatment, making it
first choice for preoperative stabilisation and in advanced disease [4,
D]. In a retrospective multicentre French series, SSA alone improved
VIPoma-associated symptoms in nine out of 11 patients,100 whereas
SSA controlled hormonal symptoms in 24 out of 24 cases reported in
the Chinese literature.101 Alternatively, glucocorticoids have histori-
cally been shown to reduce diarrhoea in VIPoma patients.102 In a
French study, VIPoma-associated diarrhoea was controlled in 10 out
of 12 patients receiving chemotherapy and in all four patients receiv-
ing sunitinib. In an English series, chemotherapy and sunitinib were
only effective in controlling VIPoma symptoms in two out of five and
two out of six patients, respectively. When combined, two series
have shown that PRRT led to improvement of VIPoma symptoms in
nine out of 11 patients.92,103 Together, these limited retrospective
data make chemotherapy, sunitinib and PRRT second-line options to
be considered in patients with refractory advanced VIPoma, espe-
cially in cases of disease progression [4, D].
Acromegaly due to ectopic GHRH secretion, similarly to acromeg-
aly caused by a GH-secreting pituitary tumour, responds favourably
to SSA,104,105 making them the first-line choice [3, B]. In cases of con-
tinued IGF-1 elevation, pegvisomant can be added to control the
acromegaly effects [4, D]. First-line treatment of Cushing's syndrome
due to ACTH-secreting Pan-NET is represented by steroidogenic
enzyme inhibitors, such as metyrapone, osilodrostat or ketoconazole
[4, B]. Alternatively, positive clinical responses to SSA and dopamine
agonists have been described and these treatments might be consid-
ered as second-line options.106 Severe cases of Cushing's syndrome
constitute endocrine emergencies and should prompt consideration
of
bilateral
adrenalectomy
in
an
experienced
multidisciplinary
team [4, B].
Medical management of the carcinoid syndrome associated with
Pan-NET is similar to that in patients with midgut or bronchial NET.26
SSA have been shown to exert antihormonal effects in case reports
and small series of patients with hypercalcemia due to PTHrP
production,107 hypercalcitoninaemia108 and even somatostatinoma109
[4, C]. In PTHrP-hypersecreting Pan-NET, supportive therapy includes
hyperhydration with oral and/or intravenous fluids, denosumab
and zoledronic acid.110 Calcitonin and loop diuretics constitute
second-line options for refractory humoral hypercalcemia of malig-
nancy [4, C].
Recommendations:
• Management of each functioning Pan-NET syndrome in
patients with advanced disease requires a tailored multi-
modal approach of supportive, surgical, interventional,
hormonal and antiproliferative therapies [5, A].
• Strategies that result in a reduction of tumour bulk gener-
ally also significantly reduce patient hormonal symptoms
[2b, B]. Cytoreductive surgery can be considered for
patients with functioning tumours when ≥70%–90% of
visible disease can be debulked. Alternative locoregional
therapies include RFA and transarterial bland, chemo- or
radioembolisation [2b, B].
• When dedicated supportive therapy for a functioning
Pan-NET syndrome is insufficient, palliative SSA treat-
ment can be initiated. PRRT, chemotherapy, everolimus
or
sunitinib
should
generally
be
reserved
for
SSA-refractory cases [4, B].
Q9:
What
is
the
recommended
follow-up
in
functioning
Pan-NET syndromes after curative resection?
In several earlier studies, patients with functioning tumours
postoperatively displayed a better prognosis than NF-Pan-NET. This
is believed to be related to the fact that NF-Pan-NET are usually
larger at diagnosis as they do not have hormonal symptoms and are
consequently discovered later. However, a recent study from the
SEER database, including 2571 resected patients, contradicts this
point, reporting no difference in terms of OS and cancer-specific
survival.111
Insulinoma, if localised, radically operated and without signs of
malignancy nor grade 3 only need a single follow-up after 3–6 months
[5, A]. If a patient's symptoms have resolved no further follow-up is
needed, although the patient should be instructed to seek medical
attention upon recurrence of symptoms of hypoglycaemia.
For other functioning syndromes that usually have more malig-
nant potential the frequency of follow-up is every 3–6-12 months,
similar to NF-Pan-NET [5, B]. The interval is dependent on the tumour
grade, bulk and growth rate as well as current therapy. A more fre-
quent follow-up is needed in patients with refractory symptoms of
functioning syndromes. The type and interval of radiological follow-
up is independent of functioning syndromes. On the other hand, spe-
cific hormones such as glucagon, gastrin, ACTH, VIP etc. should be
measured at each follow-up in patients with functioning Pan-NET.
Any evidence of recurrence and aggravation of hormonal symptoms
should prompt immediate clinical and biochemical re-evaluation. One
should also keep in mind that patients can present with an additional
syndrome or switch hormonal profile during their lifetime, underlining
the importance of appropriate history-taking.4,5

Recommendations:
• Localised low-grade insulinomas are cured by radical sur-
gery and do not require long-term follow-up [3, A].
• Follow-up of functioning Pan-NET should be tailored
according to tumour grade, bulk, growth rate and the
therapeutic modality [5, A].
• Metachronous functioning syndromes can develop during
follow-up, requiring appropriate history taking of Pan-
NET patients and, in cases of a suspected new syndrome,
subsequent measurement of hormonal levels [5, A].
Conclusion and future perspectives
The management of patients with a functioning Pan-NET syndrome is
complex due to its heterogeneous presentation and multisystem
involvement. Consequently, work-up and treatment of a (suspected)
functioning syndrome should preferably be performed in a multidisci-
plinary setting and discussed in expert tumour boards.
Due to the rarity and diversity of functioning Pan-NET syndromes
many clinical aspects, including the optimal diagnostic work-up and
management, have been poorly characterised. These Pan-NET fea-
tures and their intrinsic heterogeneity112 have also hampered a
detailed understanding of the molecular factors that drive NET cells
to cause aberrant hormonal secretion and tumour development, which
remain largely unknown. Several recent national registries have been
able to increase patient numbers for functioning Pan-NET, allowing
for better characterisation of clinical syndromes. However, yearly inci-
dence rates lower than 1 in 100.000–1.000.000 persons require eval-
uation in multinational patient cohorts, preferably in a prospective
fashion. This will aid in determining the optimal cutoff for biochemical
diagnosis, which is still needed for these syndromes. Furthermore, it
will allow the study of treatment outcomes for functioning Pan-NET,
both in terms of hormonal symptom control as well as radical re-
section rates and antiproliferative capacity. Through international col-
laboration
interventional
trials
aimed
at
a
well-characterised
population within these orphan diseases can also be initiated. It is cru-
cial that these clinical studies are coupled to carefully designed trans-
lational research programmes, including systematic collection and
analysis of tumour and blood samples from patients. These types of
joint collaborative, international projects will foster translational
research in order to decipher the molecular underpinnings of Pan-
NET tumourigenesis, identify potential biomarkers for disease progno-
sis and response prediction and discover new druggable targets.
Recently, large scale international collaborative studies are enabling
the characterisation through omics approaches of the main molecular
layers of Pan-NET.34,113,114 Ongoing efforts should focus on mining
and extracting the clinically useful information from these studies in
order to better classify, stratify, and diagnose functioning Pan-NET.
Furthermore, elucidation of (duodenal and) pancreatic neuroendocrine
cell function through contemporary molecular techniques, in vitro pri-
mary tumour cell cultures and development of patient-derived orga-
noids and tumour xenografts, can be of major assistance in future
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
strategies
in
functioning
Pan-NET
syndromes.
