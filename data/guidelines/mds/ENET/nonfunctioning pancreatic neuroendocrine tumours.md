Abstract
This ENETS guidance paper for well-differentiated nonfunctioning pancreatic neuro-
endocrine tumours (NF-Pan-NET) has been developed by a multidisciplinary working
group, and provides up-to-date and practical advice on the management of these
tumours. Using the extensive experience of centres treating patients with NF-Pan-
NEN, the authors of this guidance paper discuss 10 troublesome questions in every-
day clinical practice. Our many years of experience in this field are still being verified
in the light of the results of new clinical, which set new ways of proceeding in NEN.
The treatment of NF-Pan-NEN still requires a decision of a multidisciplinary team of
specialists in the field of neuroendocrine neoplasms.

INTRODUCTION
This
ENETS
guidance
paper
for
the
management
of
well-
differentiated nonfunctioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours
(NF-Pan-NET) aims to answer 10 major questions (Table 1) on the
management of these neoplasms.
Data were identified by MEDLINE database searches and expert
opinion. Recommendations are given according to the best available
evidence and authors' experience and will have a level of evidence
(1–5) and strength of recommendation (A–D) (Table 2) as per the
GRADE system.1
The incidence of Pan-NET is rising, most recently reported as
0.48 per 100,000 new cases per year according to the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Programme; although Pan-NET
carry an unfavourable prognosis compared to NET from other primary
sites, an improvement in overall survival (OS) has been observed over
time (median OS of 3.6 years), particularly in patients with distant
metastases.2
The majority (between 50% and 85%) of Pan-NET are nonfunc-
tioning. Moreover, NF-Pan-NET tend to present with more advanced
disease (more advanced tumour [T]-stage, lymph node involvement
and liver metastases) and arise in the head of the pancreas. Conse-
quently, patients with NF-Pan-NET have a significantly worse OS than
their functioning counterparts (p < .001).3,4
In patients undergoing curative resection, a shorter survival
was observed in patients with NF-Pan-NET, lymphatic invasion,
and size >10 cm, while a shorter disease-free survival (DFS)
was associated with advanced pT-stage (pT3–4), size >5 cm and
histological
grade

DIAGNOSIS
2.1
|
Q1. How should we define and characterise a
NF-Pan-NET at presentation?
While the diagnosis of functionality relies on the presence of a
hormonal syndrome, the NET-diagnosis relies on histological or cyto-
logical analysis. Histopathological diagnosis is based on the neuroen-
docrine growth pattern, including nesting, trabecular, gyriform and
solid architecture, as well as the expression of neuroendocrine
markers including synaptophysin and chromogranin A (CgA).6 It should
be noted that in the pancreas, especially acinic cell carcinoma, solid
pseudopapillary neoplasm and paraganglioma can be positive for
these markers, and therefore they should be actively excluded.7 More
recently, the transcription factor INSM1 has emerged as a both sensi-
tive and specific diagnostic marker of NET. Grading is assessed by

measuring proliferation using mitotic figures (expressed as mito-
ses/2 mm2) and expression of the Ki-67 antigen (as percentage of all
tumour cells), with cutoffs of 3% and 20% for NET G2 and G3, respec-
tively.8 DAXX and ATRX mutations that are accompanied by loss of
nuclear expression of the respective proteins are indicative of chromo-
somal instability, epigenetic progression, and increased risk of recurrence
after surgery with curative intent, and are therefore of additional prog-
nostic value.9 Specifically, analysis of a large international cohort of spo-
radic NET indicated that ATRX/DAXX and ALT were independent
negative prognostic factors providing evidence suggesting their
evaluation
particularly
in
≤2.0 cm
tumours.10
Somatostatin
receptor-2 (SST2) expression can be assessed by immunohisto-
chemistry, especially, if no preoperative somatostatin-receptor
imaging (SRI) was performed.11
In the case of suspected pancreatic metastases from another pri-
mary cancer, transcription factors with some specificity for NET
organs of origin (TTF-1 for lung and thyroid, CDX-2 for ileum and
Islet-1 for pancreas) can be used.12 Immunohistochemical expression
of hormones is frequently observed in NF-Pan-NET, and their pres-
ence alone does not justify defining a Pan-NET as functioning unless a
related clinical syndrome is present. Expression of cytokeratin
excludes the rare occurrence of intrapancreatic paraganglioma.
Further molecular grouping using RNAseq and methylation arrays
may provide additional diagnostic (cell and organ of origin) or prog-
nostic value, but are as yet not routinely used. The clinical utility of
these markers to predict benefit from specific therapies remains to be
demonstrated in prospective studies.
In rare cases (<10%), NF-Pan-NET may become functioning and pre-
sent hormonal symptoms during the clinical evolution of the disease. This
underscores the importance of detailed assessment of symptoms at each
follow-up visit, particularly in patients with familial NF-Pan-NET.
Histological confirmation of small (<1–2 cm) incidental NF-Pan-NET
is recommended, if possible, to exclude the possibility of other
somatostatin-avid lesions in the pancreas such as an ectopic spleen, PP-
islets, or the rare occurrence of metastasis from other neoplasms. While
small biopsy sample analysis carries a risk of under-grading due to sam-
pling bias, it can allow the confirmation of NET diagnosis. If patients are
to be followed-up only, exclusion of a higher grade or, as mentioned
above, the presence of DAXX/ATRX loss, may be helpful.6
Genetic counselling is indicated in the setting of multiple Pan-
NET,
the
combination
with
pancreatic
nesidioblastosis,
extra-
pancreatic involvement suggestive of other polyendocrine tumours
(type 1 or type 4 multiple endocrine neoplasia [MEN] or von Hippel–
Lindau [VHL] disease), or if Pan-NET occur in young patients (30–
50 years). The relevance of the reported observation of DNA damage
repair gene mutations in up to 10% of apparently sporadic Pan-NET
patients is not yet clear.13
2.1.1
|
Recommendations
1. The histopathological work-up of a Pan-NET must include the
demonstration of two endocrine markers and assessment of
proliferation (Ki-67 index) (Level of evidence 1: Grade of recom-
mendation A).
2. Suspected small (<2 cm) NF-Pan-NET with a positive somatostatin-
receptor imaging should be histologically/cytologically confirmed if
possible (Level of evidence 3: Grade of recommendation B).
2.2
|
Q2. Which biochemical tests should be
performed in a patient with NF-Pan-NET (current and
novel biomarkers)?
2.2.1
|
Nonspecific markers
The determination of CgA levels in serum is not a reliable marker for
making a diagnosis of NF-Pan-NET; as this polypeptide is secreted by
neuroendocrine cells, it is not specific for NF-Pan-NET and has many
interferences causing false elevations.14,15
However, CgA may be reliable in the assessment of response to
treatment, and for the detection of disease progression and recur-
rence. To monitor the course of the disease, it is advisable to deter-
mine CgA with the same assessment method, which should be
standardised.16
A useful circulating marker for NF-Pan-NET might be the serum
pancreatic polypeptide (PP), especially for NET included in the MEN-1
syndrome. Nevertheless, the percentage of patients with elevated PP
concentration is much lower than that of patients with elevated CgA
concentration.16,17
High hopes have been placed on new molecular markers. The
NETest is a blood multianalyte biomarker test where the expression
profile of selected gene transcripts characteristic for NEN is analysed.
NETest has been reported superior to circulating CgA; it showed a sig-
nificant advantage over other molecular biomarkers in the diagnosis
and monitoring of NEN, may be used to monitor the effectiveness of
treatment, and the assessment of disease progression.18–21 It is not
specific for NF-Pan-NET however, and its clinical-practical usefulness
is therefore lessened.
Circulating microRNAs are potential biomarkers of NEN, not least
due to their presence stability in body fluids and specificity for a given
tumour,22,23
but
their
clinical
significance
has
to
be
further
investigated.
2.2.2
|
Specific markers
The assessment of the blood level of specific markers (gastrin, insulin,
serotonin, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide [VIP], glucagon, somato-
statin) can be determined at the first patient visit to identify patients
with functioning syndromes. In the absence of hormonal symptoms,
further monitoring of these tests is not recommended.
In patients with Pan-NET, tests for MEN-1 syndrome should be
performed in the presence of clinical or pathological suspicion (cf Q1).
Basic screening tests in patients with suspected or documented
MEN-1 include the assessment of ionised or total calcium, parathyroid

hormone (intact PTH), prolactin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-
1). In patients with suspected MEN-1 based on these tests, genetic
counselling and genetic testing should be performed to identify muta-
tions in the menin-encoding MEN1 gene.15–17,22,24
2.2.3
|
Recommendations
1. No routine circulating biomarkers are established for NF-Pan-NET
diagnosis; CgA determination may be useful in monitoring the
course of the disease. If the MEN-1 is suspected, it is advisable to
determine the concentration of calcium, PTH, and pituitary hor-
mones (mainly prolactin) (Level of evidence 3b: Grade of recom-
mendation B).

Q3. What is the most suitable imaging work-
up for NF-Pan-NET patients
The imaging requirements will vary on the clinical scenario; these are
set out below.
2.4
|
Identification of NF-Pan-NET
The imaging modalities allowing identification and characterisation of
NF-Pan-NET consist of multiphasic contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and mag-
netic resonance cholangio-pancreatography (MRCP), somatostatin
receptor imaging (SRI) (preferably using positron emission tomography
(PET)/CT) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) (optionally with
intravenous contrast material). Transabdominal ultrasound has limited
sensitivity for Pan-NET even with the use of intravenous contrast
material (contrast-enhanced ultrasound-CEUS).
The sequence of imaging modalities should be selected based on
individual
considerations.
MRI
is
the
least
invasive
modality
(no endoscopy, no ionising radiation). Early arterial phases of contrast-
enhanced CT and MRI should be performed to detect hyperarterialised
NF-Pan-NET. Somatostatin receptor (SST) PET/CT is advantageous for
definitive NET diagnosis (although it does not circumvent the need for
pathological examination) and provides whole-body staging with high
accuracy. EUS is highly sensitive for NF-Pan-NET, notably when their
small size limits their detection with other imaging modalities.
Tumour sampling should be carried out on the most easily-
accessible tumour site. Hence, it is recommended to perform EUS-
guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) or EUS-guided fine-needle
biopsy sampling (EUS-FNB) of the primary Pan-NET (or percutaneous
CT-guided biopsy in case of repeated failure) in the absence of metas-
tases or in cases of inaccessible metastases. Otherwise, percutaneous
ultrasound-, CT-, or MRI-guided biopsies of metastases are preferred,
especially where there is liver involvement.

Therapy planning
2.5.1
|
Whole-body staging
Full staging of NF-Pan-NET should be performed using the best per-
forming imaging techniques [CT, MRI, and SRI (preferably with
PET/CT)] to obtain accurate information about the extension of the
disease.
Transabdominal ultrasound is often an initial test, especially in
the identification of liver metastases. Even though CEUS can
improve the detection of liver lesions and may enable quick adjust-
ment of the subsequent diagnostic pathway, its limited reproduc-
ibility
and
lack
of
comprehensive
image
material
for
later
discussions in tumour boards support different imaging modalities
to allow for therapy decisions.
Contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT is the basic imaging
modality for initial work-up and follow-up as it has a significant yield
for diagnosis, local and distant staging and restaging.25 It must be per-
formed with (at least) acquisitions at the arterial (25–30 s, bolus track-
ing recommended) and then the portal venous (70–90 s) phases, since
some highly vascularised NF-Pan-NET are only visible at one phase or
another.26 Early hyperenhancement in multiphasic CT of NF-Pan-NET
and related metastases may be associated with slower tumour pro-
gression.27 Chest CT (optimally in full inspiration) must be performed
for distant staging, at least for locally advanced (T4, N+) or metastatic
NF-Pan-NET and in patients with MEN1.
The functional imaging modality of choice for initial staging is
SST-PET/CT and should be considered for all patients with NF-Pan-
NET. It has high diagnostic accuracy, superior to CT alone, and has
demonstrated significant impact on clinical decisions.28 SST-PET/
CT has almost entirely replaced scintigraphy including SPECT. SST-
PET is not a substitute for morphological imaging by contrast-
enhanced CT or MRI because it lacks anatomic topography. SST-
PET/CT may be performed using 68Ga-DOTATATE, 68Ga-DOTA-
TOC or 68Ga-DOTANOC, with no strong arguments for choosing
one over another. In addition, SST-PET/CT may now be performed
using 64Cu-DOTATATE that has been approved in the USA, or
under a compassionate use permission in Europe, and seems to
have a better lesion detection ability.29 Low uptake on SST-PET is
correlated with poor prognosis30 while high uptake predicts effi-
cacy of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). Hence, it is
recommended for the diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic evalu-
ation of all patients with NF-Pan-NET associated with metastases
or at metastatic risk.25,28
18Fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG] PET/CT may be valuable for prog-
nostication and therapy planning. SRI- and FDG-PET/CT provide com-
plementary information. FDG-PET should be performed for staging of
NF-Pan-NET if no uptake is shown on SST-PET/CT. In addition, high
FDG uptake correlates with a higher grade and is a strong poor prog-
nostic factor.31 Hence, it can be performed in NF-Pan-NET of any
grade and any uptake on SSTR-PET/CT, if a positive result is expected
to change patient management.

2.5.2
|
Assessment of resectability
Resectability of NF-Pan-NET depends on the extent of the
primary tumour and whether metastases are present and resect-
able with macroscopically negative margins. In this curative-intent
setting, the highest accuracy for liver metastases detection and
characterisation is needed. The optimal strategy consists of liver
MRI including DWI, preferably using a hepatocyte-specific con-
trast agent (additionally to SST-PET/CT or as hybrid SST-PET/
MR).25,32
With regard to the primary tumour, the morphological resectabil-
ity criteria are similar to those of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC), including degree of vessel involvement. This can be assessed
by CE dynamic CT as the method of choice, or alternatively using
MRI, which was comparable to CT in a recent meta-analysis on
PDAC.33
EUS is also useful in patients with potentially resectable NF-
Pan-NET to assess tumour size, vascular involvement, relationship to
the main pancreatic duct, behaviour at dynamic contrast-enhanced
EUS and for EUS-guided sampling.34,35 However, EUS and EUS-
guided sampling are not recommended in situations where they are
not expected to change patient management.
2.5.3
|
Recommendations
1. Dedicated pancreatic imaging to search for a NF-Pan-NET should
employ
multiphasic
contrast-enhanced
CT
and/or
dynamic
contrast-enhanced MRI including MRCP and DWI, and SST-PET/
CT, and/or EUS including intravenous contrast administration
based on individual considerations (Level of evidence 2a: Grade of
recommendation B).
2. SST-PET/CT should be considered as the first-line functional imag-
ing method for the initial staging and characterisation of patients
with NF-Pan-NET (Level of evidence 2a: Grade of recommenda-
tion B).
3. Whole-body staging relies on contrast-enhanced CT of Chest,
abdomen (at least biphasic including an early arterial contrast
phase) and pelvis, and SST-PET/CT (Level of evidence 3a: Grade of
recommendation B).
4. Local resectability assessment of the primary requires contrast-
enhanced CT and/or MRI (Level of evidence 2a: Grade of recom-
mendation A).
5. Liver MRI including DWI and preferably using a hepatocyte-
specific contrast agent should be performed to rule out liver
metastases or to precisely assess their number, distribution, resect-
ability and accessibility to non-surgical local therapy (Level of evi-
dence 3a: Grade of recommendation B).
6. The use of FDG-PET/CT for prognostic evaluation can be of inter-
est in patients with NF-Pan-NET of any grade and any uptake on
SRI, if its result is expected to change patient management (Level
of evidence 3b: Grade of recommendation C).

TREATMENT
3.1

Q4. What is the appropriate surgical
management of NF-Pan- NET?
3.1.1
|
Which are the principles/aims of treatment
in a patient with localised stage NF-pancreatic NET?
Curative resection for NF-Pan-NET is associated with 5-year survival
rates of 70%–80%.36 Ensuring that surgery is indicated as an appro-
priate therapy still remains the most important factor in order to avoid
unnecessary and possibly harmful surgical procedures. It is currently
established that not all localised NF-Pan-NET have the same biology.
On the one hand, small, low-grade and asymptomatic NET usually
have a negligible risk of malignant progression. On the other hand,
large and higher-grade lesions frequently exhibit an aggressive behav-
iour with a high propensity for extra-pancreatic spread. It is then of
paramount importance to accurately select patients and to offer a per-
sonalised surgical approach, as indicated.
NF-Pan-NET ≤2 cm show a relatively indolent behaviour with a
limited risk of progression. Therefore, a surveillance strategy has gen-
erally been advocated A multicentre prospective observational study
from the Netherlands (PANDORA study) is currently ongoing with the
aim to evaluate the feasibility of a follow-up protocol for NF-Pan-NET
≤2 cm.37 After a median follow-up of 17 months, 89% of 76 patients
had no signs of tumour progression, whereas 11% showed an increase
in tumour size of more than 0.5 cm/year. Overall, 6% of patients
underwent surgery during follow-up. Of those, one patient had an
unexpected intraoperative detection of peritoneal lesion and had a
recurrence diagnosed during the postoperative follow-up.
ENETS has promoted another larger prospective, observational
study (ASPEN study) that involves more than 40 institutions world-
wide, and is currently enrolling a total of 1000 patients affected by
asymptomatic NF-Pan-NET ≤2 cm. The ASPEN study will describe the
real-world clinical management of this disease, including an active sur-
veillance strategy and surgical resection for these small lesions. An
interim analysis of the study has observed that the vast majority
(81%) of these patients underwent a ‘watchful waiting’ strategy.38
Among patients underwent surgery, histological features of aggres-
siveness were associated with a dilation of the main pancreatic duct.
Moreover, all the patients with histological features of aggressiveness
and a nondilated main duct had a tumour diameter larger than 1 cm.
Alternative treatment surgical modalities for small NF-Pan-NET
have been proposed. In particular, preliminary experience has shown
that radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be effective in the treatment
of these tumours. Nevertheless, robust data on the routine use of
RFA in NF-Pan-NET are still lacking. A prospective, single-arm, study
on the safety and efficacy of EUS-guided RFA for Pan-NET is under-
way (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03834701). Despite some initial
reports, there is no evidence supporting the use of somatostatin ana-
logues in controlling disease progression of small NF-Pan-NET during
surveillance.

When indicated, surgical resection of NF-Pan-NET should be per-
formed according to the site of the lesion. Parenchyma-sparing pan-
creatic resections have been proposed to reduce the risks of
postoperative pancreatic function impairment. These procedures
(i.e., enucleation and central pancreatectomy) are associated with a
lower risk of severe complications and have similar long-term onco-
logic outcomes compared to standard resection.39 The main drawback
of atypical resections is the lack of an adequate lymphadenectomy,
and, for this reason, they should be avoided in patients with Pan-NET
at risk for nodal metastases. Unfortunately, there are no preoperative
examinations able to accurately predict the presence of nodal involve-
ment in NF-Pan-NET.40 Consequently, lymphadenectomy should be
routinely performed for NF-Pan-NET >3 cm. The opportunity to per-
form an enucleation or a central pancreatectomy for lesions between
2 and 3 cm, should be carefully considered in relation to patients'
comorbidities and the risk associated with an anatomical pancreatic
resection.
When surgery is indicated, a minimally invasive approach is asso-
ciated with an improved postoperative outcome and it should be pre-
ferred to an open approach whenever feasible, especially for all
resectable NF-Pan-NET located in the body-tail of the pancreas.41
Robust data are still lacking regarding the safety and the efficacy of
minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy. Nevertheless, minimally
invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy, when performed in experienced
centres, can be offered in selected cases after a meticulous balance of
risks and benefits for the patient.
3.1.2
|
Recommendations
1. Patients with asymptomatic NF-Pan-NET ≤1 cm without dilation
of the main pancreatic duct should undergo active surveillance.
The management of patients with NF-Pan-NET >1 cm and ≤2 cm,
without dilation of the main pancreatic duct, should be persona-
lised according to the type of needed surgical resection as well as
to patients' comorbidities (Level of evidence 3: Grade of recom-
mendation B).
2. Surgery is strongly recommended for all NF-Pan-NET associated
with main pancreatic duct dilation and/or larger >2 cm (Level of
evidence 3: Grade of recommendation B). A minimally invasive
approach for lesions of the body-tail, and for all those that can be
enucleated, should be preferred whenever possible after a careful
assessment of possible associated risks (Level of evidence 3: Grade
of recommendation B).
3.1.3
|
What are the principles/aims of treatment in
a patient with advanced stage NF-pancreatic NET?
Pancreatic resections are complex procedures with perioperative mor-
bidity rates up to 50% and a risk of death in up to 3% in high volume
centres.42 Hence, the indication for surgery in Pan-NET, in which the
gland texture is softness, needs careful selection. In localised small
tumours, avoidance of unnecessary operations in the light of surveil-
lance seems a feasible option, whereas advanced tumours need a
careful risk–benefit assessment.
To date, there is no validated consensus on the definition of
resectability of NF-Pan-NET. In clinical practice, locally advanced or
borderline resectable tumours are classified according to the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) definition used for PDAC.
This classification is based on the involvement of surrounding vessels,
distant spread, or extra-regional lymph node disease. The ENETS as
well as the American Joint Cancer Committee (AJCC) staging systems
define T3 and T4 tumours as either a size of >4 cm or growth beyond
the pancreas (T3) or invasion of adjacent structures or arterial vessels
(T4), which fits quite well with the NCCN definition of borderline or
locally advanced PDAC.
To evaluate the efficacy of any surgical procedure and outweigh
the risk, prediction of tumour recurrence and estimation of the chance
for cure is essential. The main risk factors for recurrence after surgical
resection are based on pathological factors (grade, Ki-67 index, size,
perineural invasion or lymph node or distant metastasis), clinical fac-
tors (symptomatic tumours, gender, CgA level, type of surgery or
imaging) and molecular factors (e.g. DAXX/ATRX loss, high Vimentin
expression and loss of E-cadherin).43 In general, risk of recurrence is
reported in the range 12%–18%, with the liver as the most common
site, local relapse at the resection site is uncommon (2%).42,44,45
Heidsma et al.44 have recently reported a large validation cohort of
342 resected G1 and G2 NF-Pan-NET patients from seven centres in
Europe, showing the high predictive value of a nomogram including
lymph node metastasis, G2 tumours and perineural invasion. Patients
with distant metastasis, G3 NET and hereditary syndromes were
excluded. In the low-risk group without any of the 3 risk factors the
5-year recurrence rate was 8%, whereas in the high-risk group
the recurrence rate was 65%. Another international study group
developed a similar, validated recurrence risk score (RRS; 1–10 points)
in 1006 resected NF-Pan-NET patients. Points were given for LN
metastasis, symptoms (jaundice, pain, or bleeding), size >2 cm and Ki-
67 index. Ki-67 index >20% had the highest impact for recurrence
and was therefore given 6 points. After 2 years 33% developed recur-
rence in the high-risk group (6–10 points) whereas only 2% recurred
in the low-risk group.46 Hence, patients after resection could be strati-
fied into a frequent or infrequent follow-up protocol. Furthermore
high risk patients might be considered for adjuvant treatment, ideally
within clinical trials.
Outcome data after resection of locally advanced NF-Pan-NET
are scarce. A large international cohort compared 61 patients who
underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with portal vein re-
section with 480 patients having a standard PD.47 Perioperative mor-
tality was 1% and the complication rate was 48% in the venous
resection group versus 33% in the group without. After matched pair
analysis, OS and recurrences rates were not different among the
groups (71% vs. 69%). The conclusion was that even extended re-
section including vascular reconstruction is safe with good long-term
outcomes. Advances in systemic therapies opened perspectives for
neoadjuvant treatments. Better local control or tumour shrinkage

might enhance resection rates of primarily unresectable patients and
improve recurrence rates. PRRT seems a promising tool for SST-
positive locally advanced NF-Pan-NET or even tumours with limited
distant metastasis (oligometastatic disease). The first clinical study by
Partelli et al. in 2018 retrospectively compared 23 patients operated
after PRRT with patients who had undergone upfront resection.48 In
addition to a higher R0 resection rate and less positive lymph nodes
in the PRRT group, the postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) rate
decreased, which might be an important safety issue after this compli-
cated type of surgery with POPF as its most dreadful complication.
These data must be validated in a prospective study, one of such has
recently
completed
the
accrual
(ClinicalTrial.gov
Identifier:
NCT04385992), and results will be expected in 2023. Another study
from India49 assessed 57 patients with unresectable primary tumours
of pancreatic or duodenal origin and/or potentially resectable oligo-
metastatic liver lesions. PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE lead to a com-
plete or partial response in 84% of patients, and one out of four
patients became resectable. Although these data has to be viewed
with caution due to its retrospective nature and high risk of bias, this
treatment strategy seems at least safe and feasible.
In clinical practice, chemotherapy is another potentially effective
treatment for neoadjuvant/preoperative purposes, given the poten-
tially high response rate associated with this therapeutic option. How-
ever, there is a need for clinical trials to assess the role of
chemotherapy in these specific settings.

Q5. What is the role of PRRT in specific
settings of NF-Pan- NET
PRRT is an effective and relatively safe therapeutic option for patients
with NF-Pan-NET. The two-arm randomised phase II noncomparative
OCLURANDOM trial of PRRT and sunitinib in SST-PET/CT-positive
advanced Pan-NET patients met its primary endpoint by achieving a
significant PFS with PRRT (177Lu-DOTATATE) (median 20.7 months
of PRRT and 11.0 months of sunitinib, respectively).50
A recent retrospective study, NETTER-R, also suggested a poten-
tial benefit of 177Lu-DOTATATE as a treatment option in Pan-NET.51
Current clinical trials are focusing on the prospective evaluation
of
PRRT
in
Pan-NET
(including
G3)
and
in
the
first-line
(NCT03972488, NCT04919226).
In 2020, a combined analysis of two prospective and six retro-
spective studies using PRRT in Pan-NET was published, showing a
median PFS ranging from 20 to 39 months and median OS from 37 to
79 months (PFS and OS were comparable for gastroenteropancreatic
(GEP)-NET from different locations).52
There are still limited data on the efficacy of PRRT for Pan-NET
G3. In 2019, Zhang et al. reported the results of PRRT with 177Lu/
90Y-
(DOTATATE
or
DOTATOC)
in
69
patients,
including
46 patients with Pan-NET. Promising results have been obtained
especially in patients with Ki-67 ≤55%.53 Carlsen et al. published a
study of NET G3 and NEC where 89 patients were G3 Pan-NET or
Pan-NEC and they found promising response rates in these highly
selected patient populations.54 Similar results were obtained by
Thang et al. in a group of 17 patients (17/28) with G3 Pan-NET
with or without radiosensitising chemotherapy.55 Nevertheless, it
is necessary to perform prospective studies to fully define the role
of PRRT in Pan-NET G3.
PRRT can be used in the treatment of NF-Pan-NET G3 with high
SST expression only within clinical trials. Currently, the NETTER-2 trial
(clinicaltrials.gov NCT03972488) comparing PRRT with high-dose
octreotide LAR completed the accrual and its results are waiting. Fur-
thermore the COMPOSE trial (NCT04919226) is ongoing, to compare
PRRT with chemotherapy or everolimus in higher grade 2 and G3 GEP
NET.24,56–59
Based on the studies published so far, it can be said that for
SSTR-positive NF-Pan-NET there are several lines of treatment avail-
able, but the optimal sequences of treatment lines, including PRRT,
have not been established to date.

Retreatment with PRRT
In a meta-analysis of 13 studies by Strosberg et al. after re-PRRT,
median PFS was 12.5 months, median OS 26.8 months. Based
on data from 3 NET- referral centres (Erasmus, Rotterdam;
Royal Free, London; and University of Bonn, with a total of
224 patients), the median PFS was 12.5 months and the safety
profile of 177Lu-PRRT retreatment was similar to the initial PRRT
treatment.60
In the case of progression after effective radioisotope therapy
lasting for a year or more, a repetition of PRRT may be considered.
However, repeated PRRT is associated with a shorter PFS.56–58 If a
decision is made to repeat PRRT-due to the greater toxicity of 90Y-the
use of 177Lu is recommended. Individual dosimetry measurements
should also be considered.56–58,60

Q6. What is the role of biotherapy and
molecular targeted therapies in specific settings of NF-
Pan-NET?
Expression on the membrane of NET cells of the protein G-coupled
receptors SST 1–5 has led to major advances in both diagnosis and
treatment of GEP-NET. Lanreotide extended-release aqueous-gel for-
mulation (lanreotide autogel) and octreotide long-acting repeatable
(LAR), two somatostatin analogues (SSA) targeting SSTs, are normally
used as first-line treatment of advanced NF-Pan-NET, particularly in
patients with relatively slow-growing disease. CLARINET was the first
clinical trial to prospectively demonstrate that lanreotide autogel pro-
longed PFS (hazard ratio [HR]:0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
0.32–1.04) when compared to placebo in a cohort of NF-Pan-NET
with a Ki-67 index <10%.61 To our knowledge, there are no random-
ised data with octreotide LAR; however, both SSA were shown to
exhibit similar efficacy and safety in a real-world practice report from
the Spanish R-GETNE registry. This result was externally validated by
an independent series of 535 patients with well-differentiated (Ki-
67 ≤20%) metastatic GEP-NET treated with first line with SSA mono-
therapy; no clinically relevant differences in PFS where observed
(HR 0.90: 95% CI: 0.71–1.12).62 Conclusive data are lacking on the
use of these agents at standard or high-dose in patients with NF-
Pan-NET with G2 or Ki67 > 10% and more aggressive scenarios.63,64
Several preclinical studies supported the development of multiki-
nase inhibitors (MKI) targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor-
receptor (VEGFR) in Pan-NET. Sunitinib is the only tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI) approved until now by the major regulatory interna-
tional agencies for the treatment of well-differentiated Pan-NET. This
is based on an improvement in the PFS versus placebo found in a
phase 3 trial conducted in 171 patients (HR 0.42: 95% CI: 0.26–0.66).
In addition to the PFS prolongation, an objective response rate of
9.3% was achieved that compared favourably with no responses
observed in the comparator arm.65 Other MKI have shown promising
data in this area like pazopanib, axitinib and lenvatinib, among others.
Genes related to PI3K-Akt–mTOR pathway such as MEN1, TSC2,
or NF-1, are found to be altered in a significant proportion of Pan-
NET.66 Based on this strong biological rationale, mTOR inhibitors
were developed such as everolimus, that in RADIANT-3, a prospective
randomised phase 3 trial, demonstrated to significantly improved PFS
compared to placebo (HR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.27–0.45) in patients with
progressive G1 and G2 Pan-NET.67 As there are no comparative stud-
ies of targeted agents, the use of sunitinib or everolimus is mostly
based on physicians' experience/preference or is driven by the safety
profile that matches patient's clinical features, comorbidities and con-
comitant therapies.
Newer data suggest that sunitinib or everolimus could also be a
potential useful tool for the management of patients with NET G3
with a Ki-67 < 55%.68,69
Patients with the VHL syndrome have a higher incidence of Pan-
NET and other tumours owing to a rare autosomal dominant heredi-
tary disorder associated with VHL gene inactivation and constitutive
activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-
2α). Belzutifan is an approved agnostic oral inhibitor of HIF-2α in the
USA, that at a dose of 120 mg once daily was associated with 90.9%
objective response rates in patients with VHL germinal-mutated loca-
lised Pan-NET70 Registration in the EU is pending, and a phase 2 trial
with belzutifan is recruiting patients with advanced GEP NET and
phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma (unselected for VHL mjutation).
Therefore, the value of Belzutifan in metastatic Pan-NET is still
unclear.
As of today, no significant activity of promising new systemic
therapies such as novel immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or anti-
body drug conjugates (ADC) has been shown in patients with Pan-
NET, probably based on the low tumour mutational burden (TMB),
noninflamed microenvironment and lack of high proliferation rates.

Recommendations
1. SSA is the recommended upfront treatment in slow-growing, SST-
positive, advanced G1 and G2 NF-Pan-NET (Level of evidence 2b:

G2 NF-Pan-NET (Level of evidence 1a: Grade of recommenda-

NF-Pan-NET (Level of evidence 3b: Grade of recommendation B).

Q7. What is the role of chemotherapy in NF-
Pan-NET?
Chemotherapy has long been used for patients with Pan-NET. Early-
generation alkylating agents (streptozotocin, chlorozotocin, doxorubi-
cin) have been overtaken by temozolomide (an oral analogue of dacar-
bazine), either alone or in combination with capecitabine (an oral
analogue of 5-fluorouracil [5-FU]). Encouraging data from retrospec-
tive studies provided the rationale for the randomised phase II ECOG-
ACRIN E2211 trial in which 144 patients with advanced low- or
intermediate-grade
Pan-NET
were
allocated
temozolomide
± capecitabine. The combination demonstrated a superior PFS, as pri-
mary endpoint (HR 0.58; p = .022).71 In addition, the combination
showed a trend to improved response rate (40% vs. 34%) and OS
(58.7 vs. 53.8 months), although this was not statistically significant.
Data by functional status are not yet available. Although O6-
methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) deficiency was asso-
ciated with greater likelihood of response, no significant correlation
was seen with PFS or OS improvement. Therefore, evaluation of

MGMT expression cannot be recommended so far for daily practice,
although it might be of interest in situations where tumour debulking
is the main therapeutic objective.
The ECOG-ACRIN E2211 study was limited to patients with Ki-
67 of up to 20% (grades 1 and 2). A recent multicentre retrospective
series72 has demonstrated a response rate of 36% in patients with
grade 3 GEP neoplasms (67% of patients had Pan-NEN, 49% were
well-differentiated;
and
92%
received
temozolomide
with
capecitabine – with 8% receiving temozolomide alone). Response
rates
(nonsignificantly)
favoured
well-differentiated
NET
(41%
vs. 26% in NEC; p = .63) and NEN with Ki-67 < 55% (39% vs. 14% if
Ki-67 > 55%; p =.014); responses were more commonly seen in
patients with Pan-NEN and in the first-line setting.
Despite the robustness of the available data and wide use in daily
practice, temozolomide has no official licensed indication for NET so
far. Streptozotocin, either in combination with 5-fluorouracil or with
doxorubicin are regimens which have been used since the 1970s
with ORR of 38% and median PFS of around 12 months in modern
trials.72,73
Patient selection favouring chemotherapy, in the setting of
several other treatment options, relies on features of high mitotic
activity (bulky disease, symptomatic disease due to high volume, or
significant tumour growth) and aims of treatment (to reduce vol-
ume of disease versus stabilisation often seen with targeted
therapies).
Limited data exist on the use of temozolomide combinations as
neoadjuvant or conversion therapy approach with a view to curative
surgery of locally advanced primary or relatively localised metastatic
Pan-NET. In a retrospective study, 10 patients with locally advanced
Pan-NET and 20 patients with potentially resectable liver metastasis
from a Pan-NET were treated with temozolomide and capecitabine.
The response rate was 43% and 26 patients (87%) underwent re-
section (primary and/or liver metastasectomy) with 63% of patients
alive at 5 years.74 It is always hard to extrapolate conclusions from
retrospective data since selection bias could be behind these figures
of activity; however, chemotherapy may facilitate surgical resection in
selected patients.
The role of chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment in Pan-NEN is
unknown and there is no robust study supporting the use of any che-
motherapy regimen after complete resection of a G1 or G2 Pan-NET.
The large number of patients required to conduct a phase 3 trial, along
with the duration of follow-up needed make the feasibility of this kind
of approach challenging and academic trials, are highly needed for this
situation.

Q8. In the setting of advanced disease, which
is the most suitable first-line systemic therapy? Which
sequence of treatments should be used?
Over the last decade, several systemic therapies have been approved
by FDA and EMA as antitumour treatments for advanced NF-Pan-
NET, including SSA,61 everolimus,67 sunitinib,65 and PRRT with
177Lutetium-DOTATATE.75 All of them were approved for patients
with progressive well differentiated Pan-NET with a Ki-67 up to 20%
even though some studies included cases of NET G3 (Ki-67 > 20%).
Chemotherapy with streptozotocin has been approved since the
1970s for Pan-NET, and more recently temozolomide + capecitabine
has been proposed as an alternative regimen as first-line.76,77
So far neither predictive factors of efficacy nor specific sequenc-
ing of therapies have been validated, therefore no true gold standard
exists as first-line therapy and therapy sequencing.
Factors influencing treatment choice can include78,79:
• Baseline tumour status (e.g., stable vs. progressive, slow- vs. fast-
growing tumours, disease-free interval in case of metachronous
metastases);
• Primary tumour site (head vs. body/tail);
• Extension of metastases (e.g., liver vs. liver + extrahepatic)
• Tumour load (especially in the liver and peritoneum)
• Ki-67 value;
• FDG-PET/CT uptake;
• Tumour-related mass-effect symptoms;
• SRI
(68Ga-PET/CT)
(negative/positive,
homogeneity,
match/
mismatch
with
morphological
imaging
and
between
68GA
and FDG)
• Potential resectability of the primary tumour and of metastatic
disease;
• Patient characteristics (age, comorbidities, performance status);
• Inherited syndrome (mainly MEN1, VHL);
• Previous treatments and ongoing cumulative toxicity;
• Goals of treatment (e.g., tumour growth control, tumour shrinkage,
debulking, QoL).
Patients with SRI-positive NF-Pan-NET with a very high liver
tumour load,80 or extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis81 who are
potentially candidates for PRRT, should be carefully evaluated within
the NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team due to the risk of toxicity
related to PRRT.
So far no published results of randomised prospective studies
comparing different therapy sequences in the setting of advanced
NF-Pan-NETs are available. The preliminary results of the randomised
phase III SEQTOR study, which compared streptozotocin +5-FU fol-

in Pan-NET patients, showed no statistically significant difference in
the primary endpoint, the one-year PFS rate.82 On the other hand, the
preliminary results of the randomised phase II noncomparative
OCLURANDOM study with PRRT and sunitinib showed a longer PFS
of PRRT (177Lu-DOTATATE) in pretreated Pan-NET patients (median
20.7 months (90% CI: 17.2–23.7) and 11.0 months (90% CI: 8.8–
12.4), respectively).50 A large retrospective multicentre Italian
nationwide study showed that second-line therapy with PRRT was
more effective in terms of PFS than chemotherapy or everolimus or
sunitinib in patients with GEP-NET (including NF-Pan-NET), which
was confirmed in the Pan-NET and nonfunctioning subgroups.10
Two ongoing international phase III studies are exploring the effi-
cacy of PRRT in advanced GEP-NET with high Ki-67 index (10%–
55%), in comparison with octreotide LAR 60 mg/q4w as first-line
(NETTER-2 trial, NCT03972488) or in comparison with chemother-

Q9. Is there a specific work-up in MEN1
patients?
The molecular bases of NF-Pan-NET tumorigenesis is not well under-
stood and although 90% of cases are sporadic a minority may be
included in the context of important genetic syndromes such as
MEN1, VHL and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) syndrome.83 A sep-
arate ENETS guidance paper on MEN1 syndrome is currently being
worked on at the same time as this manuscript.
MEN1 is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited endocrine tumour
predisposition syndrome, caused by germline heterozygous mutations
in the MEN1 tumour suppressor gene, located on chromosome
11q13. The MEN1 gene encodes the menin protein involved in the
regulation of gene transcription and mutation carriers will have clinical
manifestations by the age of 50 years. The syndrome is associated
with parathyroid adenomas, duodenopancreatic NET and anterior
pituitary adenomas with a lifetime prevalence of 80% for NF-Pan-
NET. MEN1 syndrome associates less frequently with thymic, lung
and gastric NET and other tumours, and it is thus important to moni-
tor patients for other neoplasms. Early recognition of relatives with
MEN1 syndrome is of outmost importance due to 50% probability of
first line family members being carriers and also in the light of possible
genetic anticipation.84
Pan-NET arising in the context of MEN1 syndrome are usually
multiple, nonfunctioning and may develop early in the second decade
of life.85 The current state of evidence suggests initial close follow up
with MRI to assess growth rate alternating with EUS. SRI-PET may be
carried out when it may change management such as in NF-Pan-NET
>1 cm for detection of occult metastases or before interventions are
considered.86,87
Several
studies
have
indicated
that
MEN1-associated
NF-
Pan-NET usually exhibit a low propensity to grow and lesions <2 cm
can be simply followed up by observation. If they are NET G2-G3,
have lymph node metastases and are >3 cm in diameter, surgical exci-
sion is then considered as they may display metastatic potential.88 For
lesions between 2 and 3 cm there is uncertainty, and more studies are
required prior to being able to make recommendations. ENETS recom-
mends resecting MEN1-related NF-Pan-NET with a diameter of more
than 2 cm, with a yearly size increment in diameter of more than

There are still controversies related to issues of surgical treatment
of Pan-NET, such as to what extent enucleation, lymph node sam-
pling, and vascular reconstruction are beneficial for the oncologic out-
come particularly in MEN1 patients and in tumours 1–2 cm in
diameter. A comparison between sporadic and MEN1-related NF-
Pan-NET has been previously presented showing several similarities
such as prognostic factors (tumour size, grade, and cumulative methyl-
ation index) but also differences (younger age, multifocality and other
concomitant tumours).89

Recommendations
1. For MEN1 patients, NF-Pan-NET ≤2 cm may be observed, while
surgical resection is advised for NF-Pan-NET >2 cm (Level of evi-
dence 2: Grade of recommendation B).
2. Management decisions for selected NF-Pan-NET 2–3 cm and for
grade 2 NF-Pan-NET should be made case-by-case within a NET-
dedicated multidisciplinary team (Level of evidence 3: Grade of

FOLLOW-UP
4.1
|
Q10. What is the recommended follow-up in
NF-Pan- NET?
The main objective of the follow-up is to propose an effective (ideally,
curative) treatment in cases of recurrence.
As metachronous metastatic recurrence may occur very late,
patients must be informed about the need for prolonged surveillance
(at least 20 years, even lifelong), although intervals are progressively
lengthened.90
1. In patients with NF-Pan-NET (initially metastatic or not) undergo-
ing surgical resection with curative intent:
 Morphological imaging and SST-PET/CT should be performed
3 to 6 months after surgery, then morphological imaging should
be performed every 6 to 12 months for 5 years, then every 12–
24 months for 10 years and then every 5 years. The intensity of
follow-up can be modulated according to prognostic factors,
notably
tumour
grade,
stage,
R0/R1
resection
and
life
expectancy.91
 Abdominal MRI including diffusion-weighted sequences are
preferred. MRI is nonionising and more sensitive than CT-scan
for the detection of small liver metastases.32 Hence, abdominal
MRI may be used in alternance with thoracoabdominal-pelvic
CT-scan, which appropriately evaluates extra-hepatic lesions.
 Assessment of local control after locoregional therapies for
example, of liver metastases should be done every 3 months
during the first 2 years with dedicated liver imaging (prefera-
bly MRI).
 SRI (preferably using PET/CT instead of scintigraphy/SPECT)
should be performed every 1 to 2 years if clinically indicated
because of its superior sensitivity in regions like skeleton, heart
and breast as compared to CT, although its role for surveillance
has never been demonstrated. It is recommended if morphologi-
cal imaging suspects recurrence.28
 No biological marker is validated for follow-up. Nonetheless,
the plasma level of CgA correlates with tumour burden and can
be monitored, using the same assay kit throughout the follow-
up.92 NSE levels in patients with higher grade (NET G3) can be
useful.
2. In patients with nonresected metastatic NF-Pan-NET
 Imaging should be performed at 3 months and then every 3–
6 months for 2 years, the interval can then be lengthened to
6 or even 12 months if the disease remains stable.
 SST-PET/CT should be performed every 1–2 years, if clinically
indicated.
 The preferred imaging modality should be chosen on a case-
by-case basis, depending on its ability to show target lesions
and to cover the potential sites of new metastases; for example
MRI, especially using hepatocyte-specific contrast material,93,94
usually provides better reproducibility of measurements of liver
metastases, and is more sensitive for detection of small
liver lesions than CT.32
 The evaluation of tumour evolution currently relies on RECIST
1.1 cutoffs for change in tumour size.95 Throughout the treat-
ment, the imaging modality should not be changed, neither the
type of MR contrast material (extracellular versus hepatocyte
specific), timing of contrast series, or SRI-tracer.93,94 Tumour
response to treatment is evaluated by comparing one scan with
that performed at baseline (treatment initiation ± 1 month) or,
in case of growth, with that performed at the best response
(nadir), respectively.
 Plasma CgA level can be monitored using the same assay kit
throughout the follow-up. However, an isolated rise in CgA is
not an indication to change the treatment if there is no evi-
dence of progression but may suggest closer follow-up, includ-
ing SRI.92
3. Late iatrogenic adverse events must be screened for, notably renal
dysfunction (streptozotocin or PRRT), heart failure (sunitinib, doxo-
rubicin) and bone marrow involvement (PRRT, alkylating agents).96

Recommendations
1. Routine imaging follow-up consists of morphological imaging using
contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis or, taking
the cumulative radiation exposure of CT during the long follow-up
period into account, Chest CT plus whole abdominal MRI every

6 to 12 months after curative treatment for 5 years, then
every 12–24 months for 10 years and then every 5 years (Level of
evidence 5: Grade of recommendation B).
2. SST-PET/CT should be performed at 3–6 months (if no prethera-
peutic scan had been performed) and every 1–2 years after cura-
tive treatment, if clinically indicated (Level of evidence 5: Grade of
recommendation C). It is recommended if morphological imaging sus-
pects recurrence (Level of evidence 2a: Grade of recommendation B).
3. Imaging follow-up of nonresected patients for RECIST-adapted
evaluation of tumour growth should be performed every 3–
6 months for 2 years and if stable every 6–12 months thereafter
(Level of evidence 3a: Grade of recommendation B), combined
with SST-PET/CT every 1–2 years if clinically indicated (Level of

SUMMARY
This ENETS guidance paper provides up-to-date practical advice on
the NF-Pan-NET diagnosis and treatment.
Management of NF-Pan-NET patients requires a NET-dedicated
MDT decision. ENETS Centres of Excellence should be strongly con-
sidered to be involved in the diagnostic-therapeutic strategy of these
patients. Further studies are needed to fulfil the unmet needs in this
field focusing on prognostic molecular markers, dilemmas concerning
the selection of a therapeutic approach as well as the sequence of
their use to achieve success in the management of NF-Pan-NET
patients.
