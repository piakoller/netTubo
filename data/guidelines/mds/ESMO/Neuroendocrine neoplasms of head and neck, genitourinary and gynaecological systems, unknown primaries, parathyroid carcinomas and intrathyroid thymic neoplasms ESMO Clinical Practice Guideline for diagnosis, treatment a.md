NEUROENDOCRINE NEOPLASMS
Incidence and epidemiology
Neuroendocrine
neoplasms
(NENs)
encompass
well-
differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) and poorly
differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). The pri-
mary tumour site for NENs remains unidentiﬁed in 13%-20%
of cases.1 NENs account for w8% of unknown primary
(UKP) malignancies and UKP-NENs represent the fourth
most common NEN with an increasing incidence of 8.4 per
million, representing 10%-15% of NETs and NECs.1,2
Genitourinary and gynaecological (GUGy)-NENs account
for 1%-2% of GUGy malignancies, 12% of NECs and 4% of
NETs.3 Their estimated incidence in Europe is 0.5-1 per
million.4 GUGy-NENs arise from the bladder, kidney, ureter,
ovary, cervix, endometrium, prostate, testis or presacral
space5-7 (see Section 1 of the Supplementary Material,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.1036
64).
NENs arising from the head and neck (HN) account for
<1% of HN malignancies, 2% of NECs and 0.6% of NETs.4
Their estimated incidence in Europe is 0.1-0.15 per
million.4 HN-NENs arise most frequently from the larynx8
followed by the middle ear9 and sinonasal tract10 (see
Section 1 of the Supplementary Material, available at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).
Diagnosis and pathological classiﬁcation
Pathological classiﬁcation. Classiﬁcation of NENs relies on
differentiation (well or poorly differentiated), presence or
absence of necrosis and grade (G) assessed by Ki-67 index
and/or mitotic count (see Table 1 and Section 2 of the
Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).11
Immunohistochemistry
(IHC) biomarkers may help to identify primary sites12,13 (see
Supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). For accurate diagnosis, a
comprehensive pathology report should include unequivo-
cal grading with morphological differentiation, mitotic
count and Ki-67 index. The International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC)eWorld Health Organization
(WHO) 2018 consensus terminology is used when referring

to NENs (irrespective of their primary site), together with
the organ-speciﬁc WHO classiﬁcation (see Table 1).14 In
addition, a general template for reporting biopsies has been
developed.15
Clinical diagnosis. The objective of the initial diagnostic
work-up of UKP-NENs is to identify the occult primary
tumour. Metastatic patterns can be indicative of primary
tumour location. The most common site for the occult pri-
mary is the ileum followed by the pancreas.16 Ileal NETs
often present as a mesenteric mass on computed tomog-
raphy (CT).16 Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging (SRI)
with
gallium-68-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-
tetraacetic acid-labelled somatostatin analogue ([68Ga]Ga-
DOTA-SSA)epositron emission tomography (PET)eCT is the
most sensitive technique for NETs, detecting an occult pri-
mary in 61% of cases.17 If SRI is uninformative, [18F]
F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)ePETeCT and endoscopy
techniques can be useful (see Supplementary Table S1,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.
103664, and Section 3 of the Supplementary Material,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.
103664).
For
NECs,
[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose
(FDG)ePETeCT may be used. The presence of secretory
syndromes and elevated hormone levels may also facilitate
identiﬁcation of the primary NET. A minimum panel of
peptide
hormones
should
be
measured
in
patients
with
UKP-NETs
[calcitonin,
metanephrines
and
5-
hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)]. Other hormones may
be measured depending on symptoms (see Supplementary
Table S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.

2024.103664). Chromogranin A has demonstrated a sensi-
tivity of 71% and speciﬁcity of 84%-85% for the detection of
gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs.18
It is important to distinguish between primary GUGy-
NETs and metastasis in the GUGy system from primary tu-
mours in another site. Indeed, ovarian, testicular and renal
metastases occur in patients with GEP or lung NETs.
Symptoms result from local inﬁltration in patients with
more aggressive GUGy-NENs and performance status (PS)
deterioration. Less than 15% of GUGy-NETs present with
hormone-related symptoms (mostly carcinoid syndrome).1
HN-NENs induce non-speciﬁc symptoms such as hoarse-
ness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, nasal obstruction, epistaxis and
conductive hearing loss.19,20 Laryngeal NENs arise from the
supraglottic region in 85% of cases.8 Middle-ear NENs appear
as a retrotympanic mass extending into the ossicles, mastoid,
auditory canal and Eustachian tube.9,19 Sinonasal NENs occur
in the ethmoid (64% of cases), nasal cavity (32%) and maxil-
lary sinus (14%). The most common metastatic sites are the
lymph nodes, lungs, liver and bones.21 Skin metastases can be
extremely painful and suggestive of laryngeal NETs.22 Func-
tional syndromes are rare and include carcinoid syndrome,
syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hor-
mone, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome and
LamberteEaton myasthenic syndrome.23
Recommendations
 Diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients
with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs should be discussed in a
NEN multidisciplinary tumour board (MTB) [V, A].
 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs should be classiﬁed and
graded according to the common IARCeWHO 2018
consensus classiﬁcation together with the organ-speciﬁc
WHO classiﬁcation [V, A].
 For UKP-NETs, IHC should be carried out to exclude para-
gangliomas (cytokeratin) and to identify the primary [as a
minimum: thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and
caudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX-2)]. Calcitonin, serotonin
and other IHC markers may be used [IV, B].
 In patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, secretory syn-
dromes should be diagnosed based on hormone-related
symptoms. As a minimum, metanephrines, 5-HIAA and
calcitonin should be measured in those with UKP-NETs
[V, A].
 For UKP-NETs, cross-sectional imaging may identify meta-
static patterns suggestive of a primary site (e.g. a mesen-
teric mass indicative of an ileal NET) [IV, A]. Endoscopy

and endoscopic ultrasound (US) are recommended to
identify pancreatic primaries [V, A].
 SRIePET is recommended for G1-2 UKP-NETs to visualise
the primary tumour [IV, A]. FDGePETeCT may be helpful
in NENs with a higher proliferation index (G3 NETs
and NECs) [V, B]. [18F]F-DOPAePETeCT may also detect
an ileum primary, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma
in patients with UKP-NETs [V, B].
 In patients with UKP-NECs, searches for the primary
should not delay treatment intervention, apart from cuta-
neous examination for Merkel-cell carcinoma and IHC for
cytokeratin 20 and Merkel-cell polyomavirus, if available
[V, A].
Staging and risk assessment
Adequate staging of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs relies on
cross-sectional imaging and nuclear medicine techniques.
CT scans are effective for the detection of lung metastases
whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is better for
liver and bone metastases. MRI is also preferred in young
patients as radiation exposure is lower. SRI has a high
sensitivity for NETs and should be part of the initial work-
up. SSTR scintigraphy is less sensitive and should only be
carried out when SRIePETeCT is not available. Whole body
CT, or FDGePETeCT in case of limited tumour burden, are
recommended for the staging of G2-3 NETs and NECs.24
Staging of middle-ear HN-NENs is based on the system
proposed by Marinelli et al.19 while staging of GUGy- and
HN-NENs is based on the eighth edition of the Union for
International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM (tumourenodee
metastasis) classiﬁcation25 (see Supplementary Tables S2-
S10, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.
103664). There is no staging classiﬁcation for UKP-NENs
unless an occult primary is identiﬁed by the initial diag-
nostic work-up.
Prognosis for all NENs relies on pathological grading and
staging. In patients with metastases, differentiation, WHO
grade, age, PS, tumour burden, SRI and/or FDG uptake, the
presence of a functional syndrome at baseline and tumour
growth rate should be considered for optimal risk assessment.
Recommendations
 CT and/or MRI are recommended for staging. MRI should
be mainly considered in young patients to reduce irradi-
ation anddusing late arterial phase imagingdimprove
detection of hepatic, pancreatic, brain and bone NETs
[III, A].
 SRIePET is recommended for initial and preoperative
staging, and when indicated for restaging [V, A].
 FDGePETeCT can be used for staging G2-3 NETs and
NECs [IV, B].
 Major independent prognostic factors are disease stage
(TNM) and pathological features including differentiation
and WHO grade [IV, A]. Age, PS, tumour burden, the pres-
ence of functional syndromes and tumour growth rate
are additional prognostic factors [IV, B].
Management of local and locoregional disease
Patients with UKP-NENs may present with lymph node
metastases without the detection of a primary tumour or
distant metastases. For G1-3 UKP-NETs, radical resection of
locoregional
disease
is the
preferred
treatment
(see
Figure 1). While searching for an occult primary, the site of
lymph node metastasis may guide surgical exploration (e.g.
an involved mesenteric node is suggestive of an ileal pri-
mary). There is no evidence to support adjuvant therapy
following curative resection of NETs. For UKP-NECs, down-
staging of locoregional disease with chemotherapy (ChT)
and/or radiotherapy (RT) may be considered before surgery.
Some patients with NECs, particularly with isolated inguinal
or neck nodes, may have prolonged disease control and
survival following multimodal treatment including sur-
gery.26 In this setting, Merkel-cell carcinoma should be ruled
out. It is unclear whether post-operative treatment of NECs
improves
outcomes,
but
four cycles of carboplatine
etoposide may be considered, particularly if neoadjuvant
ChT has not been used.27
There are no prospective data on the management of
local and locoregional disease in patients with GUGy-NENs.
Recommendations are therefore extrapolated from site-
speciﬁc ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs).28 For
GUGy-NETs,
upfront
radical
surgery
without
adjuvant
treatment is recommended when feasible (see Figure 2);
however, a conservative surgical approach should be dis-
cussed whenever possible, particularly for low-grade local-
ised NETs. The role of adjuvant therapy for G3 GUGy-NETs is
also unknown. For GUGy-NECs, multimodal therapy should
always be discussed for localised disease. Further details
regarding the management of local and locoregional GUGy-
NENs are available in Section 4 of the Supplementary
Material, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.
2024.103664.
For HN-NENs, locoregional treatment depends on the
primary site (see Figure 3). In the larynx, NETs are mainly
supraglottic and their sensitivity to ChT and RT may be low.
Based
on
retrospective
data,
radical
resection
after
completion of whole body imaging (including PETeCT) is
recommended whenever possible with homolateral neck
dissection, as it may lower the risk of regional lymph node
recurrence.8 Post-operative RT should be discussed in a
multidisciplinary meeting, particularly for G2 NETs.8 For
laryngeal NECs, treatment relies mainly on ChT and RT8;
surgery may be discussed in selected cases.29 For sinonasal
NETs, surgery was associated with longer survival in retro-
spective series.30,31 The role of prophylactic neck dissection
is unknown. Post-operative RT should be discussed but
there is no evidence that it prevents locoregional relapse.
For sinonasal NECs, treatment should be multimodal.
Retrospective data suggest that induction ChT is beneﬁ-
cial,10 in combination with RT in most cases and surgery in
selected cases.21,31 Most middle-ear tumours are NETs.
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment,19,32 but complete
resection with no tumour at the margin (R0) is challenging
and there is a risk of locoregional relapse when ossicles are

involved. There are no data on post-operative RT; however,
RT may be discussed for patients with a higher risk of
relapse due to adherence to important neurovascular
structures. RT might prevent extension to the skull base and
subsequent
debilitating
complications.
This
must
be
balanced against the risk of long-term RT-induced toxicity.
Recommendations
 For patients with UKP-NETs with locoregional disease, the
aim of surgical resection with exploration is to identify
and treat the primary tumour with microscopic radical
intent [V, A].
 For GUGy-NETs, surgery of the primary tumour and nodes
with microscopic radical intent (according to site-speciﬁc
ESMO CPGs) is the treatment of choice for local and
locoregional disease, irrespective of grade [V, A]. A con-
servative surgical approach should be discussed when-
ever feasible, particularly in low-grade, early-stage NETs
[V, B].
 For laryngeal and sinonasal NETs, surgery of the primary
tumour with microscopic radical intent and homolateral
therapeutic neck dissection is recommended whenever
possible [IV, A].
 Adjuvant treatment cannot be recommended for UKP-
NETs [V, D] but adjuvant RT may be discussed for GUGy-
NETs in patients with microscopic (R1) or macroscopic
(R2) tumour at the margin and/or G3 disease [V, C].
 For HN-NETs, adjuvant RT may be discussed after radical
resection, particularly in case of locoregional spread,
non-R0 resection and G2 disease; however, the beneﬁt
in terms of local control is unknown [V, C].
 For locoregional sinonasal NECs, neoadjuvant ChT with
platinumeetoposide may be considered before surgical
resection [IV, C].
 For NECs treated with radical surgery, adjuvant therapy
with four cycles of platinumeetoposide may be consid-
ered [V, B].
 Neoadjuvant ChT may be an option for UKP- and GUGy-
NECs [V, C].
 Combining RT with ChT is recommended for HN-NECs [IV,
A] and could be discussed for UKP- and GUGy-NECs as
deﬁnitive or (neo)adjuvant treatment [V, C].
Management of advanced and metastatic disease
For UKP-NETs there are few clinical trials with low patient
numbers and for UKP-NECs there are only retrospective

studies; available data are summarised in Section 5 of the
Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664. For advanced or metastatic
GUGy- and HN-NENs, neither retrospective nor prospective
studies are available. Thus, recommendations for the man-
agement of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs are based on the
management of NENs of GEP or lung origin and so systemic
treatments approved for GEP-NETs are used off-label in this
setting.28 When an occult primary is identiﬁed or suspected
(such as a mesenteric mass from an ileal NET), its man-
agement should follow the dedicated guideline.
Treatment decisions (see Figure 4) should be based on
comprehensive multidisciplinary characterisation of the
tumour (see ‘Staging and risk assessment’). In particular,
WHO grade, differentiation (well versus poor),33 SSTR status
based on SRIePETeCT24 and presence of a functional syn-
drome should be considered.
Surgery and locoregional therapies. Surgery should be
discussed
for
slowly
proliferating
(oligo)metastatic
tumours in patients with G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs;
this includes surgical exploration for occult primary
identiﬁcation in case of UKP-NETs.34 Metastatic spread in
HN-NETs frequently involves the skin, particularly in those
arising from the larynx.20,22 Skin metastases are usually
multiple and small in size, causing hard-to-treat pain and
discomfort, which affects patients’ quality of life. In most
cases, they are resistant to systemic treatment. Repeated
locoregional therapies may be used, including surgical
resection, electrochemotherapy35 and RT for the largest
tumours.22
Somatostatin analogues. Two phase III trials [CLARINET
(lanreotide) and PROMID (octreotide)] have reported longer
progression-free survival (PFS) or time to progression with
somatostatin analogue (SSA) treatment compared with
placebo in patients with metastatic GEP-NETs. Both studies
included some patients with UKP-NETs but none with GUGy-
or HN-NETs.36,37 Extrapolating the results from CLARINET
and PROMID, SSAs may be recommended for tumour

or slowly progressive NETs.38
Management of functional syndromes. SSAs are recom-
mended as ﬁrst-line therapy for carcinoid syndrome and
other functional syndromes (Figure 5). Beyond SSAs, studies
exploring the role of telotristat ethyl39 or interferon-a (IFN-
a)40 for carcinoid syndrome control included patients with
any primary tumour site so their use is also applicable to
UKP-NETs. No data are available on the treatment of
carcinoid syndrome associated with GUGy- or HN-NETs.
Management of carcinoid syndrome should follow the Eu-
ropean Neuroendocrine Tumor Society 2022 guidance pa-
per on carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid heart disease41;
management of Cushing syndrome should follow the ESMO
CPG on lung and thymic carcinoids.28
Targeted therapy. Based on data from the RADIANT-2,42
RADIANT-343 and RADIANT-444 trials (NETs of various pri-
maries), everolimus monotherapy may be considered as
ﬁrst-line treatment for SSTR-negative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and
HN-NETs, or as second-line treatment after SSAs in patients
with progressive disease. The RADIANT studies, however,
included only 36 patients with UKP-NETs and no patients
with GUGy- or HN-NETs. Based on the randomised CABI-
NET,45 AXINET46 and SANET-ep47 trials, antiangiogenic
multikinase inhibitors (MKIs) may be considered as alter-
natives to everolimus for ﬁrst-line treatment of SSTR-
negative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NETs, or for second-
line treatment after SSAs in patients with progressive dis-
ease. These studies included 34-49 patients with UKP-NETs
or NETs of other origin not otherwise speciﬁed (see Sec-
tion 5 of the Supplementary Material, available at https://
doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).
ChT. In patients with progressive G2 (Ki-67 >10%) and G3
NETs, alkylating agent-based and oxaliplatin-based ChT
regimens may be considered. Most data for management of
G3 NETs with these regimens are from patients with
pancreatic NETs, with response rates of up to 30% and
median PFS of 8-16 months.48 Loss of O-6-methylguanine-
DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression or promoter
hypermethylation may prompt use of alkylating agent-
based ChT (see Section 5 of the Supplementary Material,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.
103664).49,50 For the management of NECs, ﬁrst-line
carboplatineetoposide or cisplatineetoposide is recom-
mended based on retrospective series showing response
rates of 40%-60%, median PFS of 4-6 months and median
overall survival (OS) of 12 months.2,10,21,29,51 Carboplatine
etoposide or cisplatineetoposide should not be used for
well-differentiated NETs, regardless of grade.33,51

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Patients with UKP-,
GUGy- and HN-NETs were excluded from the randomised
phase III NETTER-1 study, which evaluated peptide receptor
radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [177Lu]Lutetium-DOTA-
Tyr3-octreotate in patients with mid-gut NETs.52 Retro-
spective studies have reported equivalent efﬁcacy with
PRRT in patients with UKP-NETs versus other primaries
(w30% response rate and PFS of 20-25 months), thereby
supporting its use.53 There are no retrospective studies on
the use of PRRT in GUGy- or HN-NETs. PRRT may be an
option for patients with SSTR-positive UKP-, GUGy- or HN-
NETs who have progressed under SSA treatment.
Precision medicine. The ESMO Precision Medicine Working
Group recommends determination of tumour mutational
burden (TMB) in NENs,54 following results from the TMB-high
cohort of the KEYNOTE-158 basket trial of pembrolizumab.55
In this study, two of ﬁve patients with TMB-high NENs had a
response (40% response rate compared with 1% in those
with non-TMB-high NENs); however, no immunotherapy is
approved in Europe for TMB-high tumours and the avail-
ability of next-generation sequencing for patients with NENs

reported in UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs. Molecular proﬁling,

mation to guide agnostic clinical trials and/or compassionate

ommended if the disease is amenable to R0 resection
and/or for debulking to control hormonal syndromes in
functional NETs [V, A].
 SSAs are the ﬁrst-line treatment for patients with carci-
noid syndrome [IV, A]. In case of uncontrolled carcinoid
syndrome, telotristat ethyl (for syndrome control) [I, B],
the combination of an SSA with IFN-a [II, B], PRRT [IV,

adrenalectomy is recommended in refractory cases [V, A].
 Given the rarity of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NETs, enrolment
of patients in clinical trials is recommended whenever
possible [V, A].
 SSAs are recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for tumour
growth control in advanced, SSTR-positive UKP-, GUGy-

Follow-up, long-term implications and survivorship
Follow-up of patients with metastatic UKP-, GUGy- and HN-
NENs should be personalised [based on morphology (well
versus poorly differentiated), WHO grade, staging, presence
of residual disease or metastases, and SRI or FDGePET
positivity] and include imaging and monitoring of clinical
symptoms and biochemical parameters. With the exception
of UKP-NENs (see Section 6 of the Supplementary Material,
available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664),
there are no data on long-term follow-up. Follow-up carries
the risk of excessive radiation exposure, so low-dose CT (for
lung metastases) or MRI should be used whenever possible,
especially in patients for whom prolonged follow-up is
anticipated. There is a consensus for the use of molecular
imaging for SSTR-positive NETs, especially SRI with [68Ga]Ga-
DOTA-SSAePETeCT, at initial staging and for post-surgical
restaging, but not for routine follow-up.24 Molecular imag-
ing may play a role, however, in the follow-up of secondary
lesions that are hard to evaluate with conventional imaging,
such as peritoneal carcinomatosis and bone metastases.
Recommendations
 For patients with completely resected G1 and low G2 (Ki-
67 <10%) UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-
dose CT or MRI is recommended every 6 months for
2 years, annually for years 3-5 and every second year
thereafter [V, C].
 For patients with completely resected G2 (Ki-67 10%)
and G3 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-
dose CT or MRI is recommended every 3 months for
2 years, every 6 months in year 3, annually for years
4-5 and every second year thereafter [V, C].
 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or
HN-NECs,
follow-up
should
be
carried
out
every
2-3 months for 2 years, every 6 months in year 3 and
then discussed on a case-by-case basis thereafter [V, C].
 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or HN-
NENs, the best molecular imaging technique (according to
SRIePET and/or FDGePETeCT positivity at initial staging)
is recommended 6 months after resection and then in
case of unclear or abnormal imaging results [V, C].
 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual
or metastatic disease, restaging is recommended every
4-6 months [G1 and low G2 (Ki-67 <10%) NETs] or every
3-4 months [G2 (Ki-67 10%) and G3 NETs]; the interval
can be increased in case of stable disease [V, C].
 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual or
metastatic disease, systematic follow-up using PET imaging
is not recommended but may be considered in case of
doubtful or abnormal imaging results, increasing bio-
markers, clinical suspicion of new metastasis (particularly
in the bone) and/or depending on the metastatic sites
and their measurability using conventional imaging, espe-
cially when locoregional therapies are discussed [V, C].

ment, psychosocial support and rehabilitation [II, B].
PARATHYROID CARCINOMA
Incidence and epidemiology
Parathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare neoplasm, accounting
for <1% of primary hyperparathyroidism cases.56 PC affects
male and female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of
50 years. PC occurs as a sporadic form, or less frequently as
familial forms such as hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour
syndrome (HPT-JT; w15% of cases) linked to a germline
mutation in the CDC73/HRPT2 gene.57 Rarely, it can occur as
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 (MEN1) or type
2A (MEN2A).58 Even in the absence of a family history,
20%-40% of patients with apparently sporadic PC have a
germline CDC73 mutation.58,59
Diagnosis, pathology and molecular biology
Diagnosis.
Clinical presentation. PC can be suspected in patients
who present with severe primary hyperparathyroidism
characterised by severe hypercalcaemia-related symptoms
and markedly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.
Less than 10% of patients have normal serum calcium and
PTH levels and present with a non-functional PC with only
local symptoms, such as a palpable cervical mass, hoarse-
ness, dysphagia or dyspnoea.60
Laboratory studies. Most patients with PC have markedly
high levels of calcium (>14 mg/dl or 3.5 mmol/l) and non-
suppressed intact PTH 1-84 molecule (3-10 times above the
upper limit of normal). The combined presence of high
serum calcium (>3 mmol/l) and a parathyroid lesion >3 cm
(the so-called ‘>3, >3 rule’), should raise suspicion of PC.
Some patients with PC may overproduce N-terminal PTH
fragment and have elevated serum and urinary levels of
human chorionic gonadotropin; their determination could
be useful for differential diagnosis with benign adenoma,
although this has only been tested in a small series.61
Imaging. Neck US is the ﬁrst-line imaging technique for
the diagnosis of parathyroid lesions. Its sensitivity varies
from 67% to 96% with a positive predictive value of 89.7%-
97%62; however, there are no speciﬁc patterns of malig-
nancy (see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.
103664). Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with cytology and
washout PTH measurement can help to differentiate from
lesions of other origins (e.g. thyroid, distant metastases
from other tumours).63 Complications associated with the
FNA procedure (including occasional seeding) are rare.64
Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI can be used in highly
suspicious cases to evaluate inﬁltration of surrounding tissue
but are not routinely carried out for differential diagnosis.65
Parathyroid
scintigraphy
with
[99mTc]Tc-sesta-methox-
yisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) single-photon emission CT (SPECT)
or SPECTeCT, in combination with neck US, is the procedure
of choice for preoperative identiﬁcation of hyperfunctioning
parathyroids. During initial PC evaluation, the sensitivity and
diagnostic accuracy of [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI scintigraphy are

80% when used with neck US or CT. Nevertheless, there are
no clear scintigraphic parameters that allow a real preoper-
ative differential diagnosis between PC and adenoma.
PET procedures such as [11C]-methionineePETeCT and
[18F]-cholineePETeCT are effective for the diagnosis of pri-
mary hyperparathyroidism but their added value in the dif-
ferential diagnosis between PC and adenoma is unknown.66
Pathology. Histological diagnosis of PC is based on the 2022
WHO classiﬁcation criteria: (i) vascular invasion; (ii) lymphatic
invasion; (iii) perineural (intraneural) invasion; (iv) local ma-
lignant invasion into adjacent anatomical structures; or (v)
histologically or cytologically documented metastatic disease.
The morphology of PC is usually reminiscent of parathyroid
adenoma or hyperplasia.67,68 Features suggestive of malig-
nancy and warranting a diagnosis of atypical adenoma [also
called parathyroid neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential
or atypical parathyroid tumour (APT)] are macroscopically
evident necrosis, size >3 cm, weight >500 mg, mitotic index
>5 mitoses/2 mm2 and the presence of atypical mitosis67,69
(see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Some rare
variants have been described, including oncocytic carcinomas
and carcinosarcomas with more aggressive behaviour.70,71
Although PC generally shows a higher proliferation index
(Ki-67 6%-9% compared with <4% in adenoma), there is no
predeﬁned Ki-67 cut-off to support or exclude a PC diagnosis.
The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)
has issued a dataset on PC and APT that covers PC grading,
considering it high grade in the presence of sheets of pleo-
morphic enlarged nuclei, coagulative necrosis, abnormal
mitosis and/or increased proliferation rate.69
Molecular biology. The most frequent molecular alteration
in PC is on the CDC73 gene (40%-50% of cases). Phospha-
tidylinositol-3-kinase
(PI3K)eprotein
kinase
b
(AKT)e
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the most
frequently altered pathway (40%-80% of cases).65,72,73 IHC
evaluation of paraﬁbromin loss of expression to identify a
double-hit inactivation of the CDC73 gene is a recognised
ancillary diagnostic method for malignancy, as is evaluation
of loss of p27, other types of cyclins or cell cycle regulators,
galectin-3 and protein gene product 9.5.69,74
Recommendations
 Genetic testing for germline CDC73 mutation should be
carried out to rule out HPT-JT in all patients with PC,
including those without a family history [IV, A].
 The combined presence of markedly elevated serum cal-
cium [>12 mg/dl (>3 mmol/l)] and parathyroid lesions
>3 cm should raise suspicion of PC [IV, B].
 US of the neck should be carried out to assess lesions sus-
picious for PC [IV, A].
 Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are used to evaluate
locoregional invasion before planning surgery [V, A].
 FNA cytology and washout PTH measurements can be
used to differentiate PC from other neck or thyroid nod-
ules but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [V, C].
 [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBIeSPECT may be useful for the diag-
nosis of PC but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [IV, C].
 PC pathology reporting should follow the 2022 WHO clas-
siﬁcation (ﬁfth edition) and ICCR template [IV, A].
Staging and risk assessment
The prognosis for patients with PC is variable, with 5- and 10-
year OS rates after surgery of w80% and 40%-80%, respec-
tively. Good prognosis is associated with early diagnosis and
radicality of initial surgery, whereas poor prognosis is mainly
related to older age and the presence of lymph node me-
tastases.75-79
Staging is based on the eighth edition of the American
Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system (see
Supplementary Table S11, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).80 Only 15%-30% of patients
have level VI lymph node metastases and one-third have
distant metastases, most commonly in the lung, liver or
bone. The detection of locoregional or distant metastases is
based on neck US, thoracic and abdominal CT, or MRI.
Among nuclear medicine techniques, total body acquisi-
tion with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI can identify possible extra-
cervical uptake and unexpected lesions. FDGePETeCT can
also be applied as PC generally shows high FDG uptake. It
can be used to complement conventional imaging in the
initial staging and for residual or relapsing disease, albeit
based on limited data.81 Other PET tracers such as [11C]-
methionineePETeCT and [18F]-cholineePETeCT have not
been validated for routine staging of PC.66,81,82
Recommendations
 PC staging should follow the eighth edition of the AJCC
TNM system [IV, A].
 Cross-sectional imaging is the reference method [V, A] but
additional FDGePETeCT may improve staging accuracy
[IV, C].
Management of local and locoregional disease
Management of hypercalcaemia. Medical management of
hypercalcaemia is the main treatment for patients awaiting
surgery and those with inoperable PC. Cinacalcet, a potent
second-generation calcium mimetic, is effective for con-
trolling hypercalcaemia in patients with inoperable or
persistent disease.83,84 The greatest reductions in calcium
were reported in patients with the highest serum calcium
levels before therapy. The cornerstones of treatment for
severe or symptomatic hypercalcaemia are intravenous sa-
line hydration and bisphosphonate administration (see
Section 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).
Surgery. Surgery is the recommended ﬁrst-line treatment
for PC (Figure 6).85 Inadequate and non-radical surgery
represent the strongest prognostic factors for recurrence
and mortality. In case of high suspicion of PC, en bloc
removal of the parathyroid lesion avoiding capsule rupture
and local seeding, homolateral thyroid lobo-isthmectomy
and central node dissection are recommended.86

RT. Analysis of data from the National Cancer Database
identiﬁed 885 patients with PC who underwent surgery
between 2004 and 2016, including 126 (14.2%) who also
received external beam RT. The latter group had a higher
frequency of extensive regional disease, nodal metastases
and residual microscopic disease. The 5-year OS rate was
85.3% with a median follow-up of 60.8 months. RT was not
associated with a difference in OS based on multivariate
analysis87; however, small series from highly specialised
tertiary centres have reported lower locoregional relapse
rates in patients undergoing adjuvant RT,88-90 particularly in
patients with R1 or R2 resection.90 Although not recom-
mended for all patients, adjuvant RT should be discussed in
the case of R1 or R2 resection and/or lymph node metas-
tasis (Nþ) and/or persistent hypercalcaemia.
Recommendations
 Medical treatment of hypercalcaemia is required before
surgery [V, A].
 Cinacalcet is recommended to control hypercalcaemia [II,
A].
 Hydration with saline infusion, at a starting dose of 200-
500 ml/h, is the ﬁrst step in the treatment of severe or
symptomatic hypercalcaemia [IV, A].
 The bone antiresorptive drug zoledronic acid is recom-
mended as ﬁrst-line treatment and should be preferred
over pamidronate for severe or symptomatic hypercalcae-
mia [II, A].
 Denosumab is recommended in patients with resistant
hypercalcaemia [III, A; FDA approved, not EMA approved].
 When a preoperative diagnosis of PC is made, upfront
surgery with en bloc removal of the parathyroid lesion
(avoiding capsule rupture and local seeding), homolateral
thyroid lobo-isthmectomy and central node dissection is
recommended [IV, A].
 In case of pathological diagnosis of PC after parathyroid-
ectomy,
reoperation
with
ipsilateral
thyroid
lobo-
isthectomy and
central node
dissection
should
be
discussed within 1 month of initial surgery [IV, A].

 RT may be discussed in an MTB, particularly for patients
with R1 or R2 resection and/or Nþ and/or persistent
hypercalcaemia [V, C].
Management of advanced and metastatic disease
PC is often locally advanced and distant metastases can
occur in the lung (40%), bone (30%) and liver (10%). Brown
tumours (osteolytic lesions of the bone caused by hyper-
parathyroidism) should be differentiated from bone me-
tastases, but this may be difﬁcult as they can show FDG
uptake; MRI can be useful to better characterise bone le-
sions.91 In case of known distant metastases, the probability
of achieving a complete response is low and frequently only
locoregional treatments can control the disease.92 Cina-
calcet should be continued in case of persistent severe
hypercalcaemia.
Data on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in PC are
scarce with only 79 patients reported in the literature be-
tween 1898 and 2018.93 A recent pooled analysis of all
metastatic PC cases reported that the most frequent
treatments were dacarbazine or anthracycline-containing
ChT and antiangiogenic drugs.93 The most frequent ChT
protocols included dacarbazine monotherapy, dacarbazinee
5-FU, cyclophosphamide monotherapy or methotrexatee
doxorubicinecyclophosphamideelomustine, but response
rates were low.93 Most cases in which antiangiogenics were
used involved sorafenib.94,95 PC is usually radioresistant;
despite limited data showing that RT can be applied as
adjuvant therapy to reduce local recurrence, its role is
mainly palliative.85
Recommendations
 The efﬁcacy of systemic treatment in advanced and met-
astatic disease is limited; thus, whenever possible,
debulking surgery and/or locoregional treatments should
be discussed to control tumour burden and hormonal
secretion [V, A].
 First-line systemic treatment may involve antiangiogenic
drugs [V, B] or alkylating agent-based ChT (dacarbazine,
temozolomide or streptozocin combined with 5-FU or
capecitabine) [V, C].
 Inclusion in clinical trials should be prioritised whenever
possible [V, A].
Follow-up, long-term implications and survivorship
The reported risk of recurrence is w50% at 2-5 years (based
mainly
on
cases
in
which
non-radical
surgery
was
used).56,75-77,79 Laboratory follow-up includes lifelong mea-
surement of calcium and PTH every 3 months, although
longer intervals (up to 4-6 months) are an option.79 Pro-
gressive and repeated increases in PTH and calcium levels
are suggestive of PC recurrence and cross-sectional imaging
(neck US, CT and/or MRI) should be carried out to identify
the site of recurrence. There is no validated role for scin-
tigraphy with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI in the follow-up of PC.
Recurrences and distant metastases can be small or
below the resolution of imaging (<1 cm), and occasionally
PC can evolve towards aggressive and rapidly progressive
forms and lose the ability for signiﬁcant uptake of [99mTc]Tc-
sesta-MIBI. In these cases, FDGePET can complement
conventional imaging.
The identiﬁcation of a germline CDC73 mutation should
prompt periodic screening for tumours associated with HPT-
JT (ossifying ﬁbromas of the mandible or maxilla, benign
and malignant uterine involvement, renal cysts).58 Genetic
testing should be carried out in all family members of
affected individuals. In ﬁrst-degree relatives, measurement
of
serum
calcium
levels
and
US
monitoring
are
recommended.
Recommendations
 Lifelong laboratory follow-up, including measurement of
calcium and PTH, is recommended every 3-4 months
during the ﬁrst 2 years, every 6 months during the sub-
sequent 3 years and annually thereafter [V, C].
 In case of calcium and/or PTH elevation, neck US and CT
scan of the neck, chest and abdomen together with a
neck MRI are recommended [V, A]. FDGePET can be pro-
posed to complete work-up, especially in rapidly pro-
gressing cases [V, C].
INTRATHYROID THYMIC CARCINOMA
Incidence and epidemiology
Previously known as carcinoma showing thymus-like dif-
ferentiation (CASTLE), intrathyroid thymic carcinoma (ITC) is
rare and believed to arise from the thymic remnants or
branchial pouch96 and, more rarely, from major salivary
glands.97 ITC accounts for <0.15% of thyroid neoplasms.98
Females are affected slightly more frequently than males
and the median age at diagnosis is 50 years.99
Diagnosis, pathology and molecular biology
ITC presents as a slow-growing neck mass with hard con-
sistency and poor mobility, located at the lower poles of the
thyroid gland. It appears as a cold nodule on thyroid scin-
tigraphy and as a solid, heterogenous and hypoechoic mass
on US. Most patients have locally advanced disease with
invasion of surrounding structures, including the recurrent
laryngeal nerve, strap muscle, trachea, oesophagus, soft
tissues and skin. Cervical lymph nodes are frequently
involved but few patients have distant metastases.99 At
diagnosis, w20% of patients have dyspnoea, dysphagia,
right laryngeal nerve paralysis and pain. FNA does not
provide a deﬁnitive diagnosis; histological conﬁrmation is
warranted.
ITC exhibits histological and immunophenotypic re-
semblances to eutopic thymic carcinoma. The tumour cells
generally grow in a solid or nested pattern, identical to
squamous-cell carcinoma arising in the thymus. Positive IHC
results for cluster of differentiation (CD)5, CD117 and p63
suggest
a
diagnosis
of
ITC

1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Similar to thymomas and
thymic carcinoma, on comparative genomic hybridisation
ITC is characterised by chromosomal imbalances such as
gains on chromosomal arm 1q and losses on 6p, 6q and
16q.100 The most frequently altered gene is the telomerase
reverse transcriptase promoter mutation C228T, identiﬁed
in 22% of cases.101 EGFR mutations have been docu-
mented102 but their prevalence cannot be estimated due to
the limited number of cases analysed.
Recommendations
 ITC should be suspected in the presence of a cold nodule
in the lower lobes of the thyroid gland with a cytological
diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma [V, A].
 Positive IHC for CD5, CD117 and p63 may allow for a pre-
operative diagnosis [V, B].
 Histological features that allow for a post-operative diag-
nosis of ITC are lymphoid stroma, squamous-cell differen-
tiation, infrequent mitoses and rare necrosis, positive IHC
for CD5, CD117 and p63, negative IHC for thyroglobulin,
TTF-1 and calcitonin, and Ki-67 <20% [IV, A].
Staging and risk assessment
Disease stage is the main prognostic factor. Application of
the eighth edition of the UICC staging classiﬁcation25 for
thyroid tumours is recommended, even if not speciﬁc for
ITC (see Supplementary Table S12, available at https://doi.
org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Neck US, CT of the
neck, thorax and abdomen, and neck MRI can be used for
staging. On CT, ITC appears as a well-deﬁned soft tissue
density without calciﬁcation, whereas on MRI, it appears as
an isointense and hyperintense mass on T1/T2-weighted
images.103 Similar to thymoma, ITC can show intense up-
take on FDGePETeCT; however, data on the use of FDGe
PETeCT in patients with ITC are very limited.104
Recommendations
 Accurate assessment of local extension with US or MRI is
crucial for planning appropriate surgical intervention
[IV, A].
 CT of the chest and abdomen should be carried out to
rule out the rare possibility of distant synchronous metas-
tasis [V, A]. Complementary FDGePETeCT may be useful
in some cases [V, C].
Management of local and locoregional disease
Surgery is the treatment of choice (Figure 7). A pooled
analysis of published cases99 showed that thyroidectomy
(total, subtotal or near total) was the most frequent surgical
procedure. Due to frequent nodal involvement at diagnosis,
neck lymph node dissection [i.e. modiﬁed radical neck
dissection (levels I-V), selective neck dissection of central
compartment (level VI) or lateral selective neck dissection
(levels II-IV)] was carried out in >55% of cases. Among
patients with a small ITC, 40% underwent thyroid lobec-
tomy without lymph node dissection. RT was used in only
two cases of locally advanced ITC not amenable to surgery
with radical intent.
The prognosis for patients with local or locoregional
disease is very good. In the pooled analysis,99 estimated
median disease-free survival was 144 months (range 91-197
months), median OS was not reached and w85% of

patients were alive after 5 years. Based on these data,
surgery is recommended as the ﬁrst-line therapeutic option
in patients with ITC with locoregional disease. The type of
surgery (i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be plan-
ned according to the available guideline for thyroid can-
cers,28 using conservative surgical treatment whenever
possible. Adjuvant RT does not improve prognosis and can
be avoided in most patients, although it may be discussed
for more advanced or aggressive cases. There is no role for
adjuvant ChT. Patients with locoregional disease not
amenable to surgery with radical intent could be offered RT
or chemoradiotherapy (CRT).
Recommendations
 Surgery is the mainstay of therapy. The type of surgery
(i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be planned ac-
cording to the available guidelines for thyroid cancers
[IV, A].
 Due to the indolent course of the disease and its good
prognosis, conservative surgical treatment is preferred
whenever possible [V, B].
 Neck dissection should be carried out according to guide-
lines for thyroid cancers [V, A].
 RT or CRT are reasonable options in case of locally
advanced disease not suitable for radical surgery [V, B].
 If possible, adjuvant RT should be avoided due to the
indolent disease course of ITC [IV, D]. It is an option in
selected cases after careful multidisciplinary discussion
[IV, B].
Management of advanced and metastatic disease
Among 120 patients with ITC who underwent primary
tumour resection, 29 (24%) experienced recurrence at a
median of 19 months (range 13-25 months).99 The recur-
rence was locoregional in 21 patients (72%), and was
treated surgically in 90% and using RT in 42% of cases, with
excellent prognosis. A minority (w10%) of patients devel-
oped distant metastases; ﬁve patients (4%) had metastases
at diagnosis and eight (6%) developed metachronous
distant metastases. The most common metastatic site was
the lung. Data on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in
patients with metastatic ITC are limited. Similar to the
recommendations for locally advanced or metastatic thy-
moma or thymic carcinoma,28 cisplatin-containing regimens
have been used in most ITC cases, with a reported objective
remission rate of 58%.99 Immunotherapy with the immune
checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab was used in one case,
resulting in long-lasting disease control. Based on this single
experience, it is not possible to recommend immuno-
therapy for the treatment of metastatic ITC.
Recommendations
 In case of local recurrence, salvage surgery is recommen-
ded [IV, A] and adjuvant RT may be discussed by an MTB
for patients who have not received prior RT [V, B].
 In case of metastatic disease, cisplatin-based combination
ChT regimens with either doxorubicin and cyclophospha-
mide or etoposide are the recommended options [V, B].
Follow-up, long-term implications and survivorship
Follow-up is aimed at identifying locoregional recurrences
and, more rarely, distant recurrences, usually within the ﬁrst
5 years after initial treatment.
Recommendations
 In localised disease, neck US and CT scan of the neck and
thorax are recommended 6-12 months after initial treat-
ment and then annually up to 5 years [V, C].
 In metastatic disease, follow-up by CT and/or MRI (in case
of liver, bone or brain metastases) every 3-6 months is rec-
ommended, depending on the tumour growth rate [V, A].
