Summary
Background There are currently no standard first-line treatment options for patients with higher grade 2–3, well-
differentiated, advanced, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of first-line [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate) treatment.
Methods NETTER-2 was an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, superiority, phase 3 trial. We enrolled patients 
(aged ≥15 years) with newly diagnosed higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 >20% and ≤55%), 
somatostatin receptor-positive (in all target lesions), advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours from 
45 centres across nine countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. We used interactive response technologies to 
randomly assign (2:1) patients to receive four cycles (cycle interval was 8 weeks ± 1 week) of intravenous ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate 
plus intramuscular octreotide 30 mg long-acting repeatable (LAR) then octreotide 30 mg LAR every 4 weeks 
(¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group) or high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR every 4 weeks (control group), stratified by neuroendocrine 
tumour grade (2 vs 3) and origin (pancreas vs other). Tumour assessments were done at baseline, week 16, and 
week 24, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free 
survival by blinded, independent, central radiology assessment. We did the primary analysis at 101 progression-free 
survival events as the final progression-free survival analysis. NETTER-2 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT03972488, and is active and not recruiting.
Findings Between Jan 22, 2020, and Oct 13, 2022, we screened 261 patients, 35 (13%) of whom were excluded. We 
randomly assigned 226 (87%) patients (121 [54%] male and 105 [46%] female) to the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group (n=151 [67%]) 
and control group (n=75 [33%]). Median progression-free survival was 8·5 months (95% CI 7·7–13·8) in the control 
group and 22·8 months (19·4–not estimated) in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group (stratified hazard ratio 0·276 [0·182–0·418]; 
p<0·0001). During the treatment period, adverse events (of any grade) occurred in 136 (93%) of 147 treated patients in 
the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and 69 (95%) of 73 treated patients in the control group. There were no study drug-related 
deaths during the treatment period.
Interpretation First-line ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide LAR significantly extended median progression-free survival 
(by 14 months) in patients with grade 2 or 3 advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate 
should be considered a new standard of care in first-line therapy in this population.

Introduction
Radioligand therapy delivers cytotoxic radiation directly 
to the tumour and, unlike most other systemic therapies, 
adverse events are generally minimal.1 [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-DOTA-
TATE (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate) is a ¹⁷⁷Lu-labelled somatostatin 
analogue that binds to somatostatin receptors,2 which are 
highly expressed in neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) and 
have been used diagnostically and therapeutically for 
decades.3 The groundbreaking phase 3 NETTER-1 trial 
established the efficacy and safety of ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus 
octreotide 30 mg long-acting repeatable (LAR) for the 
treatment of patients with advanced somatostatin 
receptor-positive grade 1 or grade 2 midgut NETs who 
had progressed on somatostatin analogues.4,5

analogues for almost all patients with low-grade and 
intermediate-grade (grade 1–2) gastroenteropancreatic 
NETs.6-8 Two phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled 
trials (CLARINET9 and PROMID10) have established 
somatostatin analogues as standard of care in grade 1–2 
NETs. The CLARINET study included patients with 
lower grade 2 NETs (Ki67 <10%), and excluded higher 
grade 2 NETs (Ki67 ≥10%).9 Historically, high-grade 
neuroendocrine neoplasms were universally described as 
poorly differentiated and often thought to be similar to 
small-cell malignancies. In 2017, grade 3 well-differen­
tiated NETs were formally recognised by WHO as a 
distinct entity from the poorly differentiated neuro­
endocrine carcinomas. There is a paucity of high-quality 
evidence with respect to gastroenteropancreatic-NET 
treatments, especially for higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and 
≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 >20% and ≤55%) in the first-
line setting.11 In patients with Ki67 greater than 55%, the 
role of platinum-based therapy is generally accepted,12,13 
but no randomised phase 3 studies have yet investigated 
the most appropriate treatment strategy for these 
patients.6,12 The lack of a defined first-line therapy 
represents an unmet need for these patients with 
metastatic disease. Retrospective analyses of treatment 
outcomes for patients with grade 3 well-differentiated 
gastroenteropancreatic NETs have reported on various 
therapeutic 
strategies, 
including 
chemotherapy, 
high-dose somatostatin analogues, targeted therapy, 
radio­ligand therapy, and local therapies, highlighting the 
need for robust, prospective, randomised data to inform 
optimal treatment selection.14,15
We present the primary results of the ongoing phase 3 
NETTER-2 trial, which aimed to investigate whether 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg LAR, at the same 
dose and schedule as established in the NETTER-1 trial,4 
would prolong progression-free survival compared with 
high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR, in patients with newly 
diagnosed, advanced higher grade 2–3, well-differentiated 
gastroenteropancreatic NETs.
Methods
Study design and participants
NETTER-2 was an international, multicentre, randomised, 
parallel-group, superiority, open-label study done at 
45 centres in nine countries across North America, 
Europe, and Asia. Eligible patients were aged 15 years or 
older with metastasised or locally advanced, histologically 
proven, higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 
(Ki67 >20% and ≤55%), well-differentiated gastro­
enteropancreatic NETs that were considered inoperable 
and had been diagnosed within 6 months before 
screening. Histological confirmation and Ki67 assessment 
were done locally by each study site. Cytology was not an 
acceptable 
method 
of 
gastroenteropancreatic-NET 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In 2017, grade 3 well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours 
were formally classified as a separate entity from the poorly 
differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas by WHO. Following 
the phase 3 PROMID and CLARINET studies, somatostatin 
analogues are the recognised first-line treatment for advanced 
grade 1–2 (Ki67 <10%) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumours and the role of platinum-based chemotherapy is 
generally accepted for neuroendocrine carcinomas, but there 
are limited robust data to support first-line treatment options 
for patients with advanced higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and 
≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 >20% and ≤55%) well-differentiated 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. To our 
knowledge, at the time of the NETTER-2 study design, no 
randomised phase 3 studies had been done in this population 
of patients with newly diagnosed, advanced or metastatic 
disease. This represents an unmet need and has been identified 
as an evidence gap in treatment guidelines. The pivotal, 
phase 3, NETTER-1 study showed that treatment with the 
radioligand therapy [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate) plus 
best supportive care (octreotide 30 mg long-acting repeatable 
[LAR]) provided a significant increase in progression-free 
survival to patients with progressive midgut grade 1–2 
neuroendocrine tumours compared with patients treated with 
high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR and led to regulatory 
approvals for ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate.
Added value of this study
NETTER-2 is the first randomised trial in any metastatic solid 
tumour to investigate a radioligand therapy in a first-line 
metastatic setting. Among patients with higher grade 2 
(Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 >20% and ≤55%) 
well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine 
tumours, ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg LAR showed 
a significant progression-free survival benefit versus high-dose 
octreotide 60 mg LAR (median progression-free survival 
22·8 months vs 8·5 months), with a high and durable response 
(overall response rate 43%; median duration of response 
23·3 months) without deterioration in quality of life. Our results 
will help to fill the evidence gap for high-grade 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours that has been 
highlighted in treatment guidelines and aid treatment decision 
making for these patients who currently have a worse 
prognosis compared with patients with lower-grade disease.
Implications of all the available evidence
NETTER-2 provides the first robust, randomised, phase 3 data 
for patients with newly diagnosed high-grade 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. These results 
have clinical practice-changing implications and support the 
use of ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate earlier within the disease course of higher 
grade 2–3 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.

diagnosis in this study. Patients were required to have a 
Karnofsky Performance Scale score of at least 60, 
bodyweight greater than 40 kg at screening, and 
somatostatin receptor expression on all target lesions, 
assessed by any somatostatin receptor imaging modality, 
within 3 months before randomisation. Somatostatin 
receptor uptake was scored according to a visual semi-
quantitative scale.16 Eligible patients were required to have 
an uptake score of 3 (greater than liver but lower than 
spleen) or 4 (greater than spleen). We excluded patients 
with creatinine clearance below 40 mL/min. Patients were 
also ineligible if they had received any previous peptide 
receptor radionuclide therapy, hepatic artery embolisation, 
or radiofrequency ablation for gastroenteropancreatic 
NETs. Previous systemic therapy for gastroenteropancreatic 
NETs was not allowed unless it was administered for less 
than 1 month and not within 12 weeks before 
randomisation. Patients who had received short-term 
(<6 months) somatostatin analogues with no evidence of 
progression were eligible for enrolment. Full eligibility 
criteria are listed in the protocol (appendix 2). Patients 
self-reported sex data (female or male). All patients 
provided written informed consent.
The trial protocol was approved by the institutional 
review board or independent ethics committee at each 
participating centre. The trial was done in accordance 
with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the 
International Conference on Harmonisation Good 
Clinical Practice guidelines, and all applicable regulations. 
The protocol, with amendments, is available in 
appendix 2. No changes occurred to the methods after the 
study commencement. NETTER-2 is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03972488.
Randomisation and masking

group stratified by tumour grade (2 vs 3) and tumour 
origin (pancreas vs other). We chose a 2:1 randomisation 
design to increase patients’ chances of receiving 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate. To minimise a potentially high dropout 
rate in the control group, patients were offered to cross 
over to ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate after centrally confirmed 
radiological 
progression. 
The 
randomisation 
list 
contained 240 pre-allocated records for each of the 
four strata in the study (960 records in total). The first 
patient in a specific stratum was assigned the first 
randomisation entry from the randomisation schedule 
pre-allocated to that stratum. Subsequent patients in the 
same stratum were assigned to the next available 
randomisation entry from the randomisation schedule 
pre-allocated to that stratum. We used a block size of six 
within each stratum. Forced randomisation was not 
allowed in this study. Tumour grade and origin are both 
important prognostic factors for gastro­entero­pancreatic 
NETs and thus were used as stratification factors.17,18 The 
trial was open label, so masking of treatments was not 
applicable.
Procedures
Patients were randomly assigned to receive ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate 
plus octreotide 30 mg LAR or high-dose octreotide 60 mg 
LAR (control group; appendix 1 p 3). In the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate 
group, four cycles of ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate (7·4 GBq [200 mCi]) 
were administered intravenously over 30 min every 
8 weeks (cumulative dose 29·6 GBq [800 mCi]). For renal 
protection, an intravenous infusion of 2·5% lysine-
arginine amino acid solution was started 30 min before 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate infusion and continued for 4 h.19 
Octreotide 30 mg LAR was administered intramuscularly 
after each ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate infusion every 8 weeks until 
completion of four ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate cycles, and then every 
4 weeks. In the control group, octreotide 60 mg LAR was 
administered intramuscularly every 4 weeks. We assessed 
tumours in both groups at baseline, week 16, and 
week 24, and then every 12 weeks until centrally 
confirmed disease progression or death. Somatostatin 
receptor imaging was not required for follow-up imaging. 
European Organisa­tion for the Research and Treatment 
of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires (EORTC 
QLQ-C30) were completed by patients every 12 weeks 
from initiation of treatment until end of treatment. We 
assessed safety throughout the trial, including adverse 
events and laboratory toxicities (graded according to the 
National Cancer Insti­tute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version 5.0). Randomised 
treatment was allowed to continue until centrally 
confirmed 
disease 
progression 
or 
treatment 
discontinuation for another reason. Patients with disease 
progression were able to enrol for post-progression 
crossover (control group) or re-treatment (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate 
group) upon meeting protocol criteria.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, 
defined as time from randomisation to first-line 
progression (as assessed by independent blinded central 
review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumours [RECIST] version 1.120) or death from any 
cause. Key secondary endpoints were objective response 
rate, defined as the rate of best overall response of 
complete or partial response (as assessed by independent 
central review according to RECIST 1.1), and time to

deterioration by 10 points from baseline in quality-of-life 
(QoL) scores for global health status, diarrhoea, fatigue, 
and pain as measured by EORTC QLQ-C30. Other 
secondary endpoints were disease control rate, duration 
of response, safety, and overall survival. The assessment 
timing of patient outcomes corresponds to the schedule 
described in the protocol (appendix 2). The NETTER-2 
study is ongoing for long-term patient follow-up and 
overall survival analysis.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis plan is available in appendix 3. We 
did the primary analysis at 101 progression-free survival 
events as the final progression-free survival analysis. We 
estimated that 99 progression-free survival events would 
be required to achieve 90% power using a one-sided log-
rank test at the overall 2·5% level of significance, to detect 
a 50% reduction in hazard rate, corresponding to a 
doubling of median progression-free survival from an 
assumed 15 months for the control group to 30 months 
for the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group. These assumptions were 
based on the results from NETTER-1 (progression-free 
survival was 28·4 months with ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate).19 We 
conservatively selected a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·5 and, 
therefore, a progression-free survival of 15 months for 
control was used for the sample size calculations. 
Assuming 
that 
enrolment 
would 
continue 
for 
approximately 22·2 months at a rate of ten patients per 
month and a 15% dropout rate by the time of primary 
progression-free survival analysis, we estimated that 
approximately 222 patients would need to be randomly 
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate versus control 
groups.
To control for the overall type I error, we tested the 
primary and key secondary endpoints hierarchically at 
the time of the primary analysis. The order of the 
hypothesis testing was progression-free survival followed 
by objective response rate, time to deterioration in QoL 
by EORTC QLQ-C30 for global health scale, time to 
deterioration for diarrhoea, time to deterioration for 
fatigue, and time to deterioration for pain. An endpoint 
would be tested only if all endpoints tested before it 
showed statistical significance.
We used the full analysis set for efficacy analyses and 
summary for demographic and baseline characteristics, 
which comprised all randomly assigned patients, and 
patients were analysed according to the randomised 
treatment. All safety analyses were based on the safety 
set, which included all patients who received at least 
one administration of study treatment. We compared 
progression-free survival using a log-rank test stratified 
by randomisation stratification factors (tumour grade 
and origin). We calculated the rank statistic and its 
variance separately for each stratum, then calculated the 
final statistic as the sum of rank statistics from all four 
strata divided by the square root of the sum of variances 
from all four strata, and compared the result with the 
normal distribution to obtain the p value. We estimated 
the survival distribution of progression-free survival 
using the Kaplan–Meier method. We estimated HRs 
with 95% CIs using a stratified Cox model. We compared 
objective response rate between treatment groups, and 
the corresponding odds ratio along with 95% CIs was 
calculated 
using 
the 
stratified 
Cochran–Mantel–
Haenszel method. We analysed time to deterioration in 
QoL using the same method as progression-free 
survival. Unless specified otherwise, we summarised 
categorical data as n (%) and continuous data as 
median (IQR).
All safety analyses were done in the safety set, 
which included all patients who received at least 
one administration of study treatment, and patients were 
analysed according to the study treatment received. We 
summarised adverse events by number and percentage 
of patients having at least one adverse event by preferred 
term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (version 26.0) and CTCAE (version 5.0). In the 
AE summary tables, patients with multiple CTCAE 
grades for the same preferred term were summarised 
under the maximum CTCAE grade recorded for the 
event.
Role of the funding source
The trial was designed and sponsored by Advanced 
Accelerator Applications, a Novartis Company. Data were 
analysed by the sponsor’s statistical team and provided to 
all authors for interpretation.

had grade 2 NETs and 79 (35%) had grade 3 NETs. 
Two (1%) patients had locally advanced unresectable 
disease; the remaining 224 (99%) patients had distant 
metastatic disease. Most patients had liver metastases 
(203 patients [90%]), followed by lymph node metastases 
in 135 patients (60%), bone metastases in 55 patients (24%), 
and peritoneal metastases in 35 patients (15%).
Tumour somatostatin receptor uptake score was 
3 in 81 (36%) patients and 4 in 145 (64%) patients, as per 
local assessment (table 1). The median time since initial 
diagnosis was 1·9 months (IQR 1·3–3·7).
In total, 129 (88%) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group 
received all four cycles of ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate (table 2). The 
median dose per cycle was 7·3 GBq (IQR 7·2–7·5; 
198 mCi), with a median cumulative dose of 29·2 GBq 
(28·0–29·8; 789 mCi; table 2). Patients in the 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group remained on study treatment 
(¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg LAR) for a 
median of 71·1 weeks (47·9–100·0) compared with 
40·3 (21·0–64·1) weeks for the control group (table 2). At 
the cutoff date of the primary analysis (July 20, 2023), 
78 (52%) patients remained on study treatment in the 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and 15 (20%) remained on 
octreotide 60 mg LAR in the control group. The median 
duration of patient follow-up from randomisation to data 
cutoff was 23·2 months (16·4–28·8).
The study met its primary objective of progression-free 
survival. At data cutoff, progression-free survival events 
had occurred in 55 (36%) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate 
group and 46 (61%) in the control group. The median 
progression-free survival, as per blinded central assess­
ment according to RECIST 1.1, was 22·8 months (95% CI 
19·4–not estimated [NE]) in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group 
versus 8·5 months (7·7–13·8) in the control group. We 
found a reduction in the risk of disease progression or 
death by around 72% in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group 
compared with the control group (HR for progression-
free survival with ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate vs control 0·276 
[0·182–0·418]; p<0·0001; figure 2A). The progression-
free survival benefit observed in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group 
was consistent across all prespecified subgroups 
(figure 2B). Progression-free survival results based on 
local tumour response assessment by investigators were 
in agreement with the centrally reviewed data (median 
progression-free survival 22·6 months [17·7–NE] in the 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and 8·2 months [5·6–11·1] in the 
control group).
The objective response rate was significantly higher in 
the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group (43·0% [95% CI 35·0–51·3]) 
than in the control group (9·3% [3·8–18·3])—ie, an 
improvement of 33·7% (23·4–44·0) and a stratified odds 
ratio 
of 
7·81 
(3·32–18·40; 
p<0·0001; 
table 
3). 
Eight (5%) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group had a 
complete response versus none in the control group 
(table 3). The median duration of response was 
23·3 months (18·4–NE) based on 65 responders in the 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and was NE (2·3–NE) with seven 
responders in the control group. The disease control rate 
as assessed by central review was higher in the 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group (90·7% [84·9–94·8]) compared with 
the control group (66·7% [54·8–77·1]).
Overall survival data were immature at the time of 
primary progression-free survival analysis. Median 
overall survival was not reached for either treatment 
group, and we found no difference in overall survival 
between treatment groups at the time of follow-up. By the 
cutoff date, 36 (48%) patients in the control group had 
progressed and crossed over to ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate treatment 
(n=29 during the crossover phase) or received 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate or ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatoc (n=7 during the follow-up 
phase), which might have confounded the overall survival 
results in addition to the data immaturity. Overall survival 
monitoring is ongoing in the long-term follow-up and 
will be analysed at the final analysis.
We found no significant difference between treatment 
groups for the key secondary endpoint of time to 
deterioration in QoL, as per EORTC QLQ-C30 scores 
(appendix 1 p 4).
Overall, 136 (93%) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group 
and 69 (95%) in the control group experienced an adverse 
event in the randomised treatment period (ie, up to the 
last randomised study treatment date plus 30 days), with 
the most common (≥20% in either group) being nausea 
(40 [27%] vs 13 [18%]), diarrhoea (38 [26%] vs 25 [34%]), 
and abdominal pain (26 [18%] vs 20 [27%]; table 4; 
appendix 1 p 5). Adverse events of grade 3 or worse were 
observed in 52 (35%) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group 
and 20 (27%) in the control group, with the most 
common (>3% in either group) being lymphocyte count 
decreased (eight [5%] vs 0), gamma-glutamyltransferase 
increased (seven [5%] vs two [3%]), small intestinal 
obstruction (5 [3%] vs 0), and abdominal pain

the time of data cutoff (at approximately 14 months from 
the first dose).
Six deaths occurred during the randomised treatment 
period (two in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and four in the 
control group), all attributed to disease progression under 
study. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were 
low for ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate (three [2%]) and for octreotide LAR 
(five [3%] in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and two [3%] for 
octreotide LAR in the control group; table 4). Few patients 
required dose reduction (three [2%] vs one [1%]) and the 
frequency of dose interruptions was similar in both groups 
(23 [16%] vs 11 [15%]).
Discussion
NETTER-2 is the first phase 3 study to report results for 
radioligand therapy administered first line to patients in 
any cancer population. It is also the first randomised 
study of any therapy for patients with grade 3 well-
differentiated gastroenteropancreatic NETs. In this 
study, patients with newly diagnosed higher grade 2–3, 
somatostatin receptor-positive, metastatic, gastroentero­
pancreatic NETs were shown to significantly benefit 
from radioligand therapy. The study met its primary 
objective, with ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg LAR 
reducing the risk of disease progression or death by 
around 72% compared with high-dose octreotide 60 mg 
LAR. Consistent benefit was observed across all 
subgroups, including grade 2–3 NETs, and pancreatic as 
well as non-pancreatic primary origin. In this patient 
population with grade 2–3 NETs, the objective response 
rate was 43·0% (one of the highest reported in the 
literature) with ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg 
LAR compared with 9·3% for octreotide 60 mg LAR. No 
new safety concerns were observed. Myelodysplastic 
syndrome is a recognised risk of radioligand therapy 
with ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate.19,21 In this study, one case of 
myelodysplastic 
syndrome 
was 
observed 
in 
the 
¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group. However, the follow-up time was 
limited at the time of primary analysis; long-term safety 
follow-up 
and 
data 
collection 
on 
secondary 
haematological malignancies are ongoing.

Before this study, little evidence existed to support 
treatment decisions in this patient population, and 
outcomes were generally poor. Although somatostatin 
analogues have been used as first-line treatment for 
advanced grade 1–2 gastroenteropancreatic NETs 
(Ki67 <10%) following the phase 3 PROMID10 and 
CLARINET studies,9,22 such robust data do not exist for 
higher grade 2 tumours (Ki67 ≥10%) or grade 3 well-
differentiated NETs.23 Small retrospective studies14,15,24,25 
have 
reported 
median 
progression-free 
survival 
durations of 4–8 months in patients with grade 3 NETs 
treated with first-line somatostatin analogues. Other 
potential options for higher grade 2–3 NETs include 
alkylating 
chemo­therapy 
regimens, 
such 
as 
5-fluorouracil plus strepto­zotocin and capecitabine plus 
temozolomide.8,15 Multicentre, retrospective analyses of 
temozolomide regimens for grade 3 NETs have shown 
response rates between 27·3% and 51·0%.26,27 All of 
these retrospective analyses were done after the design 
and initiation of NETTER-2, and complement the 
evidence presented here to aid in treatment decisions 
for patients with higher grade 2 or 3 gastro­
enteropancreatic NETs. Although there is no defined 
standard of care and robust data for this patient 
population, 
randomised 
data 
in 
patients 
with 
progressive pancreatic lower-grade NETs (Ki67 cutoff 
≤20%) showed a response rate of 40% with capecitabine 
plus temozolomide (phase 2 ECOG-ACRIN E2211 
study).28 The 60 mg dose of octreotide in the control 
group was selected following the NETTER-1 study 
design, which was developed following guidance from 
the US Food and Drug Administration. The high dose 
of octreotide did not have notable side-effects, 
suggesting that this regimen is well tolerated.4 
According to guidelines,6 somatostatin analogues may 
be used in high-grade gastro­enteropancreatic NETs, 
according to individual patient characteristics. Consider­
ing that all recruited patients in NETTER-2 had a high 
level of somatostatin receptor expression, this choice is 
rational.
In our study, time to deterioration in QoL was not 
significantly different between the treatment groups. 
This finding is perhaps not surprising given that patients 
in both groups received a backbone of somatostatin 
analogue therapy. Lack of QoL detriment with treatment 
by a radioligand therapy compared with a generally well-
tolerated somatostatin analogue is encouraging.
Until 
NETTER-2, 
no 
randomised 
studies 
had 
investigated first-line radioligand therapy for any solid 
tumour. The data from NETTER-2 add to evidence that 
early molecular imaging could help optimise treatment 
selection and sequencing for patients with somato­statin 
receptor-positive primary tumours of gastroentero­
pancreatic origin.
Our study has some limitations. Because of differences 
in administration methods between treatments, and the 
need for radiation-exposure precautions, this study was 
designed to be open label. Bias was mitigated through 
the blinded central review of imaging data. Although this 
study was open to patients aged 15 years or older, no 
accrual of adolescent patients aged 15–17 years occurred; 
therefore, these data relate to adults only. Relative 
effectiveness to other available therapies, sequencing, 
cost-effectiveness, and access issues should all be 
considered in future research.
Radioligand therapy is a promising new frontier in the 
treatment of cancers, which has previously been limited 
to surgery and systemic therapy. Our results will help to 
fill the evidence gap for high-grade gastroenteropancreatic 
NETs that has been highlighted in treatment guidelines.6,12 
The significant improvement in progression-free survival 
and response with ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide LAR 
compared with somatostatin analogues alone was 
observed across tumour site and grade and will have 
clinical practice-changing implications in support of 
first-line radioligand therapy as standard of care for 
advanced higher grade 2 and grade 3, well-differentiated, 
gastroenteropancreatic NETs.
