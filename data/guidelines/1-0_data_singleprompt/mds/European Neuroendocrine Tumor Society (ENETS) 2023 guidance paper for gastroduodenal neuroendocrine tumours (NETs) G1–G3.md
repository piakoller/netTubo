Abstract
The aim of the present guidance paper was to update the previous ENETS
guidelines on well-differentiated gastric and duodenal neuroendocrine tumours
(NETs), providing practical guidance for specialists in the diagnosis and manage-
ment of gastroduodenal NETs. Type II gastric NETs, neuroendocrine carcinomas
(NECs), and functioning duodenal NETs are not covered, since they will be dis-
cussed in other ENETS guidance papers.

Introduction – general background
Gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms (gNENs) are rare tumours with an
increasing annual incidence of 0.4/100,000, and a prevalence of
3/100,000.1 The vast majority of gNENs are well-differentiated neu-
roendrocrine tumours (NETs), which are usually classified according to
the background gastric pathology into three major categories:
(i) type I when chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is present resulting in
hypergastrinaemia (the most common type, accounting for 75%–
80% of all gNENs); (ii) type II when the tumour occurs due to hyper-
gastrinaemia in the context of Zollinger–Ellison syndrome (ZES) and

multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I) syndrome (5% of
gNENs); type III, which are sporadic lesions not associated with
hypergastrinaemia (15%–25% of gNENs). Type I gNETs are indolent,
with negligible risk of metastases (<5%) and excellent long-term sur-
vival (almost 100%); the prognosis of a patient with type II gNETs
needs to be assessed in the context of MEN-I syndrome; however,
the risk of metastases may vary between 10% and 30%. Type III
tumours are usually more aggressive, owing to the high prevalence
of metastatic disease (>50%) and the more unfavourable long-term
survival (5-year survival rate 70%), although they present well-
differentiated morphology in the majority of cases. Type III gNENs
may also have higher grades. The key questions discussed in the pre-
sent paper are summarised in Table 1. Data were identified by MED-
LINE database searches and expert opinion/recommendations given
according to the best available evidence and the authors’ experi-
ence. Each recommendation for treatment and diagnosis will have a
level of evidence and grade of recommendation as per the GRADE
system (Table S1). The major features of gNETs are summarised in
Table 2.

Assessment of gastric neuroendocrine
tumours
1.2.1

Pathology
Gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs) are different from other
gastrointestinal NETs as in the stomach a clear aetiology is emerging
where gastric NETs are induced in the context of hyperplasia of
enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. In 1993 an aetiological framework
for gastric NETs was reported,2 where gastric NETs were either
found in a setting of ECL cell hyperplasia associated with high gas-
trin levels due to autoimmune fundic atrophic gastritis (type I NETs),
high gastrin levels due to gastrinoma (type II NETs) or without ECL
hyperplasia (type III NETs). More recently, general atrophy in chronic
H. pylori associated gastritis,3 functional failure of parietal cells due
to mutations4 or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use5 have also been
reported to be associated with NETs, some with a background of
ECL cell hyperplasia but in cases of proton pump inhibition also
associated with parietal cell hyperplasia. These newly described gas-
tric NETs are similar to the originally described type I gNETs as they
are secondary to failed acid secretion. The secondary (type I and
type II) gNETs have a more indolent course2,5 and can be reversible
if the cause can be impeded. It is therefore important to recognise
the associated gastric mucosal changes.6
Adequate tumour sampling is essential for grading NETs as pre-
scribed in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of gas-
trointestinal tumours of 2019.7 As NETs are usually located deep in
the mucosa (not at the surface) attention should be paid to this when
taking biopsies.
Gastric NETs are graded using the same criteria as for all gastroin-
testinal sites:8
G1: mitotic count <2 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index <3% in hotspot
of at least 500 cells.
G2: mitotic count between 2 and 20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index
between 3% and 20% in hotspot of at least 500 cells.
G3: mitotic count >20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20% in hot-
spot of at least 500 cells.
1.2.2
|
Endoscopy
The primary diagnostic tool for gNETs is oesophagogastroduode-
noscopy (OGD). For the assessment of gastric NETs, not only rep-
resentative biopsies of the tumour but also biopsies of the
surrounding mucosa and other parts of the stomach (antrum and
body-fundus) are essential as these give clues on the nature/
aetiology and, with this, the prognosis and treatment of the NET.
In addition, sampling of gastric juice for pH measurement is
strongly encouraged. Furthermore, virtual chromoendoscopy (nar-
row-band imaging, blue light imaging, i-scan) may be useful to pro-
vide
additional
information
to
identify
field
changes
or
precancerous lesions in underlying atrophic mucosa.9 In addition
to OGD, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be performed in all
lesions >1 cm regardless of type and in all lesions of type III
regardless of size, unless large or metastatic lesions are found.
Reporting should include size of the lesion infiltration depth and
assessment of local lymph nodes.
Recommendations
Evaluation of gNETs should always include:
1. Biopsies to evaluate proliferative activity of the tumour (Ki67
and/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).

3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).
1.2.3

Imaging and laboratory examinations
Biomarker assessment should include fasting gastrin and chromo-
granin A (CgA). Whereas gastrin may be useful to differentiate
between different types (elevated in type I and type II, normal in
type III), CgA is only useful as a tumour marker in type III gNETs.
In the presence of ongoing PPI therapy gastrin and CgA are not
diagnostic and are difficult to interpret. In general, caution should
be used when evaluating CgA values, considering the different
diagnostic accuracy of available assays. Parietal cell and intrinsic
factor antibodies, vitamin B12 and thyroid function parameters
should be measured in suspected cases of autoimmune gastritis.
Whereas type I gNETs do not usually require additional cross-
sectional imaging, type III gNETs should undergo cross-sectional
imaging – liver contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and/or contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography
(CT), with previous ingestion of water immediately before examina-
tion, to fill stomach and duodenum and better depict small enhancing
lesion in the arterial phase, and functional imaging, preferentially
somatostatin receptor PET/CT (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT).
These should also be considered in cases of type I gNETs with
metastases on EUS or high-risk features of metastases (G2, lymphatic
or vascular invasion, size ≥1 cm). Recently, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT has
been suggested in selected cases with tumour diameter >1 cm, G2
tumours (perhaps Ki-67 > 10 but exact cutoff not determined), or R1
margins after endoscopic resection.10
Prognosis depends on type, size, grading, histological risk factors
(e.g., lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion), completeness of
resection and initial tumour stage.
Recommendations
1. Gastrin assessment is useful to differentiate between different
types of gNETs. CgA is useful as tumour marker only in type III
gNETs (3b-A).
2. Cross-sectional radiological imaging (CT/MRI) and 68Ga-SSA-PET-
CT are not required in type I gNETs, unless metastases on EUS or
in the presence of high-risk features (G2, vessel invasion, sus-
pected T2 on EUS ) (3b–A).

Management strategy for type I gNETs
1.3.1
|
Introduction
Treatment options for type I gNETs include surveillance, endoscopic
resection, somatostatin analogues (SSA) and eventually surgery. As
prognosis is usually quite favourable and tumour growth slow and risk
of metastases is below 1% in tumours <10 mm, all NET <1 cm can be
observed without any need for intervention.11,12 The ideal schedule
for observational OGD is not defined and clinical practice ranges from
every 6 months to every 2 years. Planning the first follow-up after
6 months and then every 12 months is the most widely used
approach. A regular rebiopsy of lesions is not necessary unless atypi-
cal features (e.g., ulceration, erosion, pitting) appear, suggesting inva-
sive progression of the lesion. The management of type I gNETs is
summarised in Figure 1.
1.3.2
|
Q1 – What is the role of endoscopic
resection for type I gNETs? Is additional treatment
required in cases of R1 endoscopic resection?
Endoscopic resection should be considered for type I gNETs larger
than 1 cm and for those lesions demonstrating increased Ki-67 as
these features are associated with an increased risk of metastases and
progression.11,13 Many small type I gNETs are G1 or low G2
(Ki-67 < 10%);14 however, a Ki-67 cutoff has not been defined to
determined when excision should be performed. Endoscopic ultraso-
nography to determine depth of local invasion and assessment of local
lymph nodes should be performed in lesions >1 cm and in smaller
tumours with “high” G2 grade (cutoff not established) before any
resection. No other imaging modality is required at this stage. The re-
section technique of choice depends on size and position of the
lesion, invasion depth and local experience. Endoscopic mucosal re-
section (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and full-
thickness resection (FTR) are all associated with a low risk profile for
both bleeding and perforation. It is not clear which is the best endo-
scopic technique to be used for achieving a complete R0 resection.15
However, resection by ESD or FTR achieve higher rates of R0 resec-
tion, but no randomised trials have compared all techniques head-to-
head.16,17 For R1 resection status a re-resection in a “step-up”
approach could be recommended (e.g., ESD after EMR, FTR after
ESD), although data showing risk of local recurrence after R1

resection are scarce,18 particularly for smaller tumours which may be
managed by a non-interventional endoscopic surveillance after initial
R1 resection.19
Conclusion/recommendations
1. Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger
than 1 cm (2b-A).
2. ESD and FTR are more effective to achieve R0 resection compared
to EMR (2b-B).
3. In case of incomplete resection (R1) of a NET >1 cm a step-up
approach (EMR > ESD > FTR > surgery) is recommended (4-C).

Q2 – When should somatostatin analogues
be used to treat type I gNETs?
Type I gNETs usually express somatostatin receptors. Thus, therapy
with SSA can be initiated in metastasised patients or patients not
amenable to endoscopic or surgical resection (e.g., difficult location,
old age, comorbidities). SSA therapy is associated with a high com-
plete response rate of 25%–100%, but relapse is frequently observed
after discontinuation of therapy.20 Thus, continuous therapy would be
the appropriate approach. Another reason for starting SSA therapy
could be large tumour size or the requirement of repeated endoscopic
resection for progressive lesions, although data evaluating this
approach are lacking. Another therapeutic approach could be direct
inhibition of gastrin signalling in tumour cells. Indeed, the gastrin
receptor
inhibitor
netazepide
has
been
evaluated
in
a
proof-
of-concept phase II trial with 16 patients showing a complete
response rate in 30% of patients.21 Like SSA treatment, tumour
relapse after discontinuation was observed in all patients. The clinical
benefit of netazepide needs to be evaluated in larger randomised clini-
cal trials before any recommendation for its use can be formulated.
Recommendations
1. In type I gNET patients when tumour resection is indicated but
endoscopic or surgical techniques are not possible, SSA therapy is
appropriate (2b-A).
1.3.4
|
Q3 – What is the recommended follow-up
schedule in type I gNETs?
An endoscopic follow-up every 12 months is recommended after
complete endoscopic resection of a type I gNET. Whether this interval
can be increased after prolonged periods without evidence of relapse
or whether the interval should be shortened in case of incomplete
(R1) resection or risk factors associated with progression (grading G2,
size >20 mm) should be carefully discussed with the patient. In gen-
eral, no cross-sectional imaging is required for follow-up. In addition,
repeated evaluation of biomarkers CgA and gastrin should not be per-
formed as these markers are elevated due to the underlying CAG and
are not an indicator of relapse or progression. Follow-up OGD is
recommended in a type I gNET that does not require resection,
although the optimal interval for planning endoscopy is not estab-
lished
(1–2 years
can
be
considered,
following
first
follow-up
6–12 months after initial diagnosis). Apart from risk of tumour pro-
gression or relapse after resection in NET lesions, patients with CAG

carry a relevant risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma. Although
only one international guideline recommends a regular endoscopic
follow-up for patients with CAG, the yearly rate of adenocarcinoma
detection is up to 1% in patients with type I gNETs.14 Whether this
reflects an increased risk of adenocarcinoma development in patients
with a previous diagnosis of gNET is not clear. For CAG patients with-
out a gNET, intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection have been
linked to an increased risk of adenocarcinoma progression. Given the
high risk of adenocarcinoma detection upon follow-up of gNETs, this
supports the recommendation to perform an endoscopic follow-up
every 12–24 months in patients with previously diagnosed gNETs
(specific timing may be proposed according to tumour size and histo-
logical features), whereas a 3-year interval is recommended in CAG
patients without gNETs.22
Recommendations
1. An endoscopic follow-up by OGD is recommended 12 months
after complete endoscopic resection of type I gNET (2b-B).
2. In
those
not
requiring
resection
first
follow-up
should
be
12 months and then consider annual to every 1–2 years (2b-B).
3. In patients with type I gNET, endoscopic follow-up by OGD is
recommended also given the risk of developing gastric adenocarci-
noma related to CAG (2b-A).
1.3.5
|
Q4 – When is surgery recommended for
type I gNETs?
Although type I gNETs are usually treated by an endoscopic approach,
upfront surgical resection is recommended in all tumours that are
greater than 20 mm in size or with suspected muscolaris propria inva-
sion (either on axial imaging or EUS). In addition, surgery could be
considered in tumours showing high risk features on biopsy (e.g., high
grade 2 NET [cutoff not established], lymphovascular invasion). A lim-
ited resection with sampling of local lymph nodes is the preferred
approach. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy should be
discussed in patients with known lymph node metastases or might be
proposed as a completion procedure after final histology has proven
lymphatic spread, although there are no solid data supporting this
option.
Endoscopic resection should not be attempted in the presence of
invasion into the muscularis propria, suspected lymph node metasta-
ses or high-risk features of metastatic spread (e.g., high Ki-67, vascular
invasion, size >20 mm). These patients should receive full staging
including cross-sectional imaging as described previously and 68Ga-
SSA-PET-CT and upfront surgical management. The optimal cutoff
value for Ki-67 is not determined, but Ki-67 values above 10% should
trigger evaluation of surgical treatment. In the rare instance of a G3
type I gNET a primarily surgical approach is recommended due to high
risk of metastases.23 Regarding tumour size, no clear cutoff for surgi-
cal management can be defined. Only limited data exist on tumour
size and risk of metastases in the subgroup of type I gNETs. Data from
the SEER database and from a large series from Taiwan showed that a
cutoff of 20 mm was associated with an increased risk of lymph node
metastases.13,24
In case of incomplete endoscopic resection (R1) or risk features in
final pathology after endoscopic resection, a surgical approach should
be discussed with the patient to achieve R0 resection and/or re-
section of local lymph nodes to exclude metastatic spread. In cases of
lesions not amenable to an endoscopic approach (e.g., location close
to cardia) a primary surgical resection might be necessary.
SSA treatment to reduce gastrin production, thus diminishing the
stimulus for further tumour growth and progression, could be pro-
posed in patients who could not undergo resection or for multiple
larger tumours or frequent relapse. Antrectomy should no longer be
routinely offered but might be an option in patients not tolerating
SSA or declining continuous application.
Recommendations
1. Surgical approach is recommended in tumours >20 mm or with
suspected muscolaris propria invasion (either on axial imaging or
EUS). In addition, surgery could be considered (in tumours show-
ing high risk features on biopsies (high Ki-67, lymphovascular inva-
sion) (2b-A).
2. Limited resection with local nodal sampling is the preferred surgical
strategy (3b-A).
3. Gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy (specific kind of re-
section according with the tumour site) should be discussed in
patients with known lymph node metastases or might be proposed
as a completion procedure after final histology has proven lym-
phatic spread after full exploration with cross sectional imaging
(3b-A).

Type II gNETs

Management strategy for type III gNETS
1.5.1

Background
Type III gNETs have been traditionally regarded as highly aggressive
tumours requiring extended surgical resections (i.e., partial or total
gastrectomy) with lymphadenectomy. However, with the widespread
use of high-definition endoscopy, type III gNETs of smaller size and
lower grade are increasingly being detected. A recent systematic
review of 147 type III gNENs in which tumour management was
reported found that 45% were G1, 35% were G2 and 20% were
G3.26 As a result, less invasive treatment options, ranging from endo-
scopic resection to surgical wedge resection, have been investigated

in highly selected patients. The management of type III gNETs is sum-
marised in Figure 2.
1.5.2
|
Q5 – Can endoscopic treatments be
proposed to treat type III gNETs?
Type III gNETs should be carefully characterised using endoscopy,
biopsy, cross sectional thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI, and often
functional imaging (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT or FDG/PET-CT depending on
tumour grade) and in most cases EUS. Evidence from several retro-
spective
case
series
suggests
that
carefully
selected
patients
who have no evidence of lymph node involvement can be safely and
successfully
managed
by
endoscopic
resection.
Endoscopic
re-
section appears to be most appropriate in patients who have localised
G1 tumours ≤10 mm in diameter, because tumours greater than this
size are more likely to have lymph node metastases (even though
these may not be detected by imaging techniques).26,27 However
endoscopic resection can also be considered in patients with slightly
larger tumours (<15 mm) and low G2 (Ki-67 3–10%) histology, partic-
ularly if the risks of surgical resection are considered to be high.26
Current evidence does not support the use of a particular endoscopic
resection technique (EMR vs. ESD).26 Some very small (<5 mm)
tumours have also been unintentionally removed by avulsion biopsy
with no evidence of subsequent tumour recurrence, but this approach
is
not
generally
recommended.26
Patients
with
positive
re-
section margins (R1) should be considered for additional endoscopic
resection or surgical salvage if appropriate. Patients who have under-
gone endoscopic resection should have close follow up with endos-
copy and imaging (thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI) to detect local
and distant tumour recurrence.
Recommendations
1. Endoscopic resection may be considered in patients who have
localised type III G1 gNETs ≤10 mm, and occasionally larger
tumours with Ki-67 <10% and <15 mm in diameter if the risks of
surgical
resection
are
high
provided
adequate
staging
is
allowed (3a–C).

Q6 – When should limited or extended
surgical treatments be proposed to treat type III
gNETs?
Several clinicopathological features should be carefully evaluated to
identify the best surgical option (limited vs. extended resection) for
patients with type III gNETs.
A limited gastric wedge resection without standard lymphade-
nectomy can be considered as treatment option in patients with loca-
lised, G1 type III gNETs with no evidence of lymph node involvement
on preoperative imaging (including EUS).26 In patients fulfilling the
above-mentioned criteria, tumour size, depth of infiltration and pres-
ence of lymphovascular invasion should be further assessed to define
the extent of surgical resection. Therefore, a wedge resection can be
safely proposed to patients with G1 type III gNETs <20 mm, limited to
the submucosal layer and with no evidence of lymphovascular inva-
sion.26,28 The role of wedge resections in patients with G2 type III gNETs
remains debated, as tumour grade represents a powerful predictor of dis-
ease aggressiveness. Similarly, the tumour size cutoff for proposing lim-
ited surgical resection is not clearly defined. Type III gNETs <10 mm are
usually managed with endoscopic resection, whereas a limited surgical re-
section might be considered as initial treatment option for lesions measur-
ing >10 mm and <20 mm.26 Recent experiences report favourable

oncological outcomes after endoscopic resection/limited surgical resec-
tion, thus strengthening the notion that a conservative approach might be
appropriate for highly selected patients with type III gNETs.27,29 In the
presence of positive margins (R1) after endoscopic resection, salvage sur-
gical wedge resection represents a possible treatment strategy.
Radical surgical resection, either total or subtotal gastrectomy, with
lymphadenectomy represents the procedure of choice for all the patients
diagnosed with type III gNETs showing at least one of the following fea-
tures: (1) nodal or distant metastases on preoperative imaging, (2) Ki-67
proliferative index defining a G3 tumour (Ki-67 >20%), and (3) tumour
size >20 mm. Radical surgery is recommended as second-line treatment
when final histology reveals one or more of the following findings: pres-
ence of nodal metastases, higher tumour grade compared with original
biopsy, lymphovascular invasion or lack of complete tumour clearance
(R1), in patients initially managed with a limited wedge resection.26
Recommendations
1. A limited wedge resection with local nodal sampling (without standard
lymphadenectomy) can be considered as a treatment option in patients
with localised, G1–G2 type III gNETs, with no evidence of lymphade-
nopathy on full staging preoperative imaging (including EUS) (2b-B).
2. Radical surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is recommended in
type III gNETs when nodal metastases are found/suspected on preop-
erative staging, if Ki67 >20% or tumour diameter >20 mm (2b-B).

Follow-up of patients who underwent surgical resection of type III
gNETs is based on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging (thora-
coabdominal CT/liver-MRI with sometimes OGD and/or EUS or func-
tional imaging [68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and/or FDG-PET/CT depending on
the tumour grade]). The timing of follow-up has never been clearly
defined. When a total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is per-
formed, the follow-up schedule adopted for gastric adenocarcinoma
should be applied.26 On the other hand, patients managed conserva-
tively (endoscopic or surgical local excision) should undergo OGD
after about 3 months to check the resection site and if this shows no
macroscopic residual tumour, they should have regular follow-up with
cross-sectional imaging and endoscopy/EUS. The frequency and
choice of test will be influenced by the final tumour size and grade as
well as patient fitness and in most cases, it will be possible to reduce
the frequency of follow up as time progresses after resection. 68Ga-
SSA-PET-CT (or FDG-PET/CT depending on the tumour grade) and
biopsies should be performed in the presence of a suspected disease
relapse, but they are not routinely part of the follow-up programme.30
Recommendations
1. Radiological follow-up by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recom-
mended in patients treated by surgical resection for type III gNETs (5-A).

DUODENAL NEUROENDOCRINE
TUMOURS
2.1

Introduction – general background
Like gNETs, duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs) are rare
tumours but also with an increasing incidence found mostly at OGD
or axial imaging for other reasons (incidental discovery) but also can
be found as primaries at workup for patients with stage 4 diseases or
more rarely as part of inherited syndromes such as MEN-I and neuro-
fibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Most dNETs are non-functional tumours,
but duodenal tumours secreting gastrin are not infrequent (either spo-
radic or as part of MEN-I) and more rarely tumours secreting somato-
statin (so called somatostatinomas) (see Guidance paper on functional
pancreatic NETs).
The overall incidence of dNETs is low accounting for only 2.8% of
all NETs.31,32 The annual age adjusted incidence for dNET has been
reported to be 0.19 per 100,000.32 Traditionally, dNETs have been
classified into non-functioning (approximately 90% of lesions) or func-
tioning tumours (those secreting specific peptides of hormones elicit-
ing a functional clinical consequence or syndrome)33 and can be
summarised as:
1. Non-functioning dNETs (they can secrete peptides and substances
not resulting in a clinical condition or syndrome).
2. Duodenal composite gangliocytoma/neuroma and neuroendocrine
tumour (CogNET) (previously known as gangliocytic paragan-
glioma), occurs almost exclusively in the second part of the duode-
num and periampullary region and is considered a composite
tumour of epithelial NETs and ganglioneuroma.34
3. Duodenal gastrinoma (gastrin secreting and either sporadic or part
of MEN-I where duodenal localisation is very frequent) and soma-
tostatinomas (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance
paper on functioning pancreatic NETs).
4. Duodenal NEC (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance
paper for digestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).

Assessment of dNETs
2.2.1
|
Pathology
Pathological assessment and grading of dNETs is like that of NETs of
all other sites. Adequate sampling is needed and the deep mucosal
location of these lesions, usually suspected by the endoscopist due to
the smooth surface as opposed to the more common adenomas and
carcinomas of the duodenum, warrants an attempt to perform deep
biopsies. Morphologically, the main differential diagnosis in the duo-
denum is the CoGNET, previously classified as a ganglioneuroma or
paraganglioma, but now shown to be more similar to NETs.36,37

2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20%), NEC and adenocarcinoma with

neuroendocrine features should be ruled out (see guidance paper for
digestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).
2.2.2
|
Endoscopy
Most dNETs are in the first or second part of the duodenum.38 Symp-
toms range from mostly none at incidental discovery to symptoms
attributed to gastric outlet obstruction (in rare cases of large lesions)
or anaemia. Patients with dNETs close to the ampulla and CoGNET
which occur in the periampullary region can present with gastrointes-
tinal bleeding, abdominal pain, anaemia or jaundice.38,39 Periampullary
dNETs are not infrequent in patients with neurofibromatosis type
1 (NF1), also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease including
somatostatinomas.40,41
At OGD, dNETs have similar features to gNETs but are typically
single small sessile, erythematous or pale lesions in the duodenal cap,
bulb or D1 to D2.6 In recent years, increasingly smaller lesions have
been detected, owing to the better mucosal visualisation with modern
endoscopic tools. The reported mean size of dNETs varies between
7 mm and 1.5 cm.42 Up to 10% of dNETs can occur as multiple
tumours, which should prompt a diagnosis of MEN-I. It has been
reported that approximately a quarter to a third of patients with
dNETs and ZES, have undiagnosed MEN-I.43,44
Endoscopic characterisation of dNETs has been described by Bor-
bath and colleagues.6 Diagnosis is usually confirmed at endoscopic
forceps biopsy (care as very small lesions may be almost completely
excised at biopsy sampling and making future identification hard in
case of R1 resection). Tumours of 1 cm or above should have accurate
local staging by EUS as regional lymph node metastases occur in up to
40%–60% of cases, especially in duodenal gastrinomas.43,45,46
Recommendations
Evaluation of dNETs should always include:
1. Biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate proliferative activ-
ity of the tumour (Ki-67 and/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).
2. Endoscopic assessment of dNETs should include tumour location
to identify periampullary tumours (2b-A).
3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).
2.2.3
|
Imaging and laboratory examinations
Duodenal NETs are generally diagnosed by endoscopy and endoscopic
ultrasound. Computed tomography after ingestion of water to fill stom-
ach and duodenum, is recommended to help preoperative exploration.
CT-enterography, MRI, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and 18F-DOPA-PET/CT are
not sufficiently accurate for localisation of well-differentiated gastrodu-
odenal primary tumours,47–49 but these examinations are used to help
staging of regional and distant metastases.50
Laboratory tests are required for patients newly diagnosed with
dNET. It is especially important to recognise potential gastrinoma
(serum gastrin, chromogranin and occasionally secretin testing). Other
laboratory tests, if symptoms are suggestive, may include somato-
statin, and very rarely growth hormone releasing factor and cortisol
with urinary 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid.38 If a diagnosis of genetic syn-
drome is suspected (e.g., MEN-I or NF1) specific laboratory tests and
germline testing is advised38,51 Distinguishing between dNET and
neurofibromas may be difficult in some cases especially on axial
imaging.
Recommendations
1. Locoregional and distant staging examiner actions for dNETs
include contrast-enhanced CT (with water ingestion), liver -MRI
and 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT (3b-B).
2. Ruling out gastrinoma and screening for genetic syndromes when
appropriate should be considered for dNETs (3b-B).
2.3
|
Management strategy for dNETs
Factors that need to be considered prior to endoscopic resection of
dNET are:
1. Size of tumour (commonly estimated at EUS and OGD).
2. Depth of invasion in relation to the deep muscle layer (estimated
at EUS).
3. Any evidence of lymphadenopathy and/or metastatic spread on
EUS, liver-MRI, thoracoabdominal CT and functional imaging, pref-
erably 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.
4. Grade and morphology of tumour (determined by endoscopy, EUS
and endoscopic biopsy).
5. Endoscopic
appearance:
central
depression/ulceration
implies
invasion.
6. Suitability for endoscopic resection: size of lesion/endoscopic
access/location of lesion/proximity to ampulla.
7. Hormone secretion status.
8. Patient age and performance status.
Size of the lesion is not a definitive guide to the correct treat-
ment. Treatment options are: endoscopic surveillance, endoscopic re-
section (by EMR/ESD/underwater EMR/over the scope clip), local
duodenal resection (LR) or pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). The out-
comes may be related to the factors of the tumour at presentation
rather than the type of resection procedure.52 The management of
dNETs is summarised in Figure 3.
When defining surgical indications for dNET, several key points
should be considered (see section 8.3).
2.3.1
|
Q8 – When is endoscopic
resection indicated?
Very small non-functioning lesions 5 mm or less in D1 are commonly
removed after lifting injection and snare (or by diagnostic biopsy)
before any histological diagnosis is made and these lesions do not
usually recur or metastasise.

---
For younger and fitter patients who have lesions of 5–10 mm
(and up to 15 mm in some centres), an opinion should be sought
from therapeutic endoscopy about resection and the associated
risks. EUS should be performed as well as axial and functional imag-
ing. Most of these lesions are grade 1 and not invading the muscle
layer.
In
these
circumstances
an
endoscopic
resection
using
EMR/Cap EMR/ESD is reasonable, but risks of perforation are signif-
icant, especially in D2. If endoscopic therapy is high risk (published
rates of perforation 15%–25%) or unlikely to be curative, LR
(i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision or enucleation) or pancrea-
toduodenectomy (PD) (if considered essential by the surgeon) should
be considered. Endoscopic therapy combined with laparoscopy for
rescue in the event of perforation has been performed which may
represent a novel and valuable alternative to ESD, able to guarantee
a
high
R0
rate
and
a
low
risk
of
intraoperative
duodenal
perforation.53
Duodenal NETs can be multiple, particularly if they are gas-
trinomas, and an association with MEN-I exists. Somatostatino-
mas
can
also
occur
in
the
duodenum,
often
close
to
the
ampulla, but generally are without a clinical syndrome. There is
an
association
with
NF1
(functioning
tumours
are
being
addressed in a separate guidance paper on pancreatic func-
tional NETs).
Recommendations
1. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 should be removed
using EMR type techniques (3b-C).
2. Lesions of 5–10 mm (and up to 15 mm in some centres) can be
removed endoscopically after imaging work-up, but risks are rela-
tively high (3b-C).
2.3.2
|
Q9 – Can a “watch and wait” strategy be
proposed in dNETs?
A watch and wait policy could be considered for very small (<5 mm)
dNETs that cannot easily be resected, are non-functional, G1 and not
invading the muscularis propria. This policy has usually been applied in
patients unfit for endoscopic resection or surgery, since a more defini-
tive therapy would be recommended in most cases, although a watch
and wait policy has more recently been recommended as a result from
some small series with limited follow-up. It is not clear if watch and
wait is a suitable option in a patient who is fit for resection.54,55
Recommendations
There is very limited evidence for a watch and wait policy and generally
this is applied to those unfit for surgery or endoscopic resection (3b-C).
2.3.3
|
Q10 – When is surgery indicated?
Data on nodal risk in very small non-functioning dNETs are scarce.
Some series report nodal metastases as a common finding in patients
with dNET (40%–60%), with tumour size being the most relevant risk

factor for nodal involvement.56 In cases with a tumour diameter >1 cm,
nodal metastases were found in 13 out of 18 cases. Tumour location
may be another important feature to be considered when defining sur-
gical indication. Lesions arising in the ampullary/periampullary area dif-
fer from other dNETs due to a more aggressive biological behaviour in
some studies57 but not in others.56 Functioning neoplasms harbour a
higher metastatic potential.58 Tumour invasion beyond the submucosa,
tumour grade G2–G3 and lymphovascular invasion are factors affecting
the risk of nodal metastases.
Despite very low grade evidence surgical resection may be indi-
cated in patients with dNETs showing any of the following features:
1. Tumour size >10 mm; (some centres may advocate endoscopic
removal in 10–15 mm).
2. Tumour extending beyond the submucosa.
3. Tumour grade G2–G3.
4. Lymphovascular invasion.
5. Functioning neoplasms.
Regarding the extent of resection, PD (pancreatoduodenectomy)
and LR (local resection) represent the two main alternatives:
In general, pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy is the
procedure of choice for ampullary/periampullary neoplasms, due to
their particular aggressiveness. When nodal metastases are pre- or
intraoperatively identified, PD with nodal dissection is indicated in order
to obtain a proper oncological clearance. However, for lesions <20 mm,
less aggressive approaches (i.e., local excision with lymphadenectomy or
pancreas-sparing total duodenectomy) may be considered options. At
least eight lymph nodes should be harvested to stage patients accu-
rately.59 However, radical surgery is associated with a high rate of
short- and long-term complications. Therefore, when feasible from an
oncological perspective, other surgical strategies should be considered.
Local duodenal resection (i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision
or enucleation) represents a valuable and safe option, especially for
patients with non-ampullary, non-functioning, dNET and without sus-
pected nodal involvement at staging,52 (where endoscopic resection is
not possible). The role of nodal dissection in this setting is unclear as
recent experience does not support the clearance of occult nodal
metastases due to lack of association with survival advantages.60
Recommendations. 1. Surgery is recommended in cases of size >10–
15 mm and/or tumour extending beyond the
submucosa and/or grade G2-G3 and/or lym-
phovascular invasion (3-B).

MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR
GASTRIC AND DUODENAL G2–G3
METASTATIC NETS
3.1
|
Treatment with curative intent
Due to the lack of effective systemic therapeutic options surgery
should be evaluated even in the presence of metastatic condition
depending on the tumour spread and tumour biology if a complete
tumour resection seems to be possible (R0-resection).
Gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy includes the removal of
locoregional lymph nodes, so the presence of locoregional lymph
node metastases should not preclude surgery as a treatment option.
In dNET a transduodenal tumour excision with lymph node sampling
or pancreatoduodenectomy are the treatments of choice.30 The com-
plete resection of single or multiple liver metastases might be benefi-
cial even for G3 tumours.61 Thus, surgical resection should be
evaluated in G2 and in very selected cases of G3-NET depending on
the general health condition of the patient. Single or multiple metas-
tases in other locations should be evaluated for a complete
resection.
3.2
|
Widespread metastatic disease
In the presence of metastases, a systemic therapeutic approach is
similar to that recommended for advanced/unresectable NET from
other primary sites, owing to the lack of available data in homoge-
neous series of gastric or duodenal NETs. Somatostatin analogues
are indicated for NETs G1–G2 with low Ki67 (<10%), and positive
somatostatin receptors but can be administered in tumours with
higher Ki-67 if slow tumour growth or slow progression are seen.
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid option
depending on the receptor status of the tumour. Molecular-
targeted therapy with everolimus is a therapeutic option, but with
limited
evidence.62
In
NET
G3
chemotherapy
should
be
administered.63
3.3
|
Palliative primary tumour resection
In cases of unresectable distant metastases a palliative primary
tumour resection can be considered rarely to avoid local complica-
tions. The kind and extent of surgery has to be evaluated depending
on the location of the tumour and possibility of complications of sur-
gery. A gastrectomy can be necessary in rare cases but a wedge resec-
tion, distal or subtotal gastric resection should be preferred to reduce
perioperative
morbidity.
A
gastric
bypass
without
tumour
re-
section should be favoured in case of bulky disease with infiltration of
the visceral arteries or pancreas.
3.4
|
Local recurrence
In the presence of local recurrence without diffuse metastatic spread,
operative resection should be favoured to avoid bleeding or intestinal
obstruction and to maintain quality of life. Even in the presence of dis-
tant metastatic spread palliative surgery should be considered to
ensure quality of life depending on the tumour biology and the gen-
eral health status of the patient. Endoscopic procedures such as stent
or jejunal catheterisation are alternatives for patients with a poor gen-
eral health status.

3.5
|
Follow-up
The interval for follow-up by contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT
and/or liver-MRI, 3–12 months, should be based on the malignant
potential of the tumour.64 Follow-up by additional 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT
is helpful when the patient's clinical status and the results of CT or
MRI and biochemistry are discordant. The sensitivity of 68Ga-SSA-
PET-CT is superior to contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT for
characterisation and detection of lymph node metastases and for visu-
alisation of metastases to bone and liver,65 and therefore provides
earlier detection of new lesions. FDG-PET/CT is instead used in G3
tumours and can also be helpful in high G2 NET when 68Ga-SSA-PET-
CT is negative. Re-evaluation of untreated patients should be per-
formed at 3–6 month intervals.
Recommendations
1. Surgery with curative intention of metastatic gastroduodenal NET
G1/G2/G3 should be performed, if a complete tumour (including
metastases) resection seems feasible (4-B).
2. Palliative surgery (primary resection, bypass) may be indicated in
metastatic disease to maintain quality of life (4-C).
3. The choice of systemic therapy for metastatic gastroduodenal NET
depends on tumour grading and includes biotherapy, everolimus,
PRRT and chemotherapy (4-B).

CONCLUSIONS
4.1
|
Gastric NETs
1. Evaluation of the type of gNETs by assessing separate biopsies
from the antral and fundic mucosa is needed.
2. Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger
than 1 cm, whereas a surgical approach should be proposed in
tumours larger than 2 cm. Tumours between 1 cm and 2 cm in size
are usually managed by endoscopic resection after EUS evaluation,
although surgery might be indicated in selected cases with G2
tumours and high Ki-67 (cutoff not established), and in G3
tumours.
3. In type III gNETs, a surgical approach is recommended. However,
in selected patients with small (<1 cm) G1 tumours, endoscopic re-
section may be appropriate.
4.2
|
Duodenal NETs
1. Endoscopic assessment should include tumour location to identify
periampullary tumours. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm.
2. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 may be removed using
EMR type techniques, whereas larger tumours (>1 cm) and/or
tumour extending beyond the submucosa and/or grades G2–G3
and/or lymphovascular invasion and/or functioning neoplasms
should be managed by a surgical approach after complete disease
staging by dedicated CT, liver-MRI+/ 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.
4.3
|
Unmet needs
1. The prognostic role of Ki67 in type I gNETs is unclear.
2. Long-term outcomes of endoscopic resection for both selected
gastric type 3 NETs, and also duodenal NETs, are lacking.
3. The risk of progression in low-grade gastroduodenal NETs after
incomplete R1 endoscopic resection is unknown.
4. The role of somatostatin analogue treatments in managing type I
gNETs has not yet been established.
5. More data are required regarding natural history PPI-induced
gNETs.
