INTRODUCTION
Merkel-cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare primary neuroendo-
crine carcinoma of the skin. It affects predominantly older,
fair-skinned Caucasians and exhibits aggressive behaviour
with a high recurrence rate and a propensity for early
metastasis.1 Despite new advances in therapies for MCC,
the prognosis remains poor. With the incidence of MCC
increasing rapidly across Europe, prompt diagnosis and
effective and harmonised management are imperative for
improving patient care.2
The European Parliament and the European Commission
recommend treating patients with rare cancers in centres
linked to the European Reference Network for Rare Adult
Solid Cancers (EURACAN). In these referral centres with a
high volume of MCC patients, the clinical experience of a
multidisciplinary team (MDT) specialising in skin cancers
guarantees better treatment outcomes and access to
clinical trials. Therefore, the objective of this guideline is to
provide a comprehensive reference for MCC, which is based
on a critical evaluation of current evidence and opinion of
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) experts in
partnership with EURACAN.
INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
The global incidence rates of MCC are difﬁcult to calculate
because of its rarity, geographic and demographic vari-
ability and lack of large epidemiological studies.3 Since its
ﬁrst description in 1972, MCC incidence rates have
steadily increased, likely due to both the reﬁnements in
diagnostic capabilities and the progressively ageing pop-
ulation.4,5 The Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe
(RARECARE) database reported the crude incidence esti-
mate as 0.13 per 100 000 in 1995-2002.6 The incidence
rate reported over time in the recent analysis of the
Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data-
base showed that in 1986, incidence and mortality rates
per 100 000 were 0.22 and 0.03, respectively; these rates
increased to 0.79 and 0.43, respectively, in 2011.7 The
highest incidence rates of MCC are in Australia, where the
age-adjusted incidence rate reported in Queensland was
1.6 per 100 000.8

MCC affects elderly (median age 76 years) Caucasian
males eight times more frequently than people of colour
and twice as often as females.9 MCC is correlated to
infection with the Merkel-cell polyomavirus (MCPyV),
exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light and/or immunosuppres-
sion [10% of patients are organ transplant recipients, pa-
tients
with
haematological
malignancies
or
human
immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) infection].10,11 In Europe and
North America, 80% of cases are caused by the integration
of MCPyV into the host genome, with the remaining 20%
caused by extensive UV-mediated damage. In Australia, this
is the opposite, with 80% UV- and 20% MCPyV-related.3
DIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Clinical diagnosis
The clinical examination must include a physical examina-
tion with the assessment of locoregional lymph nodes (LNs),
comorbid conditions and patient life expectancy. MCC
classically presents as a pink or red-violaceous, painless,
ﬁrm, rapidly growing, dome-shaped or red plaque skin
lesion, ranging in size from 1 to 2 cm. It typically occurs in
older patients in sun-exposed areas of their bodies. The
predominant sites of MCC localisation include the head and
neck (45%), upper limbs (24%), lower limbs (10%) and trunk
or other sites (<10%), while in 11% of cases, there is no
identiﬁable primary lesion. Ulceration may occur in more
advanced MCC lesions. MCC enlarges rapidly, metastasises
in transit to the skin and/or to ﬁrst-echelon LNs (26% of
cases at initial presentation) and then to higher-order nodal
regions and distant sites such as bones, liver and brain (8%
of cases at initial presentation).12 MCC may be mis-
diagnosed as squamous- or basal-cell carcinoma, amela-
notic melanoma, adnexal tumour, primary cutaneous B-cell
lymphoma or skin disorders such as pyogenic granuloma
and
inﬂammatory
disorders.13
Since
MCC
has
been
observed contiguous to, or intermingled with, other skin
cancers, the detection of polymorphous vessels and/or
milky-red areas by dermatoscopy enhances the differential
diagnostic accuracy, especially for patients with multiple
skin lesions.14
Aetiology and molecular biology
Despite major advances in understanding MCC carcino-
genesis, the cellular origin of MCC is still unclear. MCC has
been hypothesised to originate from dermal ﬁbroblasts,
pre-/pro-B cells, Merkel-cell precursors potentially derived
from epidermal stem cells and hair follicle stem cells.15 MCC
carcinogenesis can be initiated in the cell of origin either by
UV-mediated DNA damage caused by chronic exposure to
sunlight or by integration of the MCPyV into the host
genome.16,17 MCPyV is a ubiquitous virus usually acquired
during childhood, as indicated by frequent seropositivity of
antibodies against the capsid protein VP1 in the blood.18
However, primary infection with MCPyV does not cause
any discernible signs or symptoms. Despite the high prev-
alence of MCPyV infection, very few people develop MCC.
An essential feature of MCPyV-associated MCC is that the
tumour cells express speciﬁc products of the viral early
genes, i.e. small T antigen (ST) and a truncated version of
large T antigen (LT). LT and ST have also been referred to as
viral oncoproteins, and their capacity to interact with mul-
tiple cellular proteins, thereby altering their function, has
been demonstrated.19,20 While MCPyV-associated MCCs are
characterised by very low frequencies of somatic mutations,
virus-negative MCCs are among the tumours with the
highest mutational load, typically displaying UV signa-
tures.21 Among the aberrations found in MCPyV-negative
MCC,
mutations
disrupting
the
gene
encoding
the
retinoblastoma-associated protein RB1 (the key protein
controlling cell cycle entry) are almost always present.
Analogously, RB1 function in virus-associated MCC is
inhibited by binding the LXCXE motif of LT to RB1; in either
case, cells are unable to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle.21 Interestingly, MCPyV is not found in cases of MCC
associated with cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, indi-
cating that it does not play a part in these combined
tumours.22,23
Histopathology
Histopathological features of MCC are those of a small-blue-
round-cell tumour with a vesicular nucleus and scant
cytoplasm.24 However, several different histopathological
patterns exist, including trabecular, intermediate and small-
cell variants. Neoplastic cells can also be large and may
present with a pleomorphic morphology. The nucleoli are
multiple and usually not prominent. Mitotic and apoptotic
rates are frequently high. The tumour regularly inﬁltrates
the reticular dermis and subcutis. The epidermis, papillary
dermis and adnexal structures are usually spared, although
epidermotropism is observed in up to 10% of cases. The
presence of intra-lymphatic emboli and isolated tumour
cells close to the surgical margins may explain the high rate
of local recurrences.24,25 As the histomorphology of MCC on
haematoxylineeosin (H&E) sections is rather nonspeciﬁc,
the deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires immunohisto-
chemical staining to rule out other tumours that display a
small-blue-round-cell morphology (e.g. basal-cell carci-
noma; metastatic small-cell carcinoma, particularly from the
lung; cutaneous lymphoma; anaplastic sweat gland carci-
noma; melanoma; Ewing’s sarcoma; neuroblastoma and
rhabdomyosarcoma).24
MCC cells express several types of cytoskeletal keratins
(CKs), particularly CK20 (membranous and/or paranuclear
dot-like), CK8, CK18 and CK19. A small subset of MCCs
(<10%) are negative for CK20; these cases are characterised
by a high mutational burden and are generally not associ-
ated with MCPyV. In addition to CKs, neoplastic cells also
express chromogranin A, synaptophysin, cluster of differ-
entiation
(CD)56,
neuron-speciﬁc
enolase
(NSE)
and
huntingtin-interacting protein 1. MCC is usually negative for
thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), leukocyte common
antigen, melan A, mammalian achaete-scute homologue 1,
vimentin, protein S100 and CK7.23,24,26 However, rare cases

of MCC can be positive for TTF1 or CK7, and so interpre-
tation of the staining patterns of these two antigens should
be carried out with caution. These markers should be
included in an immunopanel for MCC conﬁrmation and
exclusion of other diagnostic considerations.
No histological marker has been reliably associated with
the selective identiﬁcation of either virus- or UV-associated
MCC: while positive staining for MCPyV LT strongly suggests
an MCPyV-associated MCC, negative staining does not
necessarily rule it out.27,28 Although all of these markers are
helpful and essential for diagnosis, particularly in the
presence of artefacts, no convincing evidence supports their
use to predict prognosis or response to therapy. Concerning
the latter, variable numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating cytotoxic
T lymphocytes (not identiﬁed, brisk, non-brisk) are found in
MCC tumours, and their presence is associated with a
better prognosis, which is particularly favourable if their T-
cell receptor repertoire is characterised by clonal diversity.29
The deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires histopatholog-
ical examination of tissue obtained by incisional/excisional
biopsy.4 The histology report after excisional biopsy should
include tumour size; the involvement of other tissues such
as fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical margins;
tumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratumoural
lymphocyte
inﬁltration;
immunohistochemical
proﬁle;
MCPyV status and mitotic rate.
Recommendations
 The clinical examination must include a physical examina-
tion with the assessment of locoregional LNs, comorbid
conditions and patient life expectancy [III, A].
 Histopathological MCC conﬁrmation should include H&E

STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT
The preferred classiﬁcation is the eighth version of the
Union
for
International
Cancer
Control
(UICC)
TNM
(tumourenodeemetastasis) staging and classiﬁcation sys-
tem, which provides information for both management and
prognosis of patients with MCC (see Supplementary
Tables
S1-S4,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.
esmoop.2024.102977).30 This classiﬁcation was developed
based on data collected from 9387 patients with MCC in the
National Cancer Database. Staging and risk assessment
procedures are determined based on disease presentation
at diagnosis.31
The initial evaluation in MCC should include a complete
examination of the skin with particular attention to any
suspicious cancerous skin lesions, tumour satellites, in-
transit metastases, regional LNs and systemic metastases.
The assessment of disease extension in all patients is
mandatory: ultrasound of regional LNs for patients with
clinical stage I-II disease and computed tomography (CT) of
the chest, abdomen and pelvis (and head/neck for head/
neck primaries).32 Positron emission tomography (PET)eCT
appears more sensitive than CT alone based on published
meta-analyses and other retrospective studies; it was
shown that 16.8% of patients who underwent PETeCT had
their disease upstaged compared with 6.9% of those who
underwent CT scans only.33,34 Therefore, if PET and/or PETe
CT with [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) are available,
they are the preferred cross-sectional imaging methods to
assess local and distant disease.16 If additional clinical
symptoms are present, detailed imaging studies using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be carried out.
Sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) with an appropriate immuno-
panel is considered the most reliable staging procedure for
identifying subclinical nodal involvement. As such, it is
recommended for all patients with clinically node-negative
disease who are ﬁt for radical therapy. SLNB should be
carried out alongside local surgical therapy of the primary
tumour with special attention to drainage patterns. The
observed 17.1% false-negative SLNB results may occur in
immunocompromised patients or tumours localised in the
head, neck or midline trunk region.35,36 SLNB enables the
detection of micrometastases in approximately one-third of
patients with clinically node-negative MCC, and its positivity
rate is w20% for T1 and 40%-50% for T2 MCCs.37-39 In
challenging locations for SLNB, single-photon emission
computed tomographyeCT techniques should be utilised.40
Access to a full pathological report with the number of
involved LNs, the size of metastatic deposits and the status
of the extracapsular extension is crucial for staging, pre-
diction and decision making.41 Patients with clinically
apparent nodal disease at presentation with an unknown
primary should have a biopsy for histological conﬁrmation
of MCC.12,42
The 5-year overall survival (OS) in all MCC patients is be-
tween 48% and 63%: 64% in patients without metastases
(stage I-II), 51% in those with regional LN involvement (stage
III), 68% in those with an unknown primary tumour and 17%-
29% in patients with distant metastases (stage IV).39,43-45
Retrospective data have shown that unfavourable clinical
prognostic factors are the presence of regional and distant
metastases, primary tumour diameter >2 cm and/or its
extension beyond the dermis, location in the head/neck
region, >75 years of age, male sex and presence of co-
morbidity, especially immunosuppression (e.g. HIV, chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia).3,39,43,46 The poor prognosis has
also been linked to histopathological futures such as posi-
tive margins after resection, a high mitotic rate, inﬁltrative
(rather than circumscribed) growth pattern, lymphovascular
inﬁltration and p63 expression, whereas LT and RB1 protein
expression and intratumoural CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltra-
tion correlate with a more favourable prognosis.10,12,24
However, there are no prospective data available in MCC.

is
frequently detected in MCC tumour cells and the tumour
microenvironment. Nevertheless, its expression does not
correlate with prognosis.47-49 Serum markers such as anti-
bodies against MCPyV or NSE require further prospective
validation.50,51
Recommendations
 SLNB is indicated to improve prognostic staging, e.g. to
rule out occult nodal disease, but the precision of
SLNB is less reliable in immunocompromised patients
and in patients whose tumours are located in the
head, neck or midline trunk region and with aberrant
LN drainage [III, A].
 Mandatory imaging studies comprise CT scans of the
chest, abdomen, pelvis and head/neck (for head/neck
primaries). If available, whole-body FDGePET/CT is pref-
erable over contrast-enhanced CT scan; MRI imaging of
speciﬁc organs should be carried out if clinically indi-
cated [III, A].
 The value of immunohistological markers, such as p63,
PD-L1, NSE or CD200, is not fully established [IV, B].
MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE
The mainstay of treatment for patients with localised MCC
is wide local excision (WLE) followed by tumour bed
radiotherapy (RT) and management of the nodal basin. A
proposed algorithm for the management of locoregional
MCC is shown in Figure 1.
Since wide excision can potentially compromise lymphatic
drainage, an SLNB should be carried out simultaneously with
surgical treatment of the primary MCC. A precise surgical
technique called Mohs surgery may be considered instead of
WLE in selected cases based on results from meta-analyses of
patients with stage I MCC, which showed similar recurrence
rates for both surgical modalities: local recurrence rates were
6.8% for WLE versus 8.5% for Mohs surgery, and regional
recurrence rates were similar at w15%, although no rando-
mised trials comparing traditional WLE with Mohs surgery
were included in these meta-analyses.52
After resection, there is a need to obtain a clear patho-
logical margin, although the size of surgical margin is under
debate.53 In one publication, a margin >2 cm was associ-
ated with a signiﬁcant improvement in OS54; however, other
data have not supported a correlation between margin size
beyond 1 cm and additional clinical beneﬁt. In a study of
6156 patients with localised MCC, resection margins >1 cm
were associated with improvements in OS compared with
margins of <1 cm; 5-year survival rates were 90% and 77%
(P < 0.001), respectively.55
According
to
ﬁndings
from
a
retrospective
study
comprising a cohort of patients who had clear margins
following resection and received post-operative RT, surgical
excision with margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus >1.0 cm was not
associated with any signiﬁcant difference in terms of OS,
any recurrence-free survival (RFS) or local RFS.56 Thus,
surgical margins might be reduced to avoid reconstruction,
especially for preserving cosmetics (face) or function (lo-
cations close to joints). Findings from this retrospective
study also showed that excision, even with narrow margins
(0.5-1.0 cm), was not associated with outcome. Cancer-
speciﬁc survival was 76.8% versus 76.2% for patients with
resection margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus 1-2 cm, respectively.
However, for patients with narrow resection margins, post-
operative RT to the tumour bed is mandatory.56 In sum-
mary, there is a need to obtain surgical margins of 1-2 cm
and histologically negative margins, if feasible, which must
be followed by adjuvant RT regardless of the type of sur-
gery.15,57-59
The beneﬁt of adjuvant RT following excision of the pri-
mary tumour was shown in a systematic review and meta-
analysis considering >17 000 patients with stages I-III MCC
from 29 observational studies.60 A favourable OS beneﬁt
was associated with surgery plus adjuvant RT versus surgery
alone [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)
0.75-0.86, P < 0.001]. The study also reported a signiﬁcant
beneﬁt in locoregional and local disease-free survival (DFS),
but not distant DFS (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.22-0.42; HR 0.21, 95%
CI 0.14-0.33 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49-1.14, respectively).60
The largest series to date to assess whether adjuvant
therapy was associated with better survival included 6908
cases from the National Cancer Database.61 It showed that
for localised MCC, surgery and adjuvant RT was associated
with a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in OS compared
with surgery alone (stage I: HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80; stage
II: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89), but in patients with regional
nodal metastases (stage III), neither the addition of adju-
vant RT nor chemotherapy (ChT) had a signiﬁcant impact on
OS. These ﬁndings suggest that the addition of RT may
beneﬁt the local control of localised disease; however, it is
reasonable to believe that survival in patients with more
advanced disease may be driven by the presence of sub-
clinical distant metastasis.61
It is worth noting that the MCC patient population con-
tains elderly patients, which frequently causes clinicians to
deviate from standard treatment protocols. This was
recently
illustrated
in
a
study
that
investigated
the
concordance to adjuvant treatment guidelines in patients
with stage I-II MCC.62 Of the 2330 patients in this study,
1858 had an indication for adjuvant RT [according to Na-
tional Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines
criteria63] but only 57% of these patients received RT; those
who received RT had a 5-year OS advantage over those who
did not (76% versus 68%, P < 0.0003). Conversely, of the
472 patients without an indication for adjuvant RT (ac-
cording to NCCN criteria), 43% received RT; this group did
not show an OS beneﬁt over those who did not receive RT
(79% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.48).62
The optimal adjuvant RT dose is unclear.64 In a retro-
spective study of 2093 patients who underwent surgery
followed by adjuvant RT, four groups of patients receiving
different doses of RT (30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy, 50-55 Gy and 55-
70 Gy) were analysed; the 3-year OS rates were 41.8%,
69.0%, 69.2% and 66.0%, respectively.65 An Australian study

documenting a dose response showed that no patients with
macroscopic MCC developed in-ﬁeld relapses at doses
>56 Gy.66 Furthermore, in a large population-based study
of patients with head and neck-located MCC (N ¼ 1625)
undergoing adjuvant RT (85% with negative margins and
15% with residual MCC), a dose range of 50-55 Gy conferred
a survival advantage compared with doses <50 Gy. There
was no signiﬁcant improvement by escalating doses beyond
this range, which could reﬂect toxicity-related morbidity or
death from competing risks in this mostly older patient
cohort.65 Therefore, a radiation dose of 50-60 Gy is often
recommended in MCC, achieving in-ﬁeld control.
In some patients, surgical therapy is not feasible due to
the extent of disease (technically inoperable) or the pres-
ence of signiﬁcant (co)morbidity. Since MCC is radiosensi-
tive, RT as a single modality is an alternative to surgery in
this group. The natural history of patients treated with
deﬁnitive RT is out-of-ﬁeld relapse with in-ﬁeld control
achieved in most patients.38 In a systematic review, an
almost 90% in-ﬁeld control rate was documented following
deﬁnitive RT with a mean dose delivered of just under
50 Gy.38 Recurrences occurred at 39/332 sites (13 local
relapses, 26 regional) for a cumulative post-RT in-ﬁeld
recurrence rate of 11.7%. Of note, there was no association
between RT dose and incidence of recurrence or non-
recurrence. RT of the primary tumour can also be curative
when excision is not possible due to severe comorbidity
disqualifying the patient from surgery or in individuals who
refuse surgical treatment.67 However, there is also a lack
of consensus regarding the optimal dose/fractionation
schedule. Independently, the European Consensus-based
interdisciplinary guideline and NCCN guidelines propose
doses of 60-66 Gy for deﬁnitive treatment of patients with
grossly positive primary tumour resection margins and/or
clinically evident lymphadenopathy.15,63
Management of early-stage MCC (stage I-II)

N0 M0 disease, adjuvant RT of the primary MCC site (50-60
Gy to the tumour bed) is recommended.15,68 In selected
cases with very-low-risk MCC (T1 N0 M0; <1 cm) and no
unfavourable prognostic factors, no additional RT may be
needed after WLE, but the decision should be made by
experts at high-volume referral centres.68 Extensive tissue
movement and grafting should be avoided if adjuvant RT is
planned.
After histologically conﬁrmed negative SLNB, the deci-
sion between observation and adjuvant RT to the nodal
basin must be made by the referral centre MDT after
considering the experience of the surgeon and conﬁdence
regarding the SLNB procedure.15 The purpose of SLNB is to
avoid unnecessary adjuvant treatment. In a review of
29 studies that included patients with stage I-II MCC, no
signiﬁcant difference in regional recurrence rate was
demonstrated with versus without adjuvant RT (14.3%
versus 4.6%, P ¼ 0.31).38 Furthermore, similar regional
nodal recurrence and OS rates were reported in a cohort
of 240 patients who underwent SLNB or elective LN
dissection
without
prior
pathological
nodal
staging
(P ¼ 0.056).69 However, in selected clinical situations,
there is value in adjuvant regional RT. It is recommended
in patients with profound immunosuppression, if SLNB is
not carried out or its accuracy is questionable [i.e.
anatomic compromise, aberrant LN drainage or the pres-
ence of multiple sentinel LN (SLN) basins which is typical
in head, neck or midline trunk MCC].70
Management of locoregional MCC (stage III)
Patients with stage III MCC have a competing risk of sys-
temic recurrence. On the other hand, in elderly patients,
severe comorbidity may lead to increased risk for intra-/
post-operative complications and higher morbidity related
to local therapy. Each decision on adjuvant therapy should
ideally be made within the conﬁnes of an MDT. In this sit-
uation, there is a recommendation to include patients in
clinical trials for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy when
available.
In the presence of microscopic metastasis detected on
SLNB or during node dissection [pathological stage IIIA: T1-
4, N1a, N1a(sn), M0], adjuvant RT alone or in combination
with complete LN dissection (CLND) may be considered and
requires an individualised approach. In a prospective study,
163 patients with SLN metastasis only underwent CLND or
RT, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in survival
outcomes (5-year OS: 71% versus 64%, P ¼ 1.0; DFS: 52%
versus 61%, P ¼ 0.8; nodal RFS: 76% versus 91%, P ¼ 0.3 or
distant relapse-free survival: 65% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.3,
respectively). With sufﬁcient in-ﬁeld control of macroscopic
MCC, in selected fragile patients who cannot tolerate nodal
excision under local anaesthesia, RT as monotherapy should
be considered.71 Another retrospective study of 447 pa-
tients with MCC and a positive SLNB collected in the Na-
tional Cancer Database showed that adjuvant RT  CLND
led to a survival beneﬁt compared with CLND alone or
observation.72 Therefore, in younger patients (<75 years of
age) with fewer comorbidities, a multidisciplinary approach
with adjuvant RT and CLND may be beneﬁcial. However, the
potential beneﬁt may be decreased by the potential com-
plications of CLND, such as lymphoedema, post-operative
wound infection, skin necrosis and wound dehiscence,
which is higher in the inguinal basin than in axillary
dissection (26% versus 9%, respectively).73
No randomised trials have evaluated the efﬁcacy of
adjuvant ChT or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with
MCC. Therefore, adjuvant ChT is not routinely indicated. The
data supporting CRT are derived from a retrospective study
of 4815 patients with head and neck MCC.74 In male pa-
tients with positive margins and a tumour size of >3 cm,
post-operative CRT and RT both provided a survival beneﬁt
compared with surgery alone (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81;
HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92, respectively).74 In a study of
6908 patients in the National Cancer Database, there was
no beneﬁt (or detriment) of giving adjuvant ChT to patients
with high-risk disease.61 In this fragile population, the risk of
serious side-effects is signiﬁcantly higher due to existing
comorbidities, and ChT-related mortality is between 4% and
8%. There is also a concern about the immunosuppressive
effects of ChT, which may lead to the development and
progression of MCC.75-77
A limited number of published case reports and series
have addressed MCC of unknown primary (pathological
stage IIIA: T0, N1b, M0). This group has a better outcome
than patients with known primary and synchronous nodal
metastases.12,42 The recommendation in this group is to
carry out a biopsy for pathological conﬁrmation of MCC,
FDGePETeCT to rule out distant metastatic disease and
management of the nodal lesions similar to that proposed
for stage IIIB MCC.
For patients with clinically positive nodal disease (path-
ological stage IIIB, T1-4, N1b-3, M0), cross-sectional imaging
is advised before surgery. There have been no prospective
trials evaluating the appropriate extent of CLND clearance
for MCC; in the absence of such evidence, it is recom-
mended to follow the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline
(CPG) for cutaneous melanoma.78 An analysis of the SEER
database incorporated propensity scoring and matched-pair
analysis and reported no difference in MCC-speciﬁc survival
in patients who received RT after CLND versus observa-
tion.79,80 In another study, Lewis et al. carried out a data-
base analysis encompassing 1254 patients and found
reductions in local and regional recurrences with similar
rates of distant metastases, but no statistical difference in
terms of OS and MCC-speciﬁc survival.81 Therefore, patients
with node-positive MCC should be considered for clinical
trials with (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy because neither
adjuvant RT nor ChT has been associated with a statistically
signiﬁcant impact on OS.61
Satellite or in-transit metastases (pathological stage IIIB,
T1-4, N2-3, M0) at post-operative histology are caused by
the cutaneous or subcutaneous intra-lymphatic spread. The
frequency is unclear but it is always associated with poor
survival.42,82,83 In bulky, multiple and/or frequently recur-
rent locoregional metastases, isolated limb perfusion may

be a safe and effective option.84 Overall and complete
response (CR) rates are w80% and 50%, respectively.84 The
recommended treatment for these locoregional metastases
in the absence of distant disease should consist of surgery
and/or RT or clinical trials, whereas adjuvant ChT is not
recommended.
The role of neoadjuvant or adjuvant immunotherapy in
the management of patients with MCC is currently under
investigation. In a phase I-II study (CheckMate 358) of
nivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting, surgical resection
was conducted after two doses of nivolumab 240 mg given
2 weeks apart.85 Among the 36 patients who underwent
surgery, 17 had a conﬁrmed pathological CR (pCR) and 18
had a partial response (PR) by radiological assessment. At a
median follow-up of 20 months, no patient with a pCR
experienced disease relapse. Additional studies are required
to conﬁrm the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and the
extent of surgery or post-operative RT in patients with a
pCR.85 In the adjuvant setting, although initial reports failed
to show a therapeutic beneﬁt with ipilimumab as adjuvant
monotherapy, interim results from a prospective rando-
mised study suggest a beneﬁt in terms of DFS for the pro-
grammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab.
However, ﬁnal results from prospective randomised trials
are required to determine the true beneﬁts of adjuvant PD-
(L)1 blockade.86
Recommendations
 An MDT meeting comprising experts with signiﬁcant
MCC experience should be convened to diagnose and
make decisions about therapy; the preferred option is
participation in clinical trials [III, A].
Management of local/locoregional disease (stage I-III)
 After excisional biopsy, WLE with a margin of 1-2 cm
is considered adequate; if a resection margin of
1-2 cm is not technically achievable, a narrower
margin (0.5-1.0 cm) with adjuvant RT may also be
acceptable [IV, B].
 Adjuvant RT with 50-60 Gy to the tumour bed is recom-
mended for tumours of 1 cm in diameter and/or with
negative prognostic features (stage IB) [IV, A].
 In patients at very low risk of locoregional recurrence
(stage IA), clinical observation may be an alternative
but such a decision should only be made at referral cen-
tres [V, A].
 When WLE is not feasible, deﬁnitive RT of the primary
tumour is an alternative approach [V, B].
Management of early-stage MCC (stage I-II; T1-4 N0 M0
disease)
 SLNB should be carried out during local surgical therapy
of the primary tumour with special attention to drainage
patterns [III, A].
 In patients with a negative SLNB, observation is an op-
tion, but in case of a risk of false negativity of SLNB or
when SLNB is not carried out, adjuvant RT to the primary
site and nodal basin may be considered. This decision
must only be made at referral centres [IV, B].
Management of locoregional MCC (stage III; T1-4 N1-3 M0
disease)
 After a positive SLNB, adjuvant RT alone or in combina-
tion with CLND is recommended after an MDT discussion
[IV, B].
 In clinically positive LNs, multiple nodal involvements or
extra-nodal extension of the SLN, regional LN dissection
with post-operative RT is recommended (or deﬁnitive RT
in inoperable patients) [III, B].
 Adjuvant ChT is not recommended [IV, D]; patients should
be considered for clinical trials with (neo)adjuvant sys-
temic therapy of modern immunotherapies [III, A].
MANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE
Despite the recent advances in diagnosis and treatment,
inoperable stage III and IV MCC remain incurable. Admin-
istration of immunotherapy in the ﬁrst-/second-line settings
is recommended (if there is no contraindication for immu-
notherapy).87,88 ChT, palliative RT, best supportive care or
participation in clinical trials should be considered based on
the clinical situation. In patients with recurrent oligometa-
static and resectable disease, surgical removal or stereo-
tactic irradiation of metastases can be considered if
systemic immunotherapy is contraindicated or the disease
is refractory. A proposed algorithm for the management of
inoperable stage III and IV MCC is shown in Figure 2.
Immunotherapy
PD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors are effective in the treatment
of metastatic MCC.89 These drugs allow the reactivation of T
lymphocytes and the triggering of the adaptive immune
system by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 of the
tumour
microenvironment
and
PD-1
expressed
on
lymphocyte surfaces. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 restores the
antitumour activity of effector T cells and the function of
exhausted T cells.89
Despite their proven efﬁcacy, resistance to immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can occur due to different
mechanisms: intrinsic resistance in patients who do not
respond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or acquired resistance in
patients
whose
tumours
progress
after
the
initial
response.90-92 Open questions regarding the immunogenic
characteristics
of
both
MCPyV-positive
and
-negative
Merkel-cell tumours and the lack of predictive biomarkers
of response to treatment are still under evaluation. Clinical
beneﬁt was not associated with any other biomarker eval-
uated to date, such as PD-L1, MCPyV status, tumour
mutational burden or CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltration.90-92
Immunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab [ESMO-

pean Medicines Agency (EMA) approved], pembrolizumab

mab (not EMA or FDA approved), have shown high
response rates both as ﬁrst- and second-line treatments,

with long response durations and greater long-term ben-
eﬁts, when indirectly compared with ChT. Therefore,
immunotherapy is recommended in this setting if no
contraindications exist.
The ideal duration of ICI therapy is currently unknown.
One retrospective analysis of data collected at a single
institute showed that among 65 patients treated with
avelumab, 25 had an FDGePETeCT-conﬁrmed CR. The 12-
month RFS rate in these patients was 88% (95% CI 0.74-
1.0). Reasons for stopping treatment included completion
of 1 year of treatment (13 patients), toxicity (5 patients) and
patient preference (7 patients).93 Prospective data from
larger patient cohorts and with longer follow-up are
therefore required to conﬁrm the ideal duration of ICI
therapy in patients with MCC.
Avelumab. The efﬁcacy and safety of avelumab, an anti-PD-
L1 inhibitor, were analysed in the JAVELIN Merkel 200 study,
which was divided into parts A and B.94,95 Part A included
88 patients with metastatic MCC who progressed after at
least one line of ChT. After >2 years of follow-up, the
objective response rate (ORR) was 33.0% (11.4% CR), me-
dian duration of response (DoR) was 40.5 months and the
DoR was >2 years in 67.0% of responders.90,94,95 In part B,
patients who had not received prior systemic treatment for
metastatic disease were enrolled; the ORR was 39.7%
(16.4% CR) with 30.2% having a response lasting >6
months; the median OS was 20.3 months. First-line avelu-
mab treatment was generally well-tolerated, and no
treatment-related deaths or grade 4 adverse events (AEs)
occurred.
In
the
pretreated
population,
grade
3-4
treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were observed in 11.4% of
patients. From December 2015 to March 2019, 494 patients
received avelumab as a ﬁrst- or second-line treatment for
MCC within an expanded access programme (EAP); the ORR
was 46.7% (22.9% CR) and the disease control rate was
71.2%. Avelumab was also associated with long-lasting
disease
control
and
a
positive
effect
on
OS.90,94,95
Emerging real-world data suggest that outcomes with ave-
lumab in clinical practice are in line with those seen in
clinical trials.96 Recently published global data from EAPs
and retrospective studies reported ORRs ranging from
29.1% to 72.1% [CR 15.8%-37.2%; PR 18.2%-42.1% and
stable disease (SD) 7.1%-30.9%], with median progression-
free survival (PFS) ranging from 8.1 to 24.1 months.
Importantly, immunosuppressed patients also beneﬁted
from avelumab, with response rates equivalent to the
general population. The best outcomes were achieved when
avelumab was given as ﬁrst-line therapy. The most common
AEs were fatigue and infusion-related reactions; autoim-
mune hepatitis and thyroiditis were also observed.97
Pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab, a humanised immuno-
globulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that selectively
binds PD-1 on the surface of T lymphocytes, has been
tested as a ﬁrst-line treatment in patients with MCC.98,99 In
a phase II clinical trial (KEYNOTE-017), 50 patients received
pembrolizumab for up to 2 years. TRAEs of any grade
occurred in 49 of 50 patients (98%) and 15 patients (30%)
had grade 3 TRAEs with one death due to pericardial and
pleural effusion. The ORR was 58%, with 30% of patients
achieving a CR. At 3 years, the PFS was 39.1% with a median
PFS of 16.8 months; the 3-year OS rate was 59.4%, with a
median OS not reached.99 Age, gender, baseline tumour
burden, anatomic sites of metastasis and tumour PD-L1
expression and viral status expression did not correlate
with ORR, PFS or OS.98,99
Nivolumab. Nivolumab, a fully human anti-PD-1 IgG4
monoclonal antibody, was evaluated in two prospective
studies in combination with ipilimumab. A randomised,
open-label, phase II trial showed that in 50 patients
[including 26 who had received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy],
nivolumabeipilimumab [with half of the patients also
receiving stereotactic body RT (SBRT) (24 Gy in three frac-
tions)] was associated with a high response rate and an

expected safety proﬁle.100 A CR was achieved in 41% of ICI-
naive patients and in 15% of ICI-exposed patients; however,
SBRT did not inﬂuence ORR. Although the effectiveness of
nivolumabeipilimumab looks promising, data are immature
and limited to a small sample size. It is also important to
consider the signiﬁcant risk of severe AEs in the elderly MCC
population. Findings from the phase I/II CheckMate 358
trial also suggest that nivolumab is active as monotherapy
in patients with advanced MCC. Among 25 treated patients
(22 assessable), the ORR was 68% and the 3-month PFS and
OS rates were 82% and 92%, respectively.77
Retifanlimab. Retifanlimab is a humanised, hinge-stabilised
IgG4k, anti-PD-1 antibody that is EMA and FDA approved
for the treatment of metastatic or recurrent locally
advanced MCC not amenable to curative surgery or RT
based on data from the phase II POD1UM-201 trial. In this
trial, retifanlimab treatment resulted in an ORR of 52% (95%
CI 40% to 65%) in ChT-naive patients (N ¼ 65; CR 18% and
PR 34%) with a median DoR between 1.1 months and >24.9
months. Twenty-two
percent
of
patients
experienced
serious TRAEs, including fatigue, arrhythmia and pneumo-
nitis, and 11% discontinued therapy due to AEs (the most
common AEs were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus,
diarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and nausea).101
ChT
As there are no randomised trials in patients with MCC and
distant metastases, the impact of systemic ChT on survival is
unclear. To date, available data are insufﬁcient to determine
which of the different ChT regimens ensures the best PFS
and OS in patients with metastatic MCC.
ChT regimens that have been used to treat patients with
MCC include taxanes, topotecan, a combination of etopo-
sideecisplatin, etoposideecarboplatin or cyclophosphamidee
doxorubicinevincristine.102 Response rates ranged from 20%
to 75%, with higher response rates in the ﬁrst-line setting
(53%-61%) versus the second-line setting (23%-45%); among
responders, the median DoRs were w2-9 months.76,103,104
Unfortunately, in this fragile, elderly population, the occur-
rence of toxic deaths limits ChT usage; toxic deaths were
observed in 3%-10% of patients.76,103,104 However, ChT might
be proposed after failure on immunotherapy or when
immunotherapy is contraindicated.
Targeted therapies
In the UKMCC-01 trial, the efﬁcacy of pazopanib was
assessed in 16 patients with MCC and a median age of 73
years (range 56-90 years).105 A clinical beneﬁt was reported
in nine patients (three had a PR and six had SD) with a
median duration of 8.0 weeks (range 1.3-38.4 weeks). The
trial was stopped due to slow accrual.105 A lack of activity
and limited tolerance were also shown in a phase II trial
with cabozantinib in patients with recurrent/metastatic
MCC after platinum failure.106 Based on published results,
the use of targeted therapy is not recommended.
With regard to radioligand therapy, although MCC
frequently
expresses
somatostatin
receptors,
Ga68-
DOTATOC and Lu177-DOTATATE have only been studied
in a few patients and further clinical trials are needed to
determine their role in MCC.102,107 As such, they should not
currently be considered as a standard of care.
Palliative RT
Palliative RT has mainly been assessed retrospectively. In a
study applying an 8-Gy single fraction, a CR with almost 80%
of in-ﬁeld lesion control was documented in 45% of pa-
tients.87 Another study comparing 8 Gy as a single or
multiple fractions (3  8 Gy) documented a CR in 10%
versus 48% and a recurrence rate of 41% versus 5% (P ¼
0.04), respectively.108 Patients of poor performance status
should be considered for a lower dose hypofractionation
schedule (e.g. 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions),
which can still achieve tumour regression.
Recommendations
 Patients should receive individualised multimodality
treatment in referral centres for rare skin cancers with
access to clinical trials [III, B].
 In oligometastatic disease progression, surgical removal
or stereotactic irradiation of operable locoregional recur-
rence or a single distant metastasis should be considered
in ﬁt patients, although systemic immunotherapy should
be considered as the ﬁrst step [V, B].
 Immunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab (III, A;
ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4; FDA and EMA approved),
pembrolizumab (III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA
approved, not EMA approved), retifanlimab (III, A; FDA
and EMA approved) and nivolumab (III, A; not EMA or
FDA approved), are recommended as ﬁrst- and second-
line treatments if no contraindications exist.
 In cases of inoperable/disseminated disease, ﬁrst-line
treatment with an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody is suggested
as it is more effective and safer than ChT [II, B].
 In patients with contraindications or after failure of
immunotherapy, palliative RT and/or ChT may be op-
tions, but their impact on OS is uncertain [III, B].
POPULATIONS OF SPECIAL CONSIDERATION
Since MCC is present mainly in elderly patients, use of
geriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity assessments
are important for decision making to achieve disease con-
trol and assure an acceptable quality of life. For patients
who are not medical candidates for surgery, RT alone may
be considered. However, in patients with inoperable/met-
astatic disease, given the relatively good tolerability of ICIs,
these agents are the preferred choice of systemic therapy
for this subset of patients.

FOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND
SURVIVORSHIP
After primary surgical excision, local recurrence develops in
27%-60% of patients, regional nodal involvement is reported
in 45%-91% of patients and distant metastases are found in
18%-52%.42,109,110 Risk factors for recurrence include immu-
nosuppression, advancing age, advancing stage of disease
(stage II-IV), individuals assigned male at birth, non-SLN
metastases, MCPyV-negative status, as well as additional
factors as determined by the treating physicians. No formal
clinical
trials
have
evaluated
the
optimal
surveillance
schedule in MCC, either in terms of frequency or type of
diagnostic examinations. As the risk of relapse is higher in the
ﬁrst 2-3 years after initial treatment (40%-50% nodal and 33%
distant metastases),15 more intense follow-up should be
applied in this period. Follow-up examinations are recom-
mended every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, and then
every 6 months until year 5. After 5 years of observation, a
general physical examination is recommended every 12
months lifelong, including a complete skin check-up. Physical
examination should include total-body skin examination and
LN assessment with particular attention to the scar region,
including the primary site, in-transit region and regional LN
basin. Distant metastases may develop in a wide range of
anatomical locations; thus, routine cross-sectional imaging
may be proposed in higher-risk patients.
The radiological examination may be either a diagnostic CT
of the thorax/abdomen/pelvis (and head/neck for patients
with head and neck primaries) or whole-body PETeCT, un-
dertaken every 6-12 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, with ul-
trasound scans used for local LN assessment. After year 3,
imaging studies should be carried out as clinically indicated.
Patients with MCC have a higher risk for developing another
skin cancer9,15,39,111,112; therefore, education regarding self-
examination of the whole skin surface is valuable. The role
of MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncertain but it
may be utilised in patients who are seropositive at base-
line.50,113,114 The early detection of a locoregional relapse
may be cured by surgery. However, inoperable/metastatic
relapse should be treated as metastatic disease, as described
in the previous section.115-117 Therapy should be coordinated
by an MDT at the referral centre.87,118,119
Recommendations
 Follow-up examinations are recommended in radically
treated patients every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years,
and then every 6 months up to year 5. After 5 years of
observation,
a
general
physical
examination
is
recommended every 12 months lifelong, including a
complete skin check-up [IV, A].
 Patient education regarding self-examination of the
whole skin is valuable as patients with MCC have a
higher risk of developing another skin cancer [IV, A].
 The role of MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncer-
tain, but it may be utilised in patients who are seropos-
itive at baseline [V, A].
 Routine cross-sectional imaging may be proposed in
higher-risk patients [IV, A].
METHODOLOGY
This CPG has been developed by ESMO in partnership with
EURACAN, in accordance with the ESMO standard operating
procedures for CPG development (http://www.esmo.org/
Guidelines/ESMO-GuidelinesMethodology).
The
relevant
literature has been selected by the expert authors. The
guideline is conceived to provide a standard approach to
diagnosis, treatment and survivorship of MCC. Due to the
rarity of MCC incidence, prospective and randomised
studies are limited; therefore, the basis of this guideline was
mainly
data
from
retrospective,
observational
cohort
studies, both institutional and cancer registry-based, often
with heterogeneous results. These studies have many limi-
tations, such as selection bias, confounding factors, limited
and missing data and lack of randomisation. Recommended
interventions are intended to correspond to the ‘standard’
approaches according to current consensus among the Eu-
ropean multidisciplinary MCC community of experts. These
are represented by the members of the ESMO Melanoma
Faculty and experts appointed by all institutions belonging
to the Rare Skin Cancer domain of EURACAN. Experimental
interventions considered to be beneﬁcial are labelled as
‘investigational’. Other non-standard approaches may be
proposed to the single patient as ‘options’ for a shared
patientephysician decision in conditions of uncertainty as
long as some supporting evidence (though not conclusive) is
available. Algorithms accompany the text, covering the
main typical presentations of disease, and are meant to
guide the user throughout the text. An ESMO-MCBS table
with ESMO-MCBS scores is included in Supplementary
Table S5, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.

scores for new therapies/indications approved by the EMA
and/or the FDA (https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-
MCBS). The scores have been calculated and validated by
the ESMO-MCBS Working Group and reviewed by the au-
