INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Two different primary malignancies can arise from the ad-
renal gland: adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) from the adrenal
cortex and malignant phaeochromocytoma from the adrenal
medulla. Both malignancies are rare. ACC has an estimated
incidence of w0.5-2 new cases per million people per year.1,2
Phaeochromocytomas are catecholamine-producing neuro-
endocrine tumours arising from chromafﬁn cells of the
adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia. The latter are
usually called paraganglioma, leading to the combined term
phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs). The
detected incidence of PPGLs is commonly reported at 2-8 per
million per year3 (supplementary information, available at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).
All patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL
should be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team
meeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis (ideally
before surgery) and in case of progressive disease.
DIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Every patient with (suspected) ACC or PPGL should undergo
careful clinical assessment, including case history, clinical
examination for symptoms and signs of adrenal hormone
excess. For more details on this topic, we refer to more
comprehensive guidelines and reviews.3-8
Hormonal evaluation
The aims of hormonal evaluation are multiple: (i) hormone
assays provide orientation to the nature of the adrenal
mass and can be useful to assess presence of malignancy;
(ii) a phaeochromocytoma should always be ruled out,
because these tumours can induce life-threatening crises,
requiring speciﬁc management before any intervention; (iii)
massive adrenocortical steroid excess can impact short-
term survival and quality of life (QoL), requiring speciﬁc
treatments to block impacts of hormonal excess; (iv)
abnormal hormone secretions may serve as biological
markers for the follow-up of patients; (v) in case of large
bilateral adrenal masses, a systematic assessment of adre-
nal function is recommended to rule out adrenal insufﬁ-
ciency. Precise hormone assays have been detailed in recent
guideline statements,4,5,9,10 and are summarised in Table 1.
For all adrenal masses, the diagnosis of phaeochro-
mocytoma
should
be

assessed

measuring
plasma-free
or
urinary-fractionated
meta-
nephrines [V, A].5,10 Additional measurements of plasma
methoxytyramine, a biomarker now increasingly available,
provide useful information to assess the likelihood of
malignancy.11 In cases of suspected ACC, an extensive
steroid hormone work-up is recommended, assessing
gluco-, mineralo-, sex- and precursor-steroids ([V, B]
(Table 1)).12-16
Imaging
For best patient care, adequate visualisation of the tumour
and potential metastases is essential. For differential diag-
nosis of an adrenal mass, computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both effective [IV, A].
Although these methods cannot determine the exact entity
of the mass, both are able to correctly diagnose a subset of
benign tumoursdat least when carried out according to
state-of-the-art criteria. The single best criterion to diagnose
a benign tumour (e.g. adenoma) remains Hounsﬁeld units
10 in an unenhanced CT.17 However, other imaging
criteria, such as rapid washout in 10- or 15-min delayed
contrast-enhanced CT, signal intensity loss using opposed-
phase MRI, and low 2-ﬂuorine-18 [18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-
glucose (FDG) uptake in [18F]FDG-positron electron to-
mography (PET)/CT are also suggestive of a benign tumour.
Most ACCs show an inhomogeneous appearance in CT or
MRI with irregular margins and irregular enhancement of
solid components after intravenous injection of contrasted
agent. Detection of local invasion or tumour extension into
the inferior vena cava, as well as lymph node or other
metastasesdincluding lung and liverdis mandatory before
planning any surgery. Therefore, cross-sectional imaging
of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is required preoperatively
[V, A].
For PPGLs, conventional radiological imaging can be
important to determine the presence of metastases. How-
ever, neither CT nor MRI can be used to determine whether
PPGLs are benign or malignant. Malignancy can only be
determined from the presence of metastatic lesions at sites
where chromafﬁn cells are normally absent. Without such
evidence, all PPGLs should be considered potentially ma-
lignant, with risk dependent on several factors as outlined
below.
There are a number of functional imaging modalities
available for patients with PPGLs (supplementary File,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.
2099). The indication is twofold: (i) best tumour staging in
patients with suspected metastases (e.g. by conventional
imaging) or with presumably high risk for metastases; (ii) to
evaluate the option of a radionuclide-based therapy in pa-
tients with nonresectable PPGL. For assessments of meta-
static risk for the ﬁrst indication the authors suggest the
presence of one or more of the following criteria:
 tumour size 5 cm;
 any extra-adrenal paraganglioma;
 known succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur
subunit B (SDHB) germline mutation; or
 plasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above
the upper cut-offs of reference intervals.
For imaging-based diagnosis of metastatic PPGLs, it is
important to avoid confusing metastases with multiple
primary tumours that often occur in patients with heredi-
tary PPGL syndromes. Additionally, local recurrences should
not be misdiagnosed as metastases.
Pathology
Biopsy of adrenal tumours is usually contraindicated
because of the risk of tumour spillage, poor diagnostic po-
wer to discriminate benign from malignant adrenocortical
tumours and risk of hypertensive crises in phaeochromo-
cytoma. However, a biopsy might be indicated in an adrenal
mass without any hormone excess in patients with a history
of extra-adrenal cancers to exclude or prove an adrenal
metastasis of an extra-adrenal malignancy, and in patients
in whom tumour sequencing is desired.
The pathological differential diagnosis of adrenal neo-
plasias in both biopsied and resected specimens is primarily
based on morphological features requiring an experienced
pathologist [IV, A]. Preferably, a panel of immunohisto-
chemical markers should be applied to aid diagnosis; for
example, steroidogenesis factor 1 (SF1) or, alternatively,
inhibin-alpha, calretinin and melan-A for identiﬁcation of
adrenocortical tumours and chromogranin A for identiﬁca-
tion of PPGL [IV, A]. Staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and
synaptophysin may also be helpful to highlight PPGL, but
positive results for synaptophysin are also possible in
adrenocortical tumours. The differential diagnosis between
ACC and adenoma may be challenging as no single marker
indicates malignancy. The most widely used diagnostic score
has been introduced by Weiss18,19 and includes nine pa-
rameters (supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.
org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099) [IV, A]. A score of 3
suggests malignancy. In addition, the Ki-67 labelling index,
as a marker of proliferative activity, may be useful and is
very
helpful
for
prognostic
purposes
(supplementary
Tables S2 and S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.
annonc.2020.08.2099).
For phaeochromocytomas, the situation is similarly
demanding. Tumour size, SDHB mutation status, extra-
adrenal location and plasma methoxytyramine may all be
used to indicate riskof metastasis. However,there is no single
histological or immunohistochemical parameter that can
predict the clinical behaviour of PPGL. Nevertheless, several
histological scoring systems have been developed.20-23 All
these scores have value but none of them has reached
general acceptance. Therefore, according to the current
World Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcation, all PPGLs
should be considered to have some malignant potential.24 A
deﬁnitive diagnosis of malignancy can only be made by the
presence of metastases at sites where chromafﬁn tissue is
normally absent (e.g. liver, bone, lungs or lymph nodes),
assessed by pathology or imaging, in particular functional
imaging.

Molecular biology
Molecular characterisation of ACC (supplementary File,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.
2099) and PPGL is an active area of ongoing research. The
gene encoding subunit B of the SDHB complex is by far the
most important molecular contributor to malignant PPGL,
with at least 40% of all cases of metastatic PPGLs carrying
mutations of this gene.25 Inactivation of SDHB reduces
function of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, leading
to activation of the hypoxia-inducible pathway and a
pseudohypoxic state characterised by increased angiogen-
esis, growth and expression of mitogenic factors,26 but also
to DNA hypermethylation, which is believed to provide a
further drive to metastatic progression.27
At least 35% of PPGLs result from germline mutations of
over 18 tumour-susceptibility genes identiﬁed to date,28-33
with those resulting in stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible fac-
tors 1a and 2a (HIF1a and HIF2a) carrying a higher risk of
metastatic disease than those due to other mutations
(supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). Risk is particularly high, reach-
ing 70% in patients with PPGL due to mutations in the SDHB
gene.34 The vast majority of all metastatic PPGLs, including
disease due to SDHB mutations, develop from noradrenergic
or dopaminergic PPGLs with poorly developed secretory
pathways. Nevertheless, a small minority of about 10% of
metastatic PPGLs develop from adrenal adrenergic tumours
that are characterised by production of epinephrine, as man-
ifested by increased plasma or urinary metanephrine.35
Of note, metastatic disease may only become apparent
many years after the primary tumour is resected. This and
later development in some patients of locally recurrent
disease underscore the importance of recommendations for
follow-up of all patients with previously resected PPGLs.9

 Biopsies of suspected ACC are usually not informative

ment of plasma or urinary metanephrines [V, A]. Suspi-
cion of disease is primarily based on (i) the presence
of signs, symptoms or other manifestations of presumed
catecholamine excess; (ii) incidental adrenal mass; or (iii)
routine screening due to high risk associated with hered-
itary predisposition or history of PPGLs.

tion above), a chest CT and at least one functional

circumstances.

STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT
ACC
In the assessment of disease stage, the authors recommend
the tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation proposed
by the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours
(ENSAT) (supplementary Table S5, available at https://doi.
org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099) [IV, A],36 because this
system seems to be superior to other staging systems and is
adapted by the Union for International Cancer Control
(UICC) and WHO.24 As indicated above for correct staging,
at least a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (or FDG-PET/
CT including full-dose CT) is required. Recent data suggest
that lymph node involvement correlates with stage IV
rather than stage III behaviour.37
Overall, the prognosis of ACC is limited. However, pro-
spective data suggest that in patients with complete
resection of a localised stage II tumour 5-year overall sur-
vival (OS) can be as high as 90%.38 In metastatic ACC, me-
dian survival is about 15 months. However, even in this
group, there is a subgroup of patients with long-term
survival.36,37
It is well established that disease stage and margin-free
resection are currently the most important prognostic fac-
tors in ACC. For the European Society of Endocrinology
(ESE)eENSAT guidelines, a comprehensive literature search
for prognostic factors has been carried out and only the
proliferation marker Ki-67 and glucocorticoid excess showed
a robust association with prognosis [IV, A] (supplementary
Table S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.
08.2099).4,39 Many other (molecular) markers for aggres-
siveness and survival have been recently proposed, but their
clinical use requires validation.
PPGL
In 2017,the WHO proposed a tumourstaging system for PPGL
(supplementary Table S6, available at https://doi.org/10.1
016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).24 Although this staging classi-
ﬁcation remains to be validated, the authors recommend
using this system to harmonise disease classiﬁcation.
Despite limitations, the authors suggest assessing the risk
of metastatic disease in an individualised manner, taking into
account previous history of disease and the presence or
absence of a germline mutation of a tumour-susceptibility
gene (supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/
10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). For ﬁrst-time patients
without any history of disease or known mutation, size and
location of the primary tumour, and when available, any el-
evations of plasma methoxytyramine during biochemical
testing seem important to consider when evaluating risk
for malignancy. As described above, the authors suggest
establishing ‘high risk of metastases’ when any patient pre-
sents with one or more of the following criteria: (i) adrenal
phaeochromocytoma 5 cm; (ii) an extra-adrenal para-
ganglioma; (iii) a known SDHB germline mutation; or (iv)
plasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above the
upper limit of reference intervals. In these patients, whole-
body functional imaging may be justiﬁed, particularly for
cases involving more than one of those four criteria.
Recommendations
 The ENSAT TNM system should be used for initial staging
of ACC [IV, A].
 Genetic counselling should be offered to all patients with
PPGL.
MANAGEMENT OF LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE
Surgery
Surgery is essential for treatment of both ACC and phaeo-
chromocytoma. Adrenal surgery should be carried out only
by surgeons with appropriate expertise and experience. The
lack of consensus on what is deﬁned as appropriate expe-
rience and the absence of evidence that a speciﬁc experi-
ence in adrenal surgery translates into improved outcomes
limit any recommendations concerning this issue.40-42 The
recent ESEeENSAT guidelines on ACC suggest a minimal
annual workload of six adrenalectomies per year, but with
a preference for >20 surgeries per year. In addition to
expertise in adrenal surgery, sufﬁcient experience in onco-
logical surgery is essential [V, B].4 For best clinical outcome,
the entire operative team (including anaesthesiologists)
should be well-trained in adrenal surgery.

ACC. Open surgery with transperitoneal access is the stan-
dard treatment for all patients with localised (stage I-II) and
locally advanced (stage III) ACC when complete resection
can be achieved (Figure 1).4,43 Resection status (R0, R1, R2)
is a major predictor of prognosis for ACC. Therefore, a
margin-free complete resection (R0 resection) is key to
achieving long-term survival [V, A].2,44 In order to obtain an
R0 resection of a locally advanced ACC, it may be necessary
to resect (parts of) adjacent organs such as the wall of the
vena cava, liver, spleen, colon, pancreas and/or stomach [V,
B]. Complete en bloc resection of the tumoural mass,
including periadrenal fat and adjacent organs if necessary, is
mandatory to avoid tumour rupture or spillage that por-
tends an adverse outcome.45 Locoregional lymphadenec-
tomy improves tumour staging and seems to lead to a
favourable oncological outcome.46
Routine lymphadenectomy should include at least the
periadrenal and hilar nodes [IV, A], although the best extent

of lymphadenectomy is still unknown.47 For ACC tumours
not invading the kidney, concomitant nephrectomy does
not seem to improve disease-free survival and OS48 and can
be avoided, although additional data are needed [V, B].
In experienced hands, laparoscopic adrenalectomy seems
to be a safe and effective procedure in a selected group of
patients with small ACC without evidence for local inva-
siveness,4,43 although this is still a matter of debate because
prospective comparative studies are scarce. In current
practice, adrenal masses (e.g. incidentalomas) that are
judged as only potentially malignant are often approached
by laparoscopic adrenalectomy. However, this technique
must be carried out only in centres with consolidated
experience in laparoscopic adrenal surgery, in which the
principles of oncological surgical treatment are strictly
respected and prospective registration of cases is organised
[IV, C].4,43 There is no evidence for the superiority of the
transperitoneal over the retroperitoneal approach in the
literature. If during laparoscopic surgery, an involvement of
the surrounding tissues is discovered, or there is a risk of

spillage, capsule injury or incomplete resection, immediate
conversion to an open approach is required.43
As hormonal hypersecretion can increase the risk of peri-
operative complications, it is important to adopt measures
to prevent postoperative adrenal crisis or insufﬁciency. In all
patients with glucocorticoid excess, either overt or ‘subclin-
ical’, hydrocortisone must be administered during surgery
(e.g. 150 mg/day) and postoperatively [V, A].4 Hormone
hypersecretion, in particular cortisol excess, may portend
an increased risk of recurrence after complete tumour
removal.39,49
Adjuvant treatment
More than half of the ACC patients who have undergone
complete removal of the tumour have a relapse risk, often
with metastases. This aggressive behaviour provides the
rationale for the use of adjuvant therapy. Mitotane has
been the reference drug for the management of ACC for
decades and is increasingly used also in adjuvant settings
following surgical removal of ACC. However, the value of
this approach remains a matter of controversy because only
a few studies have compared sufﬁciently large cohorts of
treated and control patients.4 All were retrospective and

potentially confounded by treatment choice based on
prognosis, thereby introducing imbalance in prognostic
factors among groups. One study with 207 patients
(including 88 with mitotane) found that adjuvant mitotane
was associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS)50;
however, the mitotane group was likely selected for a higher
risk of recurrence, a bias that cannot be fully adjusted for in
multivariate analysis.
Probably, the best evidence supporting adjuvant mitotane
use comes from a multicentre, case-control study that cir-
cumvented confounders by comparing patient groups treated
at centres adopting two different treatment strategies. The
study involved 177 patients, of whom 47 were followed in
Italian reference centres that systematically adopted adjuvant
mitotane to all radically operated ACC. Fifty-ﬁve Italian pa-
tients and 75 German patients were followed in institutions
not administering adjuvant mitotane therapy.51 The outcome
of this cohort has been recently updated, conﬁrming that the
mitotane-treated patients have prolonged RFS compared with
patients left untreated after surgery.52
Two recent meta-analyses have reported that adjuvant
mitotane treatment reduces the risk of recurrence and
death.4,53 In both analyses, the beneﬁt associated with mito-
tane was signiﬁcant forOS, whereas itwas signiﬁcant forRFS in
only one study.53 Another retrospective multicentre study
demonstrated that blood mitotane concentrations 14 mg/l
were associated with a prolonged RFS in patients treated with
adjuvant mitotane following macroscopically radical surgery.54
On these bases, the recent ESEeENSAT guidelines on the
management of ACC suggest that patients at high risk of
recurrence (stage III, or R1-RX resection, and/or Ki-67 index
>10%) should be offered adjuvant mitotane [IV, B].4 By
contrast, adjuvant therapy has to be discussed on an individual
basis in patients fulﬁlling all the following criteria: stage I or II
disease, histologicallyproven R0 resection and Ki-67expressed
in 10% of neoplastic cells, which deﬁne the category of low
risk of recurrence [V, B] (Figure 1).4 For these patients, the
results of the still ongoing randomised ADIUVO trial55 testing
the efﬁcacy of adjuvant mitotane therapy are awaited.
There are no data regarding the optimal duration of
adjuvant mitotane; however, the authors recommend that
adjuvant mitotane should be administered for at least 2
years [V, B], because the greatest frequency of disease
recurrence is expected within this time frame. However, it is
not advised to continue adjuvant mitotane beyond 5 years,
due to the low number of ACC recurrences occurring after
this time [V, B].4
Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is able to reduce the risk of
local recurrence but does not prevent distant recurrences
and, as a consequence, does not impact OS.4 Therefore, it is
reasonable to associate mitotane with RT in selected pa-
tients with stage III ACC and/or R1 or RX resection, although
the combination carries increased toxicity [IV, B].4
The adjuvant use of cytotoxic drugs is not well established
in ACC. Nevertheless, some centres are beginning to apply
cytotoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin plus etoposide) in selected
patients with very high riskof recurrence and this approach is
being investigated in a randomised trial (NCT03583710).
Special considerations on mitotane. Mitotane is a difﬁcult
drug to manage, with a long half-life, dose-limiting toxicity
and a narrow therapeutic window. Supplementary Table S7,
available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099
summarises the key features of mitotane therapy.
PPGL. AsinACC,thesurgicalexcisionofthetumouristheﬁrst-
line treatment of PPGLs (Figure 2). However, laparoscopic/
minimal invasive surgery is commonly the technique of ﬁrst
choice for resection adrenal and extra-adrenal PPGLs [V, A],
because local invasion is rare and the likelihood of rupture of
the capsule seems less common than in ACC. It is obvious,
however,that the resection should be complete and if there is
any risk that this cannot be achieved by laparoscopic surgery,
an open approach should be carried out. In patients with
PPGL, exposure to high levels of circulating catecholamines
during surgery could cause hypertensive crises and arrhyth-
mias. Therefore, all patients with PPGL should receive pre-
operative preparation at least 10-14 days before surgery [V,
A].5 Blood pressure targets for the treatment are <130/80
mmHg in the supine position, and a systolic blood pressure
preferably >90 mmHg in the upright position. The noncom-
petitive a-adrenoreceptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, is
traditionally the most frequently used adrenergic blocking
agent. A standard starting dose is 10 mg twice daily with ad-
justments over the following days. Alternatively, doxazosin, a
competitive and selective a1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, can
be similarly effective. If the target blood pressure is not
reached, calcium antagonists (slow-release nifedipine) or
metyrosine may be used. Blockade of b-adrenergic receptors
is indicated in patients developing tachyarrhythmias but
should never be started before blockade of a-receptors.
Given the likelihood of rapid intraoperative haemody-
namic lability, continuous monitoring of arterial and central
venous pressures is essential throughout surgery. Although
today’s volatile anaesthetics are not inductive of hyperten-
sive crisis, such crises can be induced by other manipulations
during surgical procedure (e.g. intubation, insufﬂation of
peritoneum, direct palpation of the PPGL) or administration
of certain drugs (e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines).56 Therefore,
it is strongly recommended that anaesthesia is supervised by
an experienced anaesthesiologist alert to the diagnosis of a
catecholamine-producing tumour. Hypertension during sur-
gery may be treated with magnesium sulfate, intravenous a-
adrenoreceptor antagonists (e.g. phentolamine), calcium
antagonists and/or nitroprusside or nitroglycerine. Tachy-
cardia can be treated with intravenous b-adrenergic receptor
blockers (e.g. esmolol). Postoperative hypotension should be
prevented by saline infusion the day before surgery. If this
adverse event occurs, it should be treated aggressively. In
general, sufﬁcient rehydration and treatment of constipation
are important parts of the preoperative management. Post-
operative care should also focus on glucose levels because
hypoglycaemia may occur after reduction of catecholamine
levels. Cytoreductive debulking surgery (R2) in malignant
phaeochromocytoma may improve QoL and survival by
reducing tumour burden and controlling hormonal hyperse-
cretion [V, B].3

Despite a recurrence risk, there is no established indica-
tion of adjuvant treatment in PPGLs. In one series of 171
patients followed up after surgical resection, 29 patients
(17%) had recurrent or new tumours which were malignant
in 15 cases (9%).6
Recommendations
ACC
 Complete en bloc resection of all adrenal tumours sus-
pected to be ACC by a surgeon experienced in adrenal
and oncological surgery is the mainstay of a potentially
curative approach. Open surgery is the standard treat-
ment but in tumours <6 cm without evidence of local
invasion, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is reasonable, if
the surgeon has sufﬁcient experience.
 Additionally,alocoregionallymphadenectomyissuggested.
 Perioperative hydrocortisone replacement is required in
all patients with autonomous cortisol secretion [V, A].
 Adjuvant mitotane is recommended in patients at high
risk of recurrence (stage III, or R1-RX resection, and/or
Ki-67 index >10%) [IV, B].
 Adjuvant therapy has to be discussed on an individual
basis in patients with low risk of recurrence (stage I/II,
R0 resection and Ki-67 index 10%) [V, B].
 Adjuvant RT is only suggested on an individualised basis
(in addition to mitotane) in patients with R1 or RX resec-
tion or in stage III [IV, B].
 After complete resection, radiological imaging every 3
months for 2 years, then every 3-6 months for at least
another 3 years is recommended [V, B].
PPGL
 Most PPGLs can be safely removed laparoscopically by
an experienced surgeon [V, A].
 Preoperatively, patients should be treated for 10-14 days
with an alpha blocker (e.g. phenoxybenzamine) [V, A].
 Meticulous perioperative management of hormonal,
glucose, electrolytes, cardiac and ﬂuid/blood pressure
abnormalities is a critical component of patient care.
 Patients with resected PPGL should be followed at regu-
lar intervals for at least 10 years (lifelong for patients
with a germline mutation). Most authors recommend
only annual measurement of metanephrines in most pa-
tients, but some authors carry out additionally regular
imaging.
MANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE
ACC
Prognosis of advanced ACC patients is limited, the 5-year OS
being <15%. However, several studies have highlighted
considerable heterogeneity in survival. Indeed, prolonged
survival has been reported especially in patients with
resectable oligometastatic disease, with long intervals be-
tween recurrences.57,58
In general, ﬁrst-line therapy in patients with advanced/
metastatic disease is mitotane alone or mitotane plus
chemotherapy (ChT). Surgery and locoregional therapies
should be adopted in addition to systemic therapy in
selected patient populations (Figure 3). The goal of the
therapy is to control tumour growth, hypersecretion-related
symptoms and prolong survival.
A study of the ENSAT network recently identiﬁed the
prognostic factors in patients with advanced disease.
Accordingly the stage, as redeﬁned by a modiﬁed ENSAT
(mENSAT) classiﬁcation,37 which takes into account the
number of tumoural organs, has a major prognostic role
together with the following four parameters grouped under
the label GRAS: (i) tumour Grade, (ii) Resection status of the
primary tumour, (iii) Age, and (iv) tumour-related or
hormone-related Symptoms. Based on these results, a risk
stratiﬁcation was introduced.59 Although this new risk
classiﬁcation looks interesting, it needs conﬁrmation in
other studies before being fully applicable in clinics.
Mitotane
monotherapy.
Mitotane
is
the
only
drug
approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in
locally
advanced
inoperable
and
metastatic
patients
(supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/10.
1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099);
nevertheless,
randomised
controlled prospective trials are lacking. Response rates in
metastatic ACC vary between 13% and 35% but much of
these data are derived from retrospective series, including
studies in 1960s with overall variability in response criteria.4
For details on mitotane management, see above and
supplementary Table S7, available at https://doi.org/10.10
16/j.annonc.2020.08.2099. Owing to the latency of mito-
tane to attain the therapeutic range, mitotane mono-
therapy is indicated in the management of patients with a
low tumour burden and/or more indolent disease (i.e. pa-
tients with favourable prognostic parameters). At disease
progression, ChT with etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin
(EDP) should be added to mitotane monotherapy [I, A].
Cytotoxic ChT. The combination of EDP and mitotane (EDP-M)
is recommended in ﬁrst-line settings based on the FIRM-ACT
trial results [I, A] (supplementary Table S8, available at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099 and Figure 3).
In the phase III randomised trial including 304 patients,
progression-free survival (PFS) was clearly superior in patients
treated with EDP-M compared with patients treated with
streptozocin plusmitotane[5.0versus2.1months,hazardratio
(HR) 0.55, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.43-0.69, P < 0.001].60
However, the difference in OS was not signiﬁcant (14.8 versus
12.0months, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02,P ¼ 0.07), presumably
due to the crossover and presence of mitotane in both arms.
Interestingly, a survival advantage of the EDP-M arm was
observed in patients, who could not receive the second-line
therapy. In patients unsuitable for EDP-M, mitotane in com-
bination with etoposide and cisplatin [V, B],61 or mitotane plus
cisplatin, is an option [V, B].62

In second-line settings, after failure of EDP-M, the treat-
ment options are limited63 and enrolment of patients into
clinical trials should be considered ﬁrst. Most patients with
advanced ACC remain in good clinical condition but urgently
seek therapy. In the absence of trials, possible options are the
association of gemcitabine plus capecitabine64,65 or strepto-
zocin (supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/1
0.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).60 With both treatments, the
median PFS is short, between 2 and 4 months. Mitotane
therapy is sometimes continued in association with second-
line therapies. However, this must be discussed with the
patient according to tolerance to the drug and its effect on
hormonal secretion. The optimal timing to discontinue
mitotane is debated and could be discussed with the patient
individually in cases of progressive disease despite ‘thera-
peutic’ drug levels or highest tolerated doses assessed at two
distinct evaluations.
Surgery and local therapies. Surgery, including surgery of
the primary tumour, may be recommended in all patients
with oligometastatic ACC if a complete resection of all
tumoural lesions is feasible [V, B].4 Additionally, patients
with an indolent disease course or under therapeutic
control might be eligible for surgery. It is also worthwhile
to consider surgery or other local therapies in all patients
in whom systemic therapy led to an objective response
or long-term stable disease [V, B].66,67 A cytoreductive
resection may also be indicated in rare cases of severe
symptomatic hormone excess, after attempts to control
the symptoms with a combination of fast-acting anti-
secretory agents (i.e. metyrapone) and mitotane68 and
local therapies [V, B]. In these patients, postoperative
mitotane is clearly advised [V, A]. Local therapies [e.g. RT,
chemoembolisation,
radiofrequency
ablation
(RFA)]
should also be discussed in all patients with advanced
oligometastatic ACC [V, B].4
In case of a recurrence following ACC surgery, two critical
questions must be addressed: (i) What is the time interval
since the resection? and (ii) Did recurrence occur during
ongoing mitotane therapy (with effective blood levels)? If the
disease-free interval is at least 12 months and another
complete R0 resection/ablation seems feasible, then surgery
or, alternatively, other local therapies are clearly recom-
mended [IV, A].69,70 However, if this time interval is <6
months orifcomplete resection/ablation is not feasible,then,
the EDP-M provides the treatment of choice, especially if the
recurrence occurred during ongoing mitotane treatment at
therapeutic levels [IV, A].
Molecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Several
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been investigated as
second-line approaches in small phase II trials involving
advanced ACC (for review, see4,71). Results, however, have
failed to show signiﬁcant therapeutic efﬁcacy. In addition,
the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor
linsitinib was tested in a multicentre placebo-controlled
phase III trial (GALACTIC trial) and failed to improve
either PFS or OS of advanced ACC patients who had already
received systemic antineoplastic therapies.72
The results of the ﬁrst (small) trials with immune
checkpoint inhibitors in ACC were heterogeneous, with
median PFS times of 1.8, 2.1, 2.6 and 6.75 months,
respectively.73-76 However, in one study with 39 patients,
disease control rate was 52% and median OS reached
almost 25 months, clearly suggesting that a least a subset of
patients beneﬁts from this therapeutic approach.76
Management of hormone excess. In addition to sequelae
of the malignant disease, patients with overt hyper-
cortisolism suffer from immunosuppression, diabetes and
muscle weakness, which can signiﬁcantly impact QoL.
Similarly, severe androgen excess may dramatically impair
well-being in women. Therefore, medical therapy to control
hormonal excess is recommended [V, A]. Mitotane is
frequently able to diminish steroid excess, but its efﬁcacy is
often delayed by several weeks. In these circumstances,
steroidogenic enzyme inhibitors, such as metyrapone or
ketoconazole, can be useful [V, B]. Metyrapone is a well-
tolerated drug and its metabolism and elimination are not
altered by concomitant mitotane. Therefore, it can be safely
administered in association with mitotane and cytotoxic
ChT.68 Local therapies including liver embolisation may also
be discussed. All patients with clinically overt hormone
excess should be managed by physicians experienced with
these endocrine problems.
PPGLs
The therapeutic strategy for metastatic PPGL primarily aims
to control excessive catecholamine secretion and tumour
burden, as there are no curative treatment options. Choices
for treatment include a watch-and-wait policy (including
alpha blocker to control hypertension), locoregional thera-
pies,
radiopharmaceutical
agents,
systemic
ChT
and
molecular-targeted therapies (Figure 4, supplementary
Table S9, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.
2020.08.2099). Such choices should be discussed case by
case in a multidisciplinary specialised setting. In the absence
of any published randomised trials and demonstrated
impact on survival, QoL for patients should always be
considered in any justiﬁcation for a speciﬁc therapeutic
intervention. Indeed, due to the indolent course of disease
in some patients,77 an active surveillance policy may be
indicated for those who are asymptomatic, have a low-to-
intermediate tumour burden and absence of localised
complications of any mass. In these patients, treatment-
related adverse events may exceed any beneﬁt of therapy.
Surgery. Although there is little possibility of a cure for
metastatic PPGLs, surgical resection of the primary tumour
or metastatic lesions should be considered on a case-by-
case basis. Debulking surgery can improve symptoms and
potentially prognosis by reducing secretion of catechol-
amines.78 Other local therapies are available for patients
with metastases, such as RT, RFA or chemoembolisation.
Local measures are also important to prevent bone-related
events.79 However, as with any invasive procedure, local
ablation may induce massive tumoural catecholamine

release, leading to hypertensive complications; thus, the
same medical preparation is required as for surgical in-
terventions (see above).80
Radionuclide therapy. Radionuclide therapy is an effective
treatment and [131I]MIBG is one of the most frequent ap-
proaches with radionuclide doses ranging widely from 5.5
to 38 GBq (150-1000 mCi). Approximately 50% of patients
are eligible for [131I]MIBG therapy based on uptake from
diagnostic scans. Several studies have been published on
the efﬁcacy of [131I]MIBG treatment,3 mostly retrospective
and only two prospective phase II trials.81,82 In both trials,
objective responses were observed in 23% of cases ac-
cording to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours.
Long-term survival of responders of over 6 years has been
reported but progression at study entry was not a prereq-
uisite for most studies. Objective responses were mainly
observed in patients with soft tissue metastases. Grade 3-4
toxicity was reported in 16%-83% of patients, mainly hae-
matological including myelodysplastic syndrome especially
with high activity doses.3,82 [131I]MIBG therapy could be
considered as ﬁrst-line approach in patients displaying avid
uptake of [123I]MIBG in all tumoural lesions who have
unresectable, progressive PPGL or high tumour burden
[III, A].
An alternative approach is a peptide receptor radioligand
therapy using somatostatin analogues labelled with iso-
topes delivering a cytotoxic radionuclide. More than 80% of
PPGLs are detectable by somatostatin-based imaging.83 In
patients with high uptake of PET tracers, such as gallium-68
(68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogues (e.g. [68Ga]DOTA-
TATE or DOTATOC or DOTANOC), treatment with yttrium-
90-labelled [90Y]DOTATOC or lutetium-177-labelled [177Lu]
DOTATATE could be similarly effective as MIBG-based
therapy, although the number of published studies/case
series is limited [V, B].84 Both radionuclide approaches can
be applied repeatedly (with a minimum time interval of 3-4
months). However, toxicity frequently becomes a limiting
factor over time and beneﬁt should be re-evaluated after
every second therapy.
Systemic ChT. Systemic ChT might be considered as a ﬁrst-
line treatment in patients with PPGL who have no signiﬁ-
cant uptake of radiotracers or that are also rapidly pro-
gressing and associated with high tumour burden or are
highly symptomatic [IV, B]. ChT with cyclophosphamide- and
dacarbazine-based regimens combined with vincristine (CVD)
and/or doxorubicin (CVDD or CDD) are the most studied
regimens.85 In the largest published study to date (n ¼ 52
patients), 40% of patients treated with CVD, CDD or CVDD
experienced clinical beneﬁt, including reduction in tumour
size in 25% of cases.86 Based on retrospective data, temozo-
lomide, an oral alternative to dacarbazine, seems to be as
effective as the previous polyChT regimens.87 These studies
suggest that patients with SDHB mutations are especially
sensitive to temozolomide due to the association with
hypermethylation of the promoter for O6-methylguanine-
DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Furthermore, recent case
reports provide limited evidence that metronomic temozo-
lomide is also effective as a second-line therapy.88
Targeted therapies. There is a rationale and some evidence
on the potential efﬁcacy of antiangiogenic drugs in malig-
nant
phaeochromocytomas,
especially
those
bearing
SDHB gene mutations.89 Sunitinib is a potent TKI, including
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 1
and 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)
beta, KIT, FLT3 and RET, and has been the most-studied
targeted therapy in PPGL. In addition to several impres-
sive case reports involving sunitinib, there is one retro-
spective series with 17 patients with progressive metastatic
PPGL.90 Of 14 evaluable patients, three had a partial
response (21%) and ﬁve had stable disease (36%). Median
PFS was 4.1 months and OS 27 months. As hypertension is
a key feature of PPGL and a major adverse event of suni-
tinib, special attention is required to deal with this issue.
There are currently several ongoing trials on sunitinib
including a randomised, placebo-controlled trial testing
sunitinib in patients with malignant PPGL, now closed for
recruitment (FIRST-MAPPP trial, NCT01371201).
A phase II study with pazopanib involving seven patients
(study closed because of poor accrual) reported one
conﬁrmed partial response (17%, duration 2.4 years) and
median PFS and OS of 6.5 and 14.8 months, respectively.91
Recommendations
ACC
 In most patients with metastatic ACC, ﬁrst-line therapy
with mitotane alone or mitotane plus ChT is recommen-
ded; EDP-M is the ﬁrst-line treatment of choice [I, A].
 In selected patients (e.g. low tumour burden and/or
more
indolent
disease),
mitotane
monotherapy
is
reasonable.
 Surgery and locoregional therapies should be adopted in
addition
to
systemic
therapy
in

patient
populations.
 Surgery is the treatment of choice only if all tumoural le-
sions can be removed [V, B].
 Local therapies (e.g. RT, RFA, cryoablation, microwave
ablation, chemoembolisation) are of value for therapy
in advanced ACC, and an individualised treatment
approach is required [V, B].
PPGL
 Although there are no curative treatment options, treat-
ment choices include watch-and-wait, locoregional ther-
apies, radiopharmaceutical agents, systemic ChT and
molecular-targeted therapies.
 In selected patients (e.g. with low tumour burden
without relevant symptoms), a watch-and-wait policy
(including alpha blocker to control hypertension) is
preferred.
 In all patients with metastatic PPGL (debulking) surgery
should be considered.

should be carried out every 3-6 months during the ﬁrst
year (imaging plus metanephrines) and then adjusted
afterward.
FOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND
SURVIVORSHIP
Studies focusing on strategies for surveillance are lacking for
ACC and PPGL. In these guidelines, we follow the recom-
mendations provided recently by other groups.4,9 For locally
advanced or metastatic disease, OS and time-to-progression
are the most important end points, response rate and
treatment toxicity providing secondary end points. Time-to-
progression, ORR and treatment toxicity guide clinical
decision making in individual patients; they should be
evaluated at regular intervals during treatment using CT
scans and/or MRI and laboratory results (supplementary
File, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.
2099). For patients opting for entirely palliative manage-
ment, no systematic imaging is advised. Information on
long-term implications, patient experience, psychological
implications and effect of rehabilitation is lacking for ACC
and PPGL. At least, speciﬁc management of survivors should
be based on individual needs and preferences.
METHODOLOGY
These Clinical Practice Guidelines have been produced by
ESMO in partnership with EURACAN, the European Refer-
ence Network for rare adult solid cancers. These Clinical
Practice Guidelines were developed in accordance with the
ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical Practice
Guidelines development (http://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/
ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology). They are conceived to
provide the standard approach to diagnosis, treatment and
survivorship on ACC and PPGL. Recommended interventions
are intended to correspond to the ‘standard’ approaches,
according to current consensus among the European
multidisciplinary experts in the management of these
extremely rare diseases. These are represented by the
members of the ESMO Faculty and experts belonging to the
Endocrine Tumour domain of EURACAN, the ENSAT and the
European Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions
(Endo-ERN).
Experimental interventions considered to be beneﬁcial
are labelled as ‘investigational’. Other nonstandard ap-
proaches may be proposed to the single patient as ‘options’
for a shared patientephysician decision in conditions of
uncertainty, as long as some supporting evidence (though
not conclusive) is available. Algorithms accompany the text,
covering the main typical presentations of disease, and are
meant to guide the user throughout the text. The relevant
literature has been selected by the expert authors. Levels of
evidence and grades of recommendation have been applied
using the system shown in supplementary Table S10,
available
at
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.
2099.92 Statements without grading were considered justi-
ﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts. This manu-
script has been subjected to an anonymous peer review
process.
