Abstract
This ENETS guidance paper, developed by a multidisciplinary working group, provides
an update on the previous colorectal guidance paper in a different format. Guided by
key clinical questions practical advice on the diagnosis and management of neuroen-
docrine tumours (NET) of the caecum, colon, and rectum is provided. Although cov-
ered in one guidance paper colorectal NET comprises a heterogeneous group of
neoplasms. The most common rectal NET are often small G1 tumours that can be
treated by adequate endoscopic resection techniques. Evidence from prospective
clinical trials on the treatment of metastatic colorectal NET is limited and discussion
of patients in experienced multidisciplinary tumour boards strongly recommended.
Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) and mixed neuroendocrine non‐neuroendocrine
neoplasms (MiNEN) are discussed in a separate guidance paper.

INTRODUCTION - GENERAL
BACKGROUND
The purpose of this guidance paper is to update the previous colorec-
tal guidelines,1 but in a different format by providing expert opinion
on the most important clinical questions. The opinions are supported
by the grade of evidence and the strength of the recommendation.
This paper will cover neuroendocrine tumours (NET) of the caecum,
colon, and rectum.
Though grouped anatomically, in reality this is a heterogeneous
group of neoplasms. Tumours of the caecum are often of intermediate
grade neuroendocrine tumours (NET) and can behave in a similar way
to their ileal counterparts (see question 1). Tumours of the main part
of the colon are often neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) more than
NET G3, and can be mixed neuroendocrine non-neuroendocrine neo-
plasms (MiNEN) with an adenocarcinoma/adenoma component.2 Rec-
tal tumours are commonly small and most often G1, and the main
issue is how these can be resected without recurrence. A NET can
rarely occur within an adenoma at any colorectal site.2,3 Anal canal
neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) are usually NEC and often MiNEN
with a squamous carcinoma component.4 NEC and MINEN are dis-
cussed in a separate guidance paper.5

NEN of the large intestine are classified and staged according to the cur-
rent WHO classification of digestive tumours, 2022 update and 2017

The incidence of colorectal NEN has increased over the last
20 years in all sites, but rectal tumours have increased more than
others which is likely to be related to increased recognition because
of the more frequent use of endoscopy.10–12 The median OS of rectal
NEN is good (>20 years), while for the colon it is poor (approx. 1 year)
and caecum intermediate (about 9 years).10

The main new issues addressed in this
guidance paper
• Whether caecal NET can be treated as per ileal NET (which is the
subject of a separate guidance paper)
• What are the best ways of managing metastatic colonic and rec-
tal NET
• What are the best ways of managing low grade rectal NET, which
has become a common problem for endoscopists and colorectal
surgeons
Table 3 summarises the clinical questions discussed in this paper.
We will try to provide a balanced approach to these issues by
involving representatives from all specialties that manage these
tumours.

MAIN CLINICAL QUESTIONS
2.1
|
Are there differences between NET of the
right colon and ileal NET?
2.1.1
|
Incidence
Background: The incidence of right colon NET is difficult to assess,
since most epidemiological studies have pooled all colon NET, or even
all colorectal NET, in one group. When information about the precise
location is given, right-sided colon NET are constantly more frequent
than left-sided NET, with the caecum as the most frequent site.10,13
In Western countries, the incidence of right colon NET is 0.11 to
0.2/100,000/year, much lower than that of ileal NET, 0.25 to
1.2/100,000/year; the incidence in both sites is much lower in Asian
countries.8,11 As for other NET, there seems to be a trend towards an
increased incidence in colon NET over the last 20 years, but this is
much less obvious than for ileal NET.8 In contrast to ileal NET, there is
no known familial syndrome for colon NET.
Conclusion: Right colon NET are much rarer than ileal NET, even if
they are the most frequent site of colonic NET.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 2a grade B.
2.1.2
|
Histopathology
Background: According to the conventional classification of the
digestive tract, right colon NET are midgut tumours like ileal NET
while left colon NET are hindgut tumours like rectal NET. However,
there are substantial differences between right colon and ileal NET.
In contrast to ileal NET, which are frequently multiple, right colon
NET are usually single; most are large, highly invasive tumours. G3
NET, rare in the ileum, have more often been described in the right
colon. While almost all ileal NET are enterochromaffin (EC),
serotonin-producing tumours, right colon NET are much more

heterogeneous, including EC-cell tumours, L-cell tumours and
others. The genetic landscape of colon NET is poorly known, but
none of the abnormalities described in ileal NET (such as chr18 loss
or CDKN1B mutations) have been reported so far. The so-called
“ileocaecal” tumours are usually large, distal ileal tumours overlap-
ping the ileocaecal valve.
Conclusion: Right colon NET are macroscopically and histologically
different from ileal NET.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 2a grade A.
2.1.3
|
Prognosis
Background: In the SEER publications, caecal NET are documented as a
separate primary tumour localisation, whereas the rest of the large
bowel is divided into colon and rectum. Median overall survival (mOS)
in metastatic NET G1 and G2 small intestinal NET patients, diagnosed
between 2000 and 2012, was 103 months, as compared to 98 months
in caecal NET,10 and in colonic NET only 14 months. Cancer specific
survival of right-sided colonic NET is better than in left-sided NET with
similar mOS.14 In the Spanish Registry publication,15 the mOS for all
jejunal and ileal NET was 12.9 years and all colonic NET 11.9 years
without separation of right and left primary site. In a Canadian publica-
tion, the 5 year OS rate as well as the disease specific survival of colonic
NET (with the majority located in the right colon) did not differ signifi-
cantly from the survival figures for small bowel NET.16
Conclusion: Prognosis of patients with NET of the right colon is
comparable to that of small intestinal NET patients.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 4 grade C.
2.1.4
|
Clinical management
Background: There is a lack of specific treatment data for metastatic
NET of the right colon. Carcinoid syndrome (CS) occurs rarely com-
pared to ileal NET and, if present, antisecretory treatment for symp-
tom control should follow the recommendations for CS as discussed
in a separate guidance paper.17 Although the concept of management
according to embryologic origin (foregut, midgut, hindgut) has largely
been dropped, historically NET of the right colon were treated as
“midgut NET” like small intestinal NET. Patients with NET G1/ G2 of
the right colon were included in therapeutic “midgut “trials such as
the PROMID study18 and the NETTER-1 trial,19 and also in the “mid-
gut subgroup” of the CLARINET trial20 without a reported outcome
for this small subcohort. A subgroup analysis of the RADIANT-2 trial21
supports a possible role for everolimus in patients with NET G1 / G2
of the colon, see below section 2.7.2. NET G3 of the right colon is
rare, the management does not differ from other colorectal NET G3
cases (see 2.7 and Figure 2).
Recommendation: In the absence of specific data for patients with
NET G1 and G2 of the right colon it is justified to treat according to
the algorithm for small intestinal NET G1/ G2.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 4 grade C.
2.2
|
What is the surgical strategy in colonic NET?
Is there room for endoscopic management of
colonic NET?
2.2.1
|
Background
There are no prospective data supporting endoscopic resection of
colonic NET and data here are taken from published case reports,
small retrospective case series and extrapolation of data from larger
databases.
Our prior dogma was that NETs involving the colon are more
aggressive than rectal NET and are felt to present at a later stage
with metastases to regional lymph nodes. With this in mind, surgi-
cal resection with regional lymphadenectomy as in adenocarci-
noma has been considered the mainstay of treatment. However,
trends are now evolving showing that detection of earlier stage
and less aggressive colonic NETs (largely via colonoscopy screen-
ing programmes) may provide evidence to support local excision
for colonic NET.22 This recent study aimed at predicting colonic
NET that may be suitable for local excision by assessing risk of
lymph node metastases. Using the SEER database, 929 patients
with localised NET of the colon diagnosed from 1973 to 2006 were
identified. Firstly, the diagnosis of tumours involving regional
lymph nodes decreased from 71% to 46% during the period of this
study. Intramucosal tumours <1 cm had a 4% rate of lymph node
metastasis, while all other subgroups had rates ≥14%. Hence, local
or endoscopic resection of colon NET <1 cm in size and confined
to
the
mucosa
without
formal
lymphadenectomy
may
be
appropriate.22
In a large US National Cancer Database analysis of 7967 colonic
and 11,929 rectal NET between 2004 and 2014 who underwent
resection, 525 (6.6%), colon NET were treated using local excision
(vs. 89.1% of local excision for rectal NET).23 They found that endo-
scopic excision for colonic NET is increasing over time as stage and
tumour size are reducing.
Similarly, a Dutch study found that local excisions increased both
for rectal (87% in 2006 vs. 95% in 2016) and colonic NET (7% in 2006
vs. 52% in 2016).12
Several authors have described successful endoscopic excision of
colonic NET, and in the main use of endoscopic resection techniques
are reserved for smaller lesions (often <10 mm).24–26
Techniques
such
as
en
bloc
endoscopic
submucosal
dis-
section (ESD) resections or using devices to achieve full thickness re-
section
have
also
been
described,
but
only
limited
data
are
available.27,28
Recommendation: Endoscopic resection may be appropriate in
selected cases for small (usually 10 mm of less) colonic NET G1. Since
there are little useful data on follow-up, discussion at a dedicated mul-
tidisciplinary team (MDT) post resection is warranted to decide on
follow-up or further resection on a case-by-case basis.
In all other cases as well as after incomplete endoscopic re-
section (R1), surgical resection is recommended.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 4 grade C.

2.3
|
When is imaging in rectal NET (in addition to
endoscopic ultrasound) indicated and which kind of
imaging at the initial diagnosis?
2.3.1
|
Background
The need for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in locoregional stag-
ing of rectal NET (rNET) is related to the risk of metastatic disease
after endoscopic resection. The technical aspects of local preparation
and sequences for rectal MRI should follow the recommendations of
those for rectal adenocarcinoma.
There is general agreement between studies to consider tumour
size ≥10 mm as the major parameter to determine the risk for meta-
static disease in rNET.22,29–33 An analysis of the national cancer data-
base (NCDB) cohort of 17,448 rNET identified an incidence of lymph
node metastasis of 2.5% for tumours ≤10 mm versus 12.8% for
tumours 11–20 mm.34 Another study evaluating 788 patients from
the SEER database with T1 rNET reported an incidence of lymph node
metastases of 1.1% for tumours ≤10 mm versus 6.6% in tumours 11–
20 mm.33
In another study with 132 rectal NET ≤10 mm, the mean rate of
lymph node metastases was 3% ranging from 0% in tumours ≤6 mm
to 10.3% in tumours 7–10 mm.30 Similarly, Soga et al. showed a rate
of metastases of 24/247 (9.7%) for 6–10 mm tumour size and 2/153
(1.3%) for <5 mm tumours.
Other risk factors for metastatic disease such as the presence
of lymphovascular invasion, the presence of muscular invasion,
histological non-L cell-type and a high tumour grade have
also been reported in different studies.9,29,31,35,36 Correlation
between tumour size and lymphovascular invasion has also been
demonstrated with a tumour size ≥5 mm at higher risk of lympho-
vascular involvement than in tumours with a size <5 mm,36 and
predictive scores taking into account both, the tumour size and
the lymphovascular involvement have been shown to provide an
accurate assessment of the risk of metastatic lymph node
involvement.37,38
Computed tomography (CT) has limited value for the detection
and characterisation of regional metastatic lymph nodes in patients
with rNET.39 Similarly to rectal adenocarcinoma, MRI with diffusion-
weighted imaging (DWI) is considered as the most sensitive imaging
method for regional lymph node detection, detection of residual dis-
ease after incomplete resection, and the involvement of pelvic struc-
tures in more advanced tumours.40
Recommendation:
Baseline locoregional staging by pelvic MRI should be recom-
mended in patients with
• rNET with a tumour size ≥10 mm
• All G2-G3 rNET
• rNET with suspected involvement of lymph nodes on EUS
If the rNET has been already resected (in addition to previous
recommendation)
• rNET with incomplete resection (in R1 without risk factors only if a
second endoscopic resection with the result of R0 is not done)
• rNET with a tumour size of 5–10 mm and lymphovascular involve-
ment or invasion of the muscularis propria.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 4 grade C.
Concerning distant metastases, the liver is the most common meta-
static site (58%) followed by bone (9.4%), mesentery, peritoneum (8.4%)
and lung (8%).35 As for metastatic lymph nodes, the tumour size is the
major parameter for the risk of developing distant non-nodal metastases.
Data from a large American cohort of 3880 patients from the National
Cancer Database (NCDB) showed that the optimal cut-off of tumour size
for the presence of distant metastases was 11.5 mm with an incidence
of distant metastases reported at 13.8% in tumours ≥11.5 mm.41
Similar to other digestive NEN, abdominopelvic CT and 68Ga-
SSR-PET/CT (111In-DTPA scintigraphy if PET/CT not available) are
the imaging modalities of choice for distant metastases staging.
Due to the superiority of MRI over CT and 68Ga-SSR-PET/CT for
liver metastasis detection, liver MRI including DWI is recom-
mended in cases of liver metastases depicted or suspected on CT
and/or SRI. Injection of a hepatospecific contrast agent at MRI is
preferred to extracellular contrast agent for liver metastases detec-
tion and characterisation, particularly if liver surgery is being
discussed.42
The role of PET-CT is mainly to assess the presence of metastatic
spread or to assess eligibility/usefulness of subsequent treatment
lines in metastatic disease. Most well-to-moderately differentiated
NET retain high expression of somatostatin receptors (SST) and there-
fore they can be studied by 68Ga-SSR-PET/CT ([68Ga]Ga-DOTATOC-,
[68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE-,
[68Ga]Ga-DOTANOC-
PET/CT)
for
both
primary (if dimensionally feasible) and metastatic sites detection
(especially at liver and nodal level). 68Ga-SSR-PET/CT is a fundamen-
tal pre-requisite to assess eligibility for peptide receptor radionuclide
therapy (PRRT) in advanced inoperable tumours showing significant
SST expression. EANM guidelines43 also recommend the use of [18F]
FDG PET/CT (18F-FDG PET/CT) to assess glucose metabolic activity,
often increased in these tumours. FDG-derived data may help guide
choices of chemotherapy as well as to provide prognostic data.
However, since FDG use in NEN is not standardised and grade strongly
influences the pretest probability of FDG-positivity, even in the setting
of rectal NET, 18F-FDG PET/CT is generally considered in cases of met-
astatic higher-grade G2 (>10%), or NET G3. For PET-CT it is important
to take its limitations into account (in particular, spatial resolution of
approximately 5 mm; potential false positivity at sites of infection/
inflammation), so appropriate timing after surgery should be adopted.
Recommendation: Distant metastases staging with chest CT and
abdominal
CT/MRI
and
68Ga-SSR-PET/CT
is
recommended
in
patients with
• Tumour size ≥10 mm
• Any grade 2–3 rNET
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 4 grade C.

2.4
|
Which endoscopic/surgical techniques are
appropriate to treat rectal NETs (including indication
for oncological resection)?
2.4.1
|
Background
Risk factors for more malignant behaviour/metastases are size
(as above) but also endoscopic features (depression or ulceration),
imaging features (suspicious lymph nodes on EUS or MRI) and patho-
logical features (grade >1 and or lymphangioinvasion).44,45 Comparing
515 G1 and 86 G2 rNET, the incidence of lymph nodes and distant
metastases was 5.2% and 2.1% in G1 NETs compared to 44.2 and
31.4% in G2 tumours, respectively.46
As mentioned above risk for lymph node or distant metastases is
very low after endoscopic removal of T1/G1-NET <10 mm.33,47 How-
ever, there is no definite lower limit of size that excludes lymph node
spread.48
Techniques that are used to remove rectal NETs:
1. Simple polypectomy
2. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (lift and snare, with or with-
out diathermy) piecemeal or in one specimen49
3. Cap-EMR50
4. Underwater EMR51
5. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)
6. Transanal minimallly invasive surgery (TAMIS) or transanal endo-
scopic microsurgery (TEMS).
7. Endoscopic full thickness resection (eFTR) with specific device or
“over the scope clip” (OTSC) and snare
8. Low anterior resection (LAR) with total mesorectal excision (TME)
9. Abdominoperineal resection (APR) with TME
There are thus many different ways of removing a rectal NET. A
common scenario is that the rectal NET is removed using a snare poly-
pectomy with or without prior lifting. This is commonly performed if
the lesion is not recognised as a rectal NET and assumed to be a more
common type of polyp. This often results in an R1 resection of the
rectal NET. For management of R1 resection, see question below.
Ideally, the lesion in the rectum would be recognised as a NET by
its yellow/orange colour and sometimes by the typical appearance of
a doughnut-shaped lesion. The doughnut appearance commonly
occurs when the lesion reaches 1 cm. Below the size of 1 cm an expe-
rienced endoscopist will be able to determine whether it is likely that
an R0 resection can be achieved, and then it is reasonable to use at
least a lifting or a cap technique to remove the lesion.52
A meta-analysis showed that ESD was successful for rectal NEN
with a complete resection rate of 89%, 4% adverse events and <1%
local recurrence. The complete resection rate was better for ESD than
for conventional EMR (89 vs. 75%, p < .001). However, modified-EMR
(with band ligation, double channel, cap assisted, circumferential pre-
cutting) showed complete resection in 91% of patients.53 Two meta-
analyses showed modified EMR superior to c-EMR and ESD (95%
vs. 84%, p = .03) with no differences in adverse events and recur-
rence rates.31,54 Recent small studies reported a 100% R0 rate after
endoscopic full thickness resection (eFTR) without major adverse
events and short intervention times.55,56
Patients with rectal NET >20 mm or evidence of lymph node metas-
tases are treated, depending on the level of the rectal NET, with either a
low anterior resection (LAR) or abdominoperineal resection (APR) com-
bined with a total mesorectal excision (TME). The most important com-
plication of a LAR with TME is anastomotic leakage. Some evidence
suggests only a small number of patients have mesorectal metastases;
only 3/8 patients undergoing LAR and synchronous TME for rectal NET
had lymph node metastases in the mesorectum.57 As mentioned above,
for lesions >2 cm, the likelihood of LN and distant metastasis is higher
and full imaging is always required. TAMIS can be performed if patients
have comorbidities precluding more major resection.58
For lesions 1–2 cm endoscopic resection can be undertaken, but
it is important to achieve R0 resection. If there is contact with the
muscularis propria, some of the rectal muscle needs to be dissected
out. This has been done endoscopically (either full or partial muscle
resection with intermuscular dissection between the circular and lon-
gitudinal muscle) or with transanal surgery with full or partial thick-
ness muscle resection. If lymph nodes are seen to be involved, clearly
an oncological surgical resection is required.
Recurrence rates for LAR combined with TME for larger rectal
NET or rectal NET with more malignant behaviour are based on case
reports. Most recurrences are described in the lateral pelvic compart-
ment or as liver metastases.39,59

Recommendations (also see algorithm)
• For lesions 10 mm or less endoscopic (mEMR, ESD, eFTR) re-
section is recommended and recurrence rates are low.
• For lesions 20 mm or more, surgical resection using LAR or APR is
recommended (after exclusion of unresectable distant metastases).
• For lesions 10-20 mm full imaging will lead to MDT discussion
about either endoscopic or surgical therapy.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 3 grade C.

Is there need for a second resection in
patients with R1-resected rectal NET?
2.5.1

Background
As mentioned above, it is common to have an R1 resection of a rectal
polyp, usually since it is not recognised this was a NET prior to poly-
pectomy. This is a common reason for referral to a NET unit when the
polyp has been resected elsewhere.
Pathology issues: R1/2 resection is defined when a biopsy/tissue
sample shows that the NET reaches the limits of the sample itself
(even a free margin <1 mm is defined as R0), that is, the endoscopist
did not succeed in a complete removal of the “polyp” or the

endoscopist on purpose took a small sample of a large lesion in order
to assess its nature. In the case of mucosectomy of a known NET
lesion, especially when sessile, special care should be applied. It is
common safety practice to align the fresh sample on cardboard to
reduce fixation shrinking artefacts. In most cases this allows a proper
handling of margins by pathologists and a correct R assessment. In
some cases, however, this may still be difficult/impossible. The pathol-
ogist is recommended to report this issue clearly so that a discussion
of the case may be decided before any further action.
In the presence of an R1 resection, if the original tumour was
>2 cm, an oncological resection is indicated after appropriate imaging
had excluded unresectable distant metastases (see above).
If the tumour was 1–2 cm and an R1 resection is documented
there is a risk of recurrence at the site and in the pelvic LN. In addition
to imaging (see above) careful examination of the resection site is
needed which is usually visible quite easily due to the scarring that
occurs after resection of a lesion this size. Biopsies should be taken
from the site of resection and rectal EUS should determine if there is
any abnormal tissue deep to the resection. Normally, a resection of this
scarred area should be undertaken either by an expert endoscopist
resecting the mucosa and submucosa down to the muscle layer, or by
of full-thickness resection endoscopically or by transanal surgery. It is
important for a lesion of this size that it is resected en bloc (see above)
so that the pathologist can definitively say that there is now an R0 re-
section at the end of this second procedure. In patients unfit for endo-
scopic or surgical resection, a watch-and-wait policy might be adopted
after discussion with the patient, but it would have to be explained that
the recurrence rate is unknown but probably not zero.
For lesions of less than 1 cm the usual situation is that the snare
resects the tumour at or very close to the edge of the tumour and this
is technically an R1 resection by oncological standards. This does not
necessarily mean that there is tumour tissue remaining at the re-
section site. Normally, these patients would have a close inspection of
the resection site together with biopsies and an endoscopic ultra-
sound of the area if possible. The safest approach is to perform fur-
ther endoscopic
or
TAMIS
resection
to
prevent any
possible
recurrence. It is unclear whether re-resection of R1 resected small
rectal NET affects long term outcome.49 Some units would recom-
mend a watch-and-wait policy but there is a small risk of recurrence
and the patient will need long term follow-up. There are large series
from South Korea60,61 where this disease is very common, and it
seems clear that up to 2 years the recurrence rate is close to 0. This
does not necessarily mean that the recurrence rate is 0 for ever and if
watch and wait is adopted we recommend flexible sigmoidoscopy at
FIGURE 1
Diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for patients with rectal neuroendocrine tumours (NET). 1Imaging usually includes endoscopic
ultrasound and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for local staging and distant metastases staging with chest and abdominal computed
tomography (CT)/MRI and 68Gallium SSA-PET-CT. 2In patients with R1 pathology after inappropriate endoscopic resection (e.g., force biopsy or
snare resection) a second endoscopic resection with appropriate technique (mEMR, ESD, eFTR) can be undertaken without imaging and if the
result is R0 and G1 L0 V0 no further investigations necessary. 3Oncological surgical resection means either a low anterior resection (LAR) or
abdominoperineal resection (APR) combined with a total mesorectal excision (TME) depending on the localisation in the rectum. 4Follow-up
investigations include conventional imaging, functioning imaging and endoscopic re-evaluation. For details please see text recommendation 2.8.1.
5In cases with more than one risk factor even with normal imaging a careful discussion with the patient is necessary to decide on follow-up or
oncological resection; risk factors are: size >1 cm, G > 1; L1; V1. eFTR, endoscopic full thickness resection; ESD, endoscopic submucosal
dissection; FU, follow-up; mEMR, modified endoscopic mucosal resection (for example cap EMR); TAMIS, transanal minimallly invasive surgery.

intervals after an R1 resection of these small lesions. In practice, if
these tumours recur, it is usually at the same site and they continue to
be very slow growing so a full thickness resection can be considered
on recurrence. As far as we are aware, the incidence of lymph node
and distant metastases from these recurrences is extremely low.

Recommendations (post R1 resection)
• >2 cm or adverse features (higher G2 / G3; L1; V1): oncological re-
section after exclusion of distant metastases
• 1–2 cm full imaging and endoscopic work up. Repeat endoscopic
resection if appropriate (full thickness)
• <1 cm. Ideally: Second endoscopic resection or TAMIS to achieve
R0, alternatively: if negative EUS, MRI and repeat biopsy: watch
and wait after discussion with patient.

Is there a role for surgery in metastatic
rectal NET?
2.6.1
|
Background
It is common for larger rectal NET (>2 cm) to have distant metastases,
particularly to the liver and bone.
Resection of the primary in the presence of distant metastases
will depend on whether there are local symptoms (bleeding, obstruc-
tion) and whether any resection of metastases might be possible.
Many factors will be involved in this discussion with the patient. In
patients with asymptomatic primary and unresectable metastases
tumour control by systemic treatment has priority.
2.6.2

Recommendation
Primary resection in the presence of unresectable metastases will
depend on the presence of local symptoms such as pain and bleeding.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 5 grade D.

Which systemic treatments should be
selected in patients with metastatic colonic and

Role of somatostatin analogues (SSA) for
tumour control?
Background: Octreotide LAR and lanreotide autogel are well-established
antiproliferative first-line treatments in patients with receptor positive GEP-
NET and a proliferation rate Ki-67 not exceeding 10% based on the results
of two placebo-controlled phase III trials.18,20 Whereas patients with NET
of the right-side of the colon (belonging to the midgut) were included in
both trials without information on results of this subgroup, patients with
hindgut NET were only included in the CLARINET trial. This subgroup com-
prised 14 patients (11 lanreotide arm, 3 placebo arm) and with a HR of 1.47
with broad confidence interval a benefit could not be demonstrated.20
Recommendation: SSA are indicated as first-line treatment of meta-
static receptor positive NETs of the right colon. Considering the limited
treatment options for these patients and the favourable side effect pro-
file of SSA, SSA may also be used in NET of colorectal origin belonging to
the hindgut if the tumour lesions are SST positive and slowly growing.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation for patients with caecal
NET and NET of the right sided colon: Level 2a grade A.
Level of evidence/ grade of recommendation for left sided colon and
rectum: Level 2b grade B.

Is there a role for everolimus?
Background: Two large placebo-controlled studies for evaluation of the
efficacy of everolimus with antiproliferative intention included patients
with colorectal NET: The RADIANT-2 and the RADIANT-4 trial. A sub-
group analysis of RADIANT-2 in patients with colorectal NET (N = 39,
representing 9% of the study population) demonstrated a significant pro-
longation of mPFS by adding everolimus to octreotide LAR compared to
placebo plus octreotide LAR (29.9 months vs. 6.6 months; HR 0.34,
p = .011), despite objective responses not being documented.21 For the
28 patients with colonic NET treated within this study on patients with a
history of CS, a mPFS of 29.9 months was documented in the treatment
arm with everolimus and 13 months without (HR 0.39; p = .056). The
RADIANT-4 trial of non-functioning NET included 40 patients with rectal
NET, eight colonic NET and five caecal NET (18% of the study popula-
tion). The subgroup publication of gastrointestinal NET62 reported clear
efficacy for the rectal NET subcohort with a prolongation of PFS from
1.9 months with placebo to mPFS of 7.4 months with everolimus. The
results of the patients with colonic NET were not reported separately.
Taking the results for all gastrointestinal NETs together a prolongation of
mPFS from 5.4 months (placebo) to 13.1 months (everolimus) was docu-
mented (HR 0.56). The majority of patients received prior treatments
before inclusion in the RADIANT 2 or 4 trials.
Recommendation: Everolimus is indicated for tumour control in
patients with metastatic colorectal NET progressing after prior
treatment(s). In selected patients, for example with SST negative
tumours, it may also be used as first-line systemic treatment.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation for everolimus in colo-
rectal NET: Level 1b (2 randomised controlled trials available with a
cohort of colorectal NET representing 9% and 18% of the entire study
cohort, respectively), grade B.

trials with TKIs (sunitinib, pazopanib, cabozantinib, lenvatinib, surufatinib
and axitinib)63–68 included some colorectal patients without reporting
efficacy details for this subgroup. The phase II/III AXINET trial for
patients with progressive extrapancreatic NET included four colonic
and 16 rectal NET patients (8% of the study population) but specific
data for this subgroup are not available. Using centralised reporting
mPFS with axitinib + octreotide LAR was prolonged to 16.6 months
compared with 9.9 months with placebo + octreotide-LAR. The Chi-
nese SANETep trial is a randomised placebo-controlled phase III trial
of surufatinib in patients with extrapancreatic NET. The trial
included four colonic (2%) and 53 rectal (26.8%) NET patients. Effi-
cacy for the entire study population was demonstrated with an ORR
of 10% in surufatinib-treated patients (vs. 0% in the control arm),
and a mPFS of 3.8 months in the placebo group versus 9.2 months
in the surufatinib group (HR 0.33; p < .0001).69 A phase III trial of
cabozantinib is running in the USA (NCT03375320).
Recommendation: TKI may be used in patients with colorectal
NET after failure of better-established treatment options (evero-
limus, PRRT, locoregional treatments), ideally within a clinical
trial. More data are needed to define the role of TKIs in
colorectal NET.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation for TKIs in colorectal
NET: Level 2b (low quality randomised trials available including a small
subcohort of colorectal NET), grade B.

Role of chemotherapy
Background: Chemotherapy plays a minor role in the treatment of
well-differentiated NET of non-pancreatic origin but has not been
specifically assessed in colorectal NET. Only the first randomised
trial (EST 3272) ever conducted in metastatic “carcinoid” tumours
specifically reported results for the small subgroup of colorectal NET
(7 patients [6%]).70 This trial randomised 118 patients to receive
streptozotocin (STZ) with cyclophosphamide (CTX) versus STZ with
5-fluorouracil (5-FU). No significant differences were observed in
response rate (RR) (33% vs. 26%) or survival (12.5 m vs. 11.2 m)
among study arms. Global RR for colorectal NET was 29%, 20% for
colon (N = 5) and 50% for rectal primaries (N = 2). Other random-
ised trials included ≤10% of colorectal primaries71 or no colorectal
primaries at all,72 and none reported subgroup analysis for colorectal
NET. More recent non-controlled phase 2 trials have not included
colorectal NET or have not specified the GI primary tumour site of
patients included.73 One of the few exceptions is the BETTER trial
that explored capecitabine and bevacizumab in 49 patients with
advanced GI NET (40 small bowel, 7 colorectal, 2 other primaries).74
This trial reported an objective response rate per RECIST of 18%
(12% per central review), a median PFS of 23.4 months, and a 2-year
OS rate of 85%. Some retrospective series suggest FOLFOX may
also be an active regimen in digestive NET (RR 17% in rectal
NET).75,76 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials
and 7 retrospective series, that included 264 patients with non-
pancreatic GI NET (median of 11 patients/study), reported an overall
RR of 11.5% (range: 5.8%–17.2%).77 No solid data are available,
however, on chemotherapy efficacy by tumour proliferative index,
which is likely to have a relevant impact on response rates, particu-
larly of cell cycle phase-specific cytotoxic agents.
In summary, the quality of evidence regarding assessment of che-
motherapy efficacy in colorectal NET is poor. Site-specific clinical tri-
als and exploratory descriptive analysis of trial outcomes per site and
proliferative index are highly encouraged.
Recommendation: Chemotherapy efficacy data are very limited in
colorectal NET and its use is, therefore, not recommended on a rou-
tine basis. Chemotherapy may be considered in selected individuals
with rapidly progressive advanced colorectal NET upon failure of
other better assessed therapeutic options. Fluoropyrimidine-based
regimens, generally combined with temozolomide or oxaliplatin, are
the preferred treatment options when chemotherapy is judged to be
indicated in selected patients with colorectal NET.
Level of evidence/ grade of recommendation for chemotherapy in
colorectal NETs: Level 2b (low quality randomised trials available for
extrapancreatic NET including a small subcohort of colorectal NET),
grade C.

PRRT for colorectal NET
Background: Metastatic rectal NET are generally associated with a
poorer prognosis and treatment options are not standardised. [177Lu]
Lu-DOTA-TATE PRRT is now approved for the treatment of unresect-
able or metastatic, progressive, well-differentiated (G1 and G2), SST-
positive GEP NET in adults in Europe and the United States. Overall,
published data support a significant improvement in progression-free
survival and quality of life of PRRT-treated midgut NET patients
(including 4 colonic NET patients). In addition, a non-significant trend
to better overall survival compared to high dose SSA was documen-
ted.78 PRRT may be considered in advanced metastatic rectal NET
patients showing SSA PET-CT-positivity. Published evidence of the
efficacy and feasibility of PRRT in rectal NEN is scarce, mostly consist-
ing of case reports or small series included in larger cohorts including
NET of other primary tumour sites.79–83
In 2019, a retrospective study specifically addressing results of
PRRT in patients with advanced rectal NET was published84: 27 rectal
NEN patients (G2 = 19, G3 = 3, G1 = 1; unknown grade in 4 cases)
were treated with PRRT (26 for disease progression, 1 for uncon-
trolled symptom). PRRT was well tolerated, showing minimal toxicity
(no grade 3 or 4 toxicity was reported) and promising results, both in
terms of objective response (overall disease control rate was 96%:
70% had RECIST 1.1 partial response, 26% had stable disease) and
symptom control (overall 59% reported partial improvement of symp-
toms: mostly reduction of pain, improvement in weight, prior bowel
symptoms). Finally, the study showed that re-treatment with PRRT is
also feasible provided that SST-expression is maintained. Overall, fur-
ther data are needed to fully assess the benefits of PRRT in rectal
NEN in the paradigm of other treatment options, although preliminary
published results are encouraging.

Neoadjuvant treatment
Data on neoadjuvant treatment of NEN patients with colorectal
NET, mainly with chemotherapy, PRRT and chemoradiotherapy in
the case of rectal primary, are sparse.85 These data derive from
retrospective studies of limited numbers of patients or case
reports. It is reasonable to consider neoadjuvant/downstaging
therapies in selected patients with locally advanced or oligometa-
static disease, no comorbidities and good performance status, but
prospective studies are necessary to clarify their role in this clini-
cal setting. In those rare cases with potential application of a
neoadjuvant approach it is strongly advisable to be cautious and
discuss it after careful evaluation of all the parameters in a multi-
disciplinary setting.
Recommendation: Neoadjuvant therapy could be considered in
carefully selected patients although further data is needed.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 4 grade D.

What is the recommended follow-up in rectal
or colonic NET?
2.8.1
|
Rectal NET—Background
Following local endoscopic excision of rectal NET, clear distinction
needs to be made following resection that is pathologically R0, inde-
terminate or R1. As per above, every attempt should be made to ren-
der indeterminate or R1 resected lesions R0 and this will thus allow
for follow- up decisions based on R0 resection category.
The rate of recurrence following local/endoscopic excision of rec-
tal NET varies and is dependent on factors such as size and tumour
biology, as above.
Analysis of follow-up is difficult due to the retrospective nature
of data and grouping of patients with and without additional therapies
following initial endoscopic resections (e.g., salvage local excisions
either endoscopic or surgical). A recent systematic review and meta-
analysis of prognostic importance of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) in
small (<20 mm) rectal NET including 15 studies with a total of 1213
patients, provided sufficient data to evaluate the prognostic impact of
LVI on disease recurrence.36 In total, 1022/1213 (84.2%) cases were
followed up. The groups of patients were very heterogenous. Two
cases of recurrence were found in follow up: 109 patients in three
studies had no further resection, even though, LVI was identified at
endoscopic resection. None of these 109 recurred during the follow-

Asymptomatic or symptomatic in this algorithm does not refer to carcinoid syndrome or other hormonal symptoms but to general tumour-related
symptoms such as pain, weight loss, and inappetence. Patients with carcinoid syndrome should always be treated with SSA. As evidence for
several situations is limited discussion of the individual situation of a patient with metastatic colorectal NET in an experienced MDT is mandatory.

up period (30–76 months). A total of 31 patients had additional radical
surgery after endoscopic resection, of which positive lymph nodes
were found in 21.7% (5/23).36
Another meta-analysis comparing resection techniques (EMR with
suction vs. ESD) for small rectal NET found overall recurrence rates to
be low (<1%) with one local recurrence and one case with metastasis to
the liver (duration of follow-up was short).54 Another meta-analysis
comparing ESD to EMR techniques for endoscopic resection did not
find any difference with respect to risk of recurrence.86
Specific information for method of imaging, best intervals, and
duration of follow-up after R0 resection of rNET with risk factors (size
>10 mm, G2/G3, microangioinvasion) are not available.
Recommendations:
• After R0 resection of a rectal NET G1 L0 V0 ≤10 mm a follow-up
is not necessary.
• After R0 resection of a rectal NET G1 L1 or V1 or G2/G3 ≤10 mm
6 monthly abdominopelvic MRI and yearly sigmoidoscopy for at
least 5 years is recommended. In addition, 68Ga-SSR-PET/CT is
recommended initially and after 12 months.
• After R1 resection of a rectal NET G1/ low G2 ≤10 mm (without
second endoscopic resection to reach R0) endoscopy and EUS or
MRI 12 monthly for at least 5 years is recommended.
• After R0 resection of a rectal NET G1/G2 > 10 mm 6 monthly MRI
and yearly sigmoidoscopy for at least 5 years is recommended. In addi-
tion, 68Ga-SSR-PET/CT is recommended initially and after 12 months.
• After R0 resection of a rectal NET G3 3 monthly MRI for 2 years fol-
lowed by 6 monthly MRI for 5 years and 6 monthly sigmoidoscopy
for 2 years, followed by yearly endoscopic investigations for 5 years
is recommended. In addition, 68Ga-SSR-PET/CT is recommended ini-
tially and after 12 months. 18F-FDG PET/CT may be considered.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 5 grade C.
2.8.2

Colonic NET-background
Due to the rarity of colonic NET no specific information for follow-up from
published data are available. Tumour specific follow-up is mainly based on
the estimated risk of recurrence and clinical symptoms. In the low risk
group of pT1 pN0 R0 G1, follow-up may be limited to yearly abdominal
MRI for 5 years and a follow-up colonoscopy after 12 to 24 months, but
for the majority of patients life-long follow-up is recommended according
to the ENETS standards of care (SOC).87 Curative resected stage III and IV
patients harbour a relevant risk of recurrence and imaging is indicated
6 monthly long term. If initially receptor positive, 68Ga-SSR-PET/CT is
recommended every 24 months according to the SOC publication.87 In
NET G3 cases a shorter follow-up interval of 3 months may be appropriate
and additional 18F-FDG PET/CT can be considered.
Recommendations:
• After complete resection of a NET G1/G2 without lymph node
involvement abdominal MRI or CT in yearly intervals for at least
5 years is recommended.
• In patients with complete resected colonic NET G1/G2 and initial
stage III or IV imaging with thoracoabdominal CT or abdominal
MRI and chest CT is recommended 6 monthly. In addition, 68Ga-
SSR-PET/CT
every
24 months
is
recommended
if
initially
positive.
• In patients after complete resection of a colonic NET G3, initial
imaging intervals of 3 months are recommended.
• Colonoscopy is recommended in all complete resected patients
after 12 months or if symptoms occur.
Level of evidence/grade of recommendation: Level 5 grade C.

UNMET NEEDS AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
As illustrated by the low levels of evidence for the recommendations
in our guidance paper, colorectal NET is an under-researched area.
The most frequent colorectal NET are the small rectal NET which
in the vast majority harbour a low malignant potential. Risk factors for
lymph node and distant metastases have been identified. The best
technique to treat these patients as well as the need for follow-up is
unclear. Long term follow-up data (at least 5 years) for R1 resected
small tumours without risk factors are needed to establish whether
late recurrence occurs. In patients with R0 resection and risk factors
there are no standardised follow-up protocols available. For localised
rectal NET we therefore suggest:
• Randomised clinical trial comparing the outcome of modified EMR
techniques with endoscopic full thickness resection
• Prospective data collection of R1 resected rectal NET patients if a
second endoscopic intervention is not performed to establish the
risk of late recurrence
• Follow-up protocols need to be researched.
In patients diagnosed with metastatic disease the best therapeu-
tic approach or sequence of treatments is largely unknown. Although
tumour characterisation has improved and it has been identified that
ileal NET, colonic NET and rectal NET are different entities, they are
mixed together in study protocols as “extrapancreatic NET” often
without outcome data being reported for the subgroups. Further clini-
cal trials should include colon NET and rectal NET as individual
cohorts.
There is still a lack of predictive markers that could be used for
treatment decisions. First retrospective data report high response
rates to PRRT in metastatic well-differentiated rectal NET (see
above).84 At the time of writing two international studies (NCT
03972488 and NCT 04919226) will analyse the efficacy of first line
PRRT in NET G2 / G3. Hopefully, reports will include information on
the subcohort of rectal NET patients.
With the WHO classification 2019, the subgroup of NET G3 has
been introduced also for gastrointestinal NET.6 Most available data
for NET G3 focus on pancreatic NET G3 and the best treatment
approach for colorectal NET G3 is unclear.

For metastatic colorectal NET we suggest:
• An international effort to run a trial for metastatic rectal NET
(e.g., to compare CAPTEM chemotherapy with PRRT in NET G2
with Ki-67 >10% as first-line treatment)
• Inclusion of metastatic colonic and metastatic rectal NET patients
in trials evaluating new treatment options with separate reports for
these subgroups
• More research to establish predictive markers.
