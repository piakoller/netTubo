MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data regarding the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of carcinoid
syndrome (CS) and carcinoid heart disease (CHD) were identified by
searches of the MEDLINE database using specific terms in human
studies: CS; CHD; screening; epidemiology; diagnosis; treatment;
prognosis. The search results were supplemented by manual searching
of relevant journals, reference lists in key articles and other appropri-
ate documents, and expert opinion. All recommendations are offered
on the basis of the best available evidence, supplemented by the
authors' experiences in managing CS and CHD. Each recommendation
for treatment will have a level of evidence and grade of recommenda-
tion as per the GRADE system (adapted in Infectious Disease society
This first ENETS guidance paper on CS aims to provide practical guidance for NEN specialists
in the diagnosis and management of CS, with special emphasis on CHD.

A. INTRODUCTION: GENERAL
BACKGROUND
2.1
|
a. Definition
Carcinoid syndrome (CS) is the most frequent hormonal complication
accompanying neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) and is defined by
chronic diarrhoea and/or flushing in the presence of systemic elevated
levels of serotonin or its metabolite 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA).
Importantly, other causes of these symptoms should be considered
and investigated depending on the clinical presentation. CS is predom-
inantly encountered in patients with well-differentiated NENs (neuro-
endocrine tumours, NETs) of intestinal origin, followed by lung NETs,
and only in a minority of patients with pancreatic, ovarian, thymic, or
unknown origin (UKO) NETs. The main symptoms defining CS are skin
flushing, secretory diarrhoea, bronchospasm, or abdominal pain
(in some cases of advanced intestinal NETs) in the presence of sys-
temically elevated levels of serotonin and/or other biologically active
amins and peptides. Patients with CS suffer from an impaired quality
of life (QoL), which is lower when compared to patients without CS or
other types of cancer.2
Carcinoid heart disease (CHD) is a rare and complex cardiac com-
plication occurring in patients with advanced NETs and CS, usually
manifesting mainly as right-sided heart valves regurgitation/stenosis
(see Section A. d.) and eventually leading to right heart failure (RHF).
2.2
|
b. Pathophysiology
CS is caused by tumoural secretion of multiple hormonal amines and
peptides. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is the major secreta-
gogue in CS, with a proposed pathophysiological role in diarrhoea and
fibrotic complications; other hormones involved include histamine,
tachykinins, kallikrein and prostaglandins.2 Because tumour-released
active hormones are usually inactivated by the liver, CS indicates the
presence of (metastatic) tumour sites outside of the portal venous
drainage.3 Liver metastases are present in 87%–100% of patients with
CS. However, in 5%–13% of cases, CS may develop in the absence of
liver metastases, particularly if the primary tumour arises from the
ovary, testis or very rarely lung, or if a large burden of retroperitoneal
tumour disease is present.4,5
CHD is characterised by plaque-like fibrous deposits on right-
sided heart valves and endocardial surfaces, inducing tricuspid valve
regurgitation/stenosis and pulmonary valve regurgitation/stenosis,
ultimately leading to right ventricular volume overload and right heart
failure. Elevated levels of hormones, particularly serotonin, in the right
heart are deemed causative for CHD-associated plaque formation.
Left-sided valve involvement may occur either in the presence of a
patent foramen ovale (PFO), a functioning lung NET, and/or in cases
with very high circulating levels of vasoactive substances, overwhelm-
ing the hepatic and pulmonary degradative capacity.6

c. Epidemiology
The prevalence of CS among patients with NETs has varied widely,
ranging from 3% to 74% in the past, to 19% to 35% to date,
depending on world region and management.7 Median overall survival
in patients with CS is significantly reduced at 4.7 years compared to
7.1 years in NET patients without CS. Tumour burden is a relevant
contributor
to
CS-associated
mortality.4

d. Carcinoid crisis and other CS complications
Carcinoid crisis is a potentially life-threatening complication of uncon-
trolled CS caused by the sudden release of high levels of serotonin
and other vasoactive substances from a NET, especially in patients
with refractory CS (RCS; see Section C. b.). It can occur spontaneously,
but more frequently as result of tumour biopsy, surgical manipulation,
use of sympathomimetic drugs, anaesthesia or different cytolytic ther-
apies (hepatic embolisation) and sometimes because of peptide recep-
tor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). It is defined by abrupt flushing,
severe shifts in blood pressure with haemodynamic instability, profuse
diarrhoea, and distressing bronchospasm with wheezing2 (Table 3).
Other specific complications of CS patients are summarised in
Table 3.9

B. DIAGNOSIS
The presence of CS should be actively scrutinised by history taking, physi-
cal examination, and laboratory analysis.
Q1: How should the clinician assess a patient with suspected CS
and CHD at presentation, and during the follow-up?
a. Clinical evaluation of these patients is challenging. However, some
clinical key findings may help when CS is suspected.10
• Diarrhoea is often the presenting symptom of CS, with a preva-
lence as high as 60–80% among NET patients with elevated uri-
nary 5-HIAA (u5-HIAA); it is defined as alterations in stool
consistency, frequency, volume, and weight. It may be intermittent
or continuous, and the coexistence of increased frequency (≥3
loose stools) as well as reduced consistency for greater than
4 weeks defines chronic diarrhoea. Personal/family history of
chronic/neoplastic gastrointestinal diseases, previous abdominal
surgery, and co-existence or history of pancreatic or systemic dis-
eases should also be investigated.11
• Flushing, a clinical hallmark of CS, is reported in over 90% of cases
(either by the patient and/or by his/her family members); it is an
intermittent or persistent sensation of warmth together with skin
erythema, usually involving the head, neck, and upper part of the
torso, with telangiectasia in longstanding disease. In CS, flushing is
usually not associated with sweating (‘dry flushing’). It is the result
of
circulating
vasoactive
substances,
inducing
cardiovascular
abnormalities (hypo-/hypertension, brady-/tachycardia). Specific
flushing features depend on the primary tumour and four different
types of flushing have been described in CS12:
 The first type is the diffuse, erythematous flush, usually affecting
the face, neck, and upper chest. This flush is commonly of
short duration, lasting from 1 to 5 min, and is related to the
debut of CS.

 The second type is similar to the first type but is violaceous and
may last longer, together with facial telangiectasia, being
observed in long-term CS from advanced intestinal NETs and is
normally not felt by the patients because they have become
adapted to the flushing reaction.
 The third type is prolonged, lasting for hours up to several
days, sometimes involving the whole body, being associated
with profuse lacrimation, swelling of the salivary glands,
hypotension, and facial oedema. It is usually associated with
lung NETs.
 The fourth type (mediated by histamine production), bright red
and patchy, may be seen in patients with chronic atrophic gas-
tritis and advanced type 1 gastric NETs. Rarely, type 3 gastric
NEN may lead to “atypical carcinoid syndrome” in which flushing
can be cherry red, patchy, sharply demarcated, serpiginous, and
pruritic.
• Bronchospasm is a rare manifestation of the CS, being reported in
approximately 15% of patients, tending to develop concurrently
with flushing, sneezing and dyspnoea and linked to histamine and
serotonin secretion by the tumour.10
• All patients with CS should be questioned and examined for symp-
toms and physical signs of CHD and consequent RHF including
fatigue, dyspnoea, elevated jugular venous pressure, heart mur-
murs, hepatomegaly, peripheral oedema, and/or ascites. Over 11–
27% of patients with moderate to severe tricuspid damage have no
or mild symptoms, resulting in delay in diagnosis.13 Because clinical
assessment alone lacks sensitivity to detect CHD, specific bio-
chemical and imaging examinations are required in all patients with
CS (Figure 1).
• Early malnutrition screening should be planned in all patients with
CS, and regularly repeated during follow-up.9
a. Biochemical evaluation14
• Serotonin or its main metabolite 5-HIAA should be measured at pre-
sentation in all patients with advanced intestinal NETs, in lung/
ovary NETs of any stage, in unknown origin (UKO) NETs with liver
metastases, and in every NET patient with suspected CS. 4A
 Whole blood serotonin assay is limited by its saturation in plate-
lets at 40 nmol/109 platelets, making it less suitable for CS
monitoring.
 Serotonin is metabolised to 5-HIAA.
• A 24-h u5-HIAA secretion above 50 μmol is considered com-
patible with the diagnosis of CS (u5-HIAA normal range: 2 to
9 mg/24 h or 10.4 to 46.8 μmol/24 h).
• Because a significant percentage of patients with elevated
u5-HIAA is asymptomatic, this screening should occur
regardless of CS. 3B
• u5-HIAA is significantly higher in patients with than without
CHD, and its peak level is a significant predictor of progres-
sive CHD.15
• u5-HIAA > 300 μmol confers a two- to three-fold increase in
risk of CHD development/progression.16
• The primary screening of u5-HIAA as a tumour marker is lim-
ited by incorrect sampling, serotonin-rich food, or serotonin-
ergic drugs intake, leading to false positive results. 3B
• Because of significant variability, u5-HIAA should be prefera-
bly analysed in two 24-h urine collections (the ratio of u-
5HIAA/creatinine in a spot urine may be used for follow-up
of patients with known elevated u5-HIAA levels).17 5A
 Plasma 5-HIAA is an alternative method18 effectively differenti-
ating CS patients from controls and correlating with the pres-
ence of CS and CHD.19 However its availability is limited. 3B
• Chromogranin A (CgA) has been suggested as a relevant marker for
CS and CHD, but levels do not differentiate between NET patients
with or without CS. 4D
• Plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) should
be evaluated as screening biomarker of CHD in all patients with
increased u5-HIAA and/or suspicious symptoms, at baseline and
follow-up (Figure 1). NT-pro-BNP belongs to a neurohormone fam-
ily released by the atria and ventricles in response to the increase
in wall stress as a result of volume and pressure overload.20,21 4A
 To date, NT-proBNP is considered the most useful adjunct
marker to echocardiography in screening for and monitoring of
CHD, as its median levels are significantly higher in patients
with than without CHD. 2B

 NT-proBNP measurement is highly recommended as a screen-
ing tool for identifying patients with high suspicion of CHD in
the context of CS. 2B
 For CHD detection, an NT-proBNP cut-off level of 235–
260 pg mL–1 (31 pmoL L–1) had shown sensitivity and specificity
of 87–92% and 80–91%, respectively (NT-proBNP normal
range: men under 70 years: < 100 pg mL–1, women under
70 years: < 150 pg mL–1, 70 years and over: < 300 pg mL–1).
• It should be noted that Negative Predictive Value of NT-
proBNP of < 260 pg mL–1 (31 pmoL L–1) is 97%.
• If NT-proBNP is > 260 pg mL–1, patients should be referred
for echocardiography investigation. 2B
• If NT-proBNP is < 260 pg mL–1, patients are very unlikely to
have CHD.
 NT-proBNP levels positively correlate with the severity of CS,
New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and over-
all mortality. Because CHD can develop and progress rapidly, it
is recommended to have a baseline NT-proBNP evaluation at
the time of CS diagnosis.8 3B
• Nutritional assessment in CS patients should include niacin (vitamin
B3) and vitamins A, B12, D, E, and K, in addition to the classic
nutritional parameters of cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin, iron,
folate, and ferritin.22 4B
a. Imaging studies for detailed description on imaging for NETs stag-
ing/restaging, please see the European Neuroendocrine Tumor
Society (ENETS) consensus guidelines for the standards of care in
NETs.23 In patients with CS the aims of imaging and preferred
imaging tools are shown in Table 4.24
• Contrast enhanced (CE) computed tomography (CT) including early
dynamic phases is a minimal standard for NETs staging/restaging
including hepatic tumour load determination as prognostic fac-
tor. 2B
• Liver magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using diffusion-weighted-
imaging and a liver-specific contrast agent is superior for the accurate
determination of number and size of lesions, therapy monitoring, or
planning possible hepatic surgery or loco-regional treatment. 2B
• Whole-body staging at initial diagnosis should be preferentially
performed using somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI), preferably
positron emission tomography (PET) and CECT or, alternatively,
somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, although the latter has a signif-
icantly lower sensitivity. 2B
• Quantitative assessment of tumour growth rate on sequential
cross sectional imaging studies can provide useful information on
tumour activity and prognosis.25 3B
 In CS patients under consideration for PRRT, especially in lung
NETs and G2/3 NETs, presence of somatostatin receptor-
negative lesions should be documented and further evaluation
with18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT should be performed. 4A
• An increased right-to-left ventricular width ratio on a regular CS
patient CECT can indicate the presence of tricuspid valve regurgita-
tion (TR) or pulmonary valve regurgitation (PR) and should be reported
as possible sign of CHD (after excluding pulmonary embolism).26
• In patients with high degree of suspicion of CS and non-conclusive
CECT, MRI and somatostatin receptor (SSTR) PET/CT,18F-DOPA
PET/CT may provide additional useful information. 3B
• See Q3 for specific imaging to assess CHD.
Q2: What is the differential diagnosis of CS?
The most common symptoms in CS (flushing, diarrhoea, their
combination) may represent manifestations of other clinical entities.
Also, patients with an established CS, on treatment, can experience
deterioration of their symptoms from other causes.27,28
• Diarrhoea in CS is always secretory, persists with fasting, may
occur during the night and is associated with abdominal discomfort
and faecal urgency.

 Sometimes, to prove “secretory” diarrhoea, an estimation of
faecal fluid “osmotic gap” is needed, with an “osmotic gap” of
< 50 mOsm kg–1 being diagnostic for secretory diarrhoea. 4C
 However, in other NETs (e.g., VIPomas, gastrinomas, medullary
thyroid carcinomas [MTC]), as well as in systemic mastocytosis,
diarrhoea is also secretory, and the differential diagnosis should
be based primarily on laboratory findings.
• Patients with CS treated with somatostatin analogues (SSA) may
experience deterioration of previously controlled diarrhoea, or
ongoing diarrhoea which never responded to SSA. Other causes of
diarrhoea, NET-related (steatorrhoea secondary to SSA, small
intestinal bacterial overgrowth, mesenteric ischaemia, bile salt mal-
absorption or short-bowel syndrome), or NEN-unrelated (colitis,
gastroenteritis), need to be excluded. 5A
 The diagnosis of steatorrhoea as a result of SSA-induced pancre-
atic insufficiency is based on stool features (pale, “oily”, difficult
to be flushed from the toilet) and may be confirmed by low fae-
cal elastase or pragmatically by a trial of pancreatic enzymes. 5B
 Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is noted in patients with
mesenteric fibrosis or multiple previous surgery, being associ-
ated also with bloating and/or flatulence and its diagnosis is
established with an “H2 breath test”. 4B
 Mesenteric ischaemia-related diarrhoea can be suspected by the
patient's history and abdominal CECT findings.
 Patients who have undergone right hemicolectomy may develop
bile salt malabsorption-associated diarrhoea. This diagnosis is usu-
ally based on history and confirmed, when available, with
tauroselcholic (selenium-75) acid (SeHCAT) scan, or pragmati-
cally by a trial with bile acid sequestrants. 4B
 A short bowel syndrome, defined as a length of functional small
bowel < 200 cm may occur after extensive intestinal resection.
• Flushing in the context of CS has been described in Section B.
 Flushing can be noted in other NENs (MTC) as well as in some
non-NENs entities (menopause, systemic mastocytosis, anxiety).
 The key characteristics allowing the distinction of CS-associated
flushing from flushing from other causes are summarised in
Table 5.
Q3: Which tools are needed to characterise severity of CHD?
CHD quantification requires careful clinical, biochemical, echocar-
diographic, and radiological assessment.29,30
• Clinical examination for signs of CHD and related RHF is notori-
ously unreliable and should be looked for, but not relied upon, as
an adequate screening tool.
• NT-proBNP is the most sensitive biomarker to date for the pres-
ence and severity of CHD and should be measured in all patients
with elevated u5-HIAA, regardless of CS (see also Section on bio-
chemical investigation, Q1). 4A
• CHD diagnosis and monitoring by severity quantification is chal-
lenging and focusses on functional imaging of the left and right
chambers of the heart.
 Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is the key investigation
for CHD diagnosis and monitoring by using the ENETS CHD TF
Echo synoptic score.31 This should be ideally undertaken by an
experienced professional in CHD. Additional experienced TTE
imaging of the pulmonary valve involvement provides informa-
tion needed to determine degree of valve disease. 2B
 TTE should include an ‘agitated saline contrast study’ to identify
a PFO. 2B
 Stress echocardiography does not provide any additional informa-
tion. Cardiopulmonary exercise may play a role in assessment of
asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic patients with CHD who
have enlarged RV with impaired right ventricular (RV) function.
 Advanced ultrasound techniques, such as 3D TTE or 3D trans-
oesophageal
echocardiography
(TOE),
may

identifying and assessing valve pathology. 3D TTE could be
valuable in the assessment of right ventricular size and func-
tion. 3C
 Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and cardiac CT
(CCT) are useful additional modalities, used when TTE images
are inadequate or in pre-operative planning (Table 6).32 3B
 At the same time, it should be noted that assessment of severity
of pulmonary vein (PV) involvement with echocardiography can
be difficult and misleading, and functional assessment of pulmo-
nary regurgitation with MRI should also be measured and inter-
preted with care.
 Full cardiac CT (requiring a high-pitch or high-volume CT scan-
ner) allows excellent anatomical visualisation of the pulmonary
valve. In addition, it allows assessment of coronary arteries, rela-
tionship of cardiac metastases (if present) with regard to coro-
nary arteries, and RV function assessment being mostly utilised
in pre-operative planning.33 3B

C. THERAPY
Q4: Which are the principles/aims of treatment in a patient with
CS?34,35
Patients with untreated CS often present with debilitating symp-
toms (diarrhoea, flushing, bronchoconstriction, abdominal pain, niacin
deficiency-related symptoms) and may develop long-term complica-
tions, such as CHD, with a major negative impact on patient's health-
related quality of life (HRQoL). All patients with CS should be
promptly treated aiming:
• To achieve maximal symptom control and ideally normal u5-HIAA
levels. 2bA
• To control or reduce tumour burden. 1bA
• To prevent the appearance/progression/recurrence of CHD.3bA
• In patients with CHD, to anticipate the development of irreversible
ventricular dysfunction and to avoid any delay in valvular treat-
ment. 3bA
• To improve patients' nutritional status and HRQoL.1bACS treat-
ment is challenging. The availability of multiple therapeutic options
favours a personalised approach. NET-specific therapies are
addressed in dedicated ENETS guidelines.
Q5: How to manage CS?
a. First line management
• SSA, octreotide or lanreotide, are the mainstay of CS treat-
ment.34,36 SSA bind to SSTR which are expressed by most NET
cells, the presence of which is confirmed by increased tumour
uptake on SRI. SSA inhibit the secretion of several hormones and
vasoactive substances, improving symptoms in up to 70% and
decreasing
u5-HIAA
levels
in
approximately
46%
of
CS
patients. 2aA
• It is not mandatory, but strongly recommended, to have a positive
SRI to start therapy with SSA (Consensus opinion). 2B
• Octreotide is available as a short-acting subcutaneous/intravenous
or a long-acting release (octreotide LAR) formulations, the latter
being administered intramuscularly 30 mg/4 weeks. Because drug
concentration reaches a plateau at 14 days from injection, patients
with mild CS can start with octreotide LAR 30 mg alone. 2bA
• Lanreotide Autogel® is available as a depot formulation of 60 mg,
90 mg
and
120 mg
and
administered
s.c.
at
a
dose
of
120 mg/4 weeks; drug concentration reaches a steady state in the
first day, dispensing the need for concomitant short-acting
octreotide.
• When CS symptoms are moderate/severe, administration of the
long-acting SSA (octreotide LAR or lanreotide Autogel®) should be
combined with short-acting octreotide 100 μg to 500 μg every 6–
8 h, for up to 2 weeks or as a rescue therapy when CS is not con-
trolled. 3bA
• SSA are safe and well-tolerated, with only 1 to 11% of patients
requiring discontinuation as a result of adverse events.
• Short-term adverse events are mild, including pain/engorgement at
injection site, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, flatulence, and
hyperglycaemia.
• Long-term adverse events include fibrotic nodules at injection
sites, cholelithiasis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, occurring
in 5%–15% of cases; diabetic patients need close follow-up, as
anti-glycaemic treatment intensification may be needed.
 Prophylactic cholecystectomy to avoid cholelithiasis should be
considered cautiously during resection of primary small bowel
NETs because it may worsen diarrhoea in patients with previous
small bowel resection.37

 Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (steatorrhoea) develops in
almost one-quarter of patients receiving SSA, with more than
90% occurring after 6–24 months of treatment; it can be
treated with oral pancreatic enzymes supplements.38,39
• Dose reduction of octreotide LAR from 30 mg to 20 mg and
lanreotide Autogel® from 120 mg to 90 mg can be offered to
patients who are intolerant of higher dosages. Alternatively, the
injection frequency can be reduced beyond every 4 weeks.
• Although there are no randomised controlled trials powered to
directly compare SSA for CS, octreotide and lanreotide are similarly
safe and effective in managing CS and tumour growth. 3bA
a. Second and further lines of management — refractory CS (RCS)40–42
RCS is defined by recurring or persisting CS symptoms and increas-
ing or persistently high u5-HIAA levels despite the use of maximum label
doses of SSA. RCS may be divided into either non-aggressive or
aggressive, based on symptoms burden (< or ≥4 BM/day, and/or < or
≥5 flushing episodes/day, respectively) together with disease stability
(stable or progressive), hepatic burden (< or ≥50% liver involvement),
and/or the presence of CHD.
Patients with RCS may suffer from an incapacitating burden of
symptoms, as well as CS-related complications such as CHD.
• The initial work-up of suspected RCS consists of a thorough investi-
gation of the differential diagnosis of worsening CS symptoms,
measurement of u5-HIAA and appropriate tumour imaging.
• The causes of RCS remain obscure, but radiological and/or bio-
chemical tumour progression should be differentiated from the dif-
ferential diagnoses of worsening CS.
• Differential diagnosis of RCS (Figure 2) includes problems with SSA
administration, SSA tachyphylaxis, SSA-induced exocrine pancre-
atic insufficiency, infectious/inflammatory diarrhoea, mesenteric
fibrosis, and worsening of diarrhoea in patients whose primary
small bowel NET was surgically removed.
 Clinicians should be aware of causes of false positive elevations
of u5-HIAA, such as serotonin-reuptake receptor inhibitors,
acetaminophen,
and
consumption
of
serotonin-rich
foods
(e.g., bananas, pineapple, tomatoes, plums, eggplant, avocado,
kiwi, fruits in general, nuts) prior to the urinary test.
 Decreased SSA absorption consequent to fibrosis at the injec-
tion sites may develop in patients receiving long-term SSA.
 Worsening of CS 2–3 weeks after SSA injection may imply
tachyphylaxis; more frequent doses (octreotide LAR 30 mg/2–
3 weeks
or
lanreotide
Autogel®
120 mg/2 weeks),
[2bA]
increased octreotide LAR dosage to 60 mg every 4 weeks or
switching to the alternative SSA can be considered. 3bA
Overall, SSA dose-escalation offers symptom improvement in
nearly 80% of cases, whereas only 29% of patients show further
reduction in u5-HIAA levels.42
• It is important to re-assess all patients with RCS for CHD with an
echocardiogram and NT-proBNP (see CHD work-up session).Once
administration problems and differential diagnoses are excluded,
NET-directed therapies should be added to SSA, aiming at tumour
control that also improve CS (dose-escalation of SSA, loco-regional
therapies, PRRT, everolimus and interferon-alpha) or direct hor-
mone secretion control (telotristat ethyl).
The best therapeutic sequence for RCS has not been yet deter-
mined by randomised trials, and it should be decided based on sever-
ity of RCS and tumour status37 (Figure 3). Importantly, SSA should be
continued throughout all treatment lines of CS.

sion and low symptom/tumour burden

Importantly, in the presence of CHD, the optimal sequence of car-
diac and liver surgery must be determined in an individual fashion
based on the severity and symptoms of CHD and on multi-
disciplinary team (MDT) discussion.42 There is limited evidence
from retrospective studies that hepatic resection can reduce pro-
gression of CHD and improve prognosis significantly in eligible
patients. By contrast, upfront valve replacement should be consid-
ered prior to hepatic surgery, in the presence of already progres-
sive/significant CHD, to prevent complications because of a
“pulsatile” liver and enable curative/cytoreductive surgical strate-
gies. Small retrospective series revealed similar survival after
hepatic resection in patients with or without CHD, thus suggesting
an important role for valve replacement and interval hepatic resec-
tion. It is worthwhile mentioning that precise evidence-based
criteria for the above have not been published.
 Loco-regional therapies may be considered for patients with pre-
dominant liver inoperable metastases, requiring CS control. 3aA
Hepatic trans-arterial embolisation (TAE), trans-arterial chemo-
embolisation (TACE) or trans-arterial radioembolisation/selective
internal radiotherapy (TARE/SIRT) controls CS symptoms in up to
75% cases and can be repeated if there is preserved liver
function.43,44 For patients with CS and G1 intestinal NET, where
chemotherapy offers little benefit, bland hepatic embolisation is
preferred. 3aB.
TACE/SIRT may be reserved for G2 intestinal or non-intestinal NET.
3bB In the absence of conclusive data on which trans-arterial treat-
ment is most efficient, the selection should be made based on
individual factors such as tumour load, topography of metastases, and
arterial anatomy.

option for NET patients.
with positive SRI and RCS, with significant decrease in diarrhoea,
pain, fatigue, and flushing, and > 30% decrease in u5-HIAA in 56%
of patients.45,46 3bB
 A small series demonstrated that everolimus combined with
octreotide LAR led to symptom relief in RCS.46,47 In the RADI-
ANT 2 phase III trial, more pronounced reduction in u5-HIAA
favored everolimus and octreotide compared with octreotide
alone.48 Despite its low evidence as an anti-secretory agent,
everolimus has proven antitumour activity in NET and can be
considered in RCS patients. 4C
 The anti-secretory effects of interferon alpha (IFN-α) may be
useful in RCS patients. 2bB
In several single-arm prospective series, the response rates to IFN-
α have been up to 90% for clinical and 80% for biochemical con-
trol. A multicentre randomised study combining IFN-α with SSA
did not demonstrate a significant beneficial effect versus SSA alone
for symptom control. The recommended dose of IFN-α is 3–9 MU
s.c. every other day. A slow-release formulation of 50–100 μg
PEGylated IFN-α is given s.c. once a week. However, the low toler-
ability of the drug has limited its use.49
 Chemotherapy or tyrosine kinases inhibitors are rarely used in clin-
ical practice in CS, being considered mainly as an anti-tumour
option for lung/pancreatic/thymic NENs. 3bD

Most data on chemotherapy for RCS are old and inconsistently
describe CS-specific outcomes, restricted only to a 5-HIAA
response rates of approximately 31%. Therefore, their role in
symptom control in CS is limited. 4D
 All the upper mentioned therapeutic options, and specifically liver-
related procedures, should be discussed within an MDT with a high
degree of caution and defined as contra-indicated in patients with
limited liver residual function, in the presence of moderate/severe
ascites and/or concomitant physical/echocardiographic signs of
severe right heart failure, and/or when patient performance status
is low.
 Telotristat ethyl (an oral inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, the
rate-limiting enzyme of serotonin synthesis), significantly reduced
RCS-associated diarrhoea and u5-HIAA in clinical trials and in
real-world patients.50,51 The recommended dose is 250 mg TID;
side effects include mild abdominal pain and nausea. 1bB
• Treatment of RCS with radiologically progressive NET and/ or high
symptom burden
 SSA should be continued, with their dosage being optimised.
 Telotristat ethyl should be added to SSA, where available, for
control of RCS-associated diarrhoea. 1bB
 PRRT in the setting of very high tumour burden and progressive
liver disease together with RCS and/or CHD is a matter of
debate. Hepatic tumour burden per se prior to PRRT does not
appear to be associated with an increased risk of liver toxicity52;
however, liver failure is possible in patients with massive tumour
bulk and RCS. Therefore, careful individualised decisions, taken
within an MDT, and consideration of reducing the dosages of
PRRT and alternating them with possible valve-replacement, are
recommended in these severely-ill patients. 3bB
 Hepatic resection/loco-regional therapies are effective for CS, as
mentioned earlier, but not recommended if severe CHD is pre-
sent; in this situation, valve replacement should be performed
prior to surgical debulking/loco-regional interventions. 3aB
 The other therapeutic options listed for patients with RCS and
stable/indolent disease and/or mild symptom burden also apply
to more aggressive RCS, preferably after treatment with PRRT.
a. Treatment of carcinoid crisis
• We recommend prophylactic short-acting octreotide prior to and
during invasive procedures—to be tapered down afterwards, or
continuous infusions when major surgical/loco-regional interven-
tions are considered or when there is concurrent CHD. 3b
 We propose doses of s.c. octreotide of 100–500 μg every 6–8 h
or i.v. octreotide infused at a starting dose of 50 μg h–1,
increased to 100–200 μg h–1 if necessary, 12 h pre-operatively
and before anaesthesia, continuously throughout the procedure
and post-operatively until the patient is clinically stable.37,53,54 3bA
• For patients starting PRRT and using short-acting SSA, this should
be continued up to 8–24 h prior to administration and restarted 8–
24 h after PRRT.55 4A
• Despite prophylactic measures, carcinoid crisis is not entirely pre-
ventable and requires prompt recognition intraoperatively and
aggressive treatment including intravenous fluids, corticosteroids,
and vasopressors.
• Sympathomimetics can precipitate hormonal release by the tumour
paradoxically leading to distributive shock and should be used cau-
tiously in patient with CS. However, if a CS patient needs to be on
sympathomimetics (e.g., patients in an intensive care unit on
hypovolemic or septic shock), a simultaneous i.v. octreotide infu-
sion to prevent carcinoid crisis is recommended and the selective
alpha1-agonist phenylephrine and vasopressin are the preferred
vasopressors in this context. 4A
a. Supportive therapeutic strategies
• Nutrition counselling is recommended to improve nutrition status,
control diarrhoea, and avoid foods that trigger carcinoid symptoms.
4AIn patients with short bowel syndrome, anti-diarrhoeal agents, such
as loperamide, may be useful. Patients with niacin deficiency or pella-
gra should be started on niacin or nicotinamide 200–250 mg PO once
daily with further treatment tailored to circulating levels. 4A.
Ultimately, all patients develop symptomatic progression of CS
when on an SSA. Therefore, once CS treatment is initiated, physicians
should actively monitor the patient's status for a clinical, biochemical,
and radiological response. Symptom relief should be monitored
monthly in the first 2–3 months and, once achieved, at intervals of 4–
6 months. Biochemical and imaging tests can be evaluated every 4–
6 months. 4B.
Q6: What are the general recommendations for the initial man-
agement of CHD?56
All patients diagnosed with CHD should be managed by a MDT
(see also Q11).57 2A
• The two main goals of management are aggressive reduction of hor-
monal secretion by the tumour and management of CHD and RHF,
when present. A holistic approach must be taken, with consider-
ation of NET status, CHD severity/symptoms, and nutritional and
general performance status of the patient.58,59
 For tumour and CS control (see also Q5).
 In patients with symptomatic RHF, standard treatments, includ-
ing loop/thiazide diuretics, aldosterone antagonist therapy and
cautious fluid and salt restriction, can improve patient's symp-
toms but must be used judiciously to avoid a paradoxical wors-
ening of symptoms because of a reduction in cardiac output.
The doses depend on the individual context, patients' blood
pressure, renal function, other co-morbidities, or medications.
 Patients with CHD require lifelong clinical, biochemical, and
echocardiographic monitoring to facilitate early identification of
disease progression. It is important to note that CHD can pro-
gress rapidly, and patients should have regular NT-proBNP and
echocardiograms at intervals of 6–12 months.60 4A

Q7: Do's and don'ts in CS/severe CHD
Do's:
• Echocardiograms should thoroughly describe each affected valve
including leaflet thickening, mobility, degree of regurgitation and
stenosis, and assessment of right ventricular size and function. 3A
• During CECT/MRI for NET staging, the contrast flow rate must be
lowered in patients with severe cardiac impairment, and one
should be aware of the longer circulation time when timing con-
trast phases and interpreting the images. 5B
• Guidelines for the fluid and amino-acid infusion (volume, rate),
as well as the flow rate of 177Lutetium-DOTATATE in the pres-
ence of CHD, are unavailable. However, based on clinical experi-
ence, some leading centres will extend the duration of infusion
of amino-acid (LysArg) by decreasing the infusion rate from
250 mL h–1 to 175–200 mL h–1 and decrease the total volume
to 50%–75%; alternatively, other expert centres recommend
regular amino-acid infusion rate at 250 mL h–1, directly followed
by a single injection of furosemide 40 mg, particularly in patients
with severe CHD and elevated jugular venous pressure or
peripheral oedema (the total volume and rate of infusion should
be titrated to the cardiac function and coordinated with the
MDT cardiologist) (Consensus opinion). 5B
Don'ts:
• Besides SSA, do not administer systemic/loco-regional therapies
before assessing cardiac status as carcinoid crisis may occur
inducing cardiac decompensation (high grade of caution is
needed).
• Cessation of SSA before SRI or PRRT is not recommended (use res-
cue s.c. or i.v. octreotide or adjust date of SRI/PRRT to be at the
end of SSA monthly administration) in uncontrolled CS/CHD
patients. 3bB
• Do not start second-line therapies without a proper evaluation of
the differential diagnosis of RCS. 3bB
Q8: What is the appropriate surgical management of CHD?61,62,63
a. Methods
• Surgical valve replacement is the established CHD treatment.64 3bA
• Minimally invasive cardiac surgery has a limited role in CHD, as a
full sternotomy is required to access both the pulmonary valve (PV)
and tricuspid valve (TV) in the same procedure.65 4D
• Percutaneous valve-in-valve procedures are feasible in degenera-
tive surgical valves in CHD, which is a further argument for using
bio-prostheses as the primary option in valvular replacement sur-
gery (see also Q10). 4B
• Percutaneous pulmonary and tricuspid valves are available, but
data on placement in patients with CHD are currently lac-
king.65 4D
a. Indications for cardiac surgery
• Severe symptomatic CHD (e.g., fatigue, dyspnoea, oedema, ascites)
with at least 12 months of anticipated post-operative NET-related
survival. 3bA
• RV dilatation should not represent, per se, an indication for surgery in
asymptomatic NET patients.
 A close cardiologic follow-up is required, not to delay surgery as
soon as the first symptoms are present and to avoid escalation
of medical treatment.
 Asymptomatic
patients
with
severe
RV
enlargement
and
reduced RV systolic function and normal exercise capacity are
unlikely to derive symptomatic benefit from surgery. The overall
prognosis of these patients depends on multiple factors with
the major determinant being the underlying NET status and
prognosis. Those cases should be discussed in detail by the
CHD MDT, as well as with the patient, and a decision should be
made on a case-by-case basis. 3bA
a. Timing of surgery
• The optimal timing of valve replacement should be individualised
and decided when the patient has a clear indication (see above),
under optimal treatment following MDT assessment and has pro-
vided informed consent.66 3aA
• In a large cohort of 240 operated patients from the Mayo Clinic,
survival was significantly better in patients with any lower pre-
operative NYHA class. At the same time, valve operation in
asymptomatic patients was not associated with survival benefit.67
• By consensus, following MDT discussion, patients referred for car-
diac surgery should have evidence of symptomatic RHF, with at
least 12 months of anticipated post-operative survival from their
NET disease. 4B
• Be mindful when it is too late for cardiac surgery (e.g., severe
uncontrolled CS and RHF in a patient with high tumour burden and
limited hepatic/cardiac/performance status reserve).
a. Pre-operative assessment
• Assess the presence of PFO with a baseline “bubble” contrast TTE
or intraoperative TOE imaging; it should be closed at the time of
valve surgery. 4B
• Assess coronary status by coronary angiography (CA) or coronary
computerized tomography (CCT). 4B
• Assess valves by TTE (if necessary, TOE) and CMR for evaluating
the valves, both ventricle's volume and function. Be aware that,
with severe TR, PV involvement degree could be underestimated
and that functional assessment of PR severity either with echocar-
diography or MRI could be misleading.68 4B
• Assessment of valve size can be achieved using CCT.32 4B
• Assess liver/renal/coagulation tests and perform carotid Dopp-
ler. 4B

• Consider cardiopulmonary exercise testing in patients with CHD

status. 4B

for an experienced anaesthetist in dealing with CHD patients

a. Surgical management of CHD
• Cardiac surgery, which primarily consists of valve replacement, is
the most effective treatment option for advanced CHD. 3bA
 In patients with severe cardiac involvement and well-controlled
systemic disease, valve replacement surgery is an effective
treatment modality that can markedly improve symptoms and
contribute to an improved outcome.67,68
 In a study of 240 patients operated on at the Mayo Clinic, the
overall survival estimates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 69%, 48%,
and 34%.69
 Short-term survival is improved with surgery70: in a study by
Edwards et al.,71 1- and 2-year survival rates after surgery were
75% and 69% versus 45% and 15% on medical treatment only,
when 32 patients with CHD were operated on versus 15 who
were deemed unsuitable for intervention.
• 30-day mortality post-surgery has markedly declined over time37,38
with increasing volume of patients operated on in selected
institutions.69
• There is marked symptomatic improvement after valve replace-
ment surgery in CHD patients, with majority of patients being re-
classified as NYHA class I post-operatively67,72,73
• Patients undergoing combined tricuspid valve replacement (TVR)
and pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) had significantly higher
survival compared to operations without PVR, when involvement
of PV into CHD led to more than mild PR.71
• The feasibility of quadruple valve replacement leading to mar-
ked functional improvement has also been reported by several
groups.66
• In a recent metanalysis74 consisting of 416 pre-operative
patients, 97% had moderate or severe TR, 72% moderate or
severe PR, and 33% with PS with or without regurgitation. Left
heart characteristics included mitral valve regurgitation (MR) in
24% and aortic valve regurgitation (AR) in 18% of patients.
 TR is usually the predominant lesion in CHD, and all patients
with severe TR are candidates for TVR unless surgery is
contraindicated.
 PVR with patch enlargement of the right ventricular outflow
tract is performed for management of PR and to facilitate
implantation of the PV prosthesis of optimal size.74
 Mitral valve replacement (MVR) may be performed, depending
on the severity of mitral valve (MV) involvement.
 Aurtic valve replacement (AVR) is the option for CHD involve-
ment of the aortic valve (AV).
• Additional procedures
include PFO closure and
removal of
intramyocardial metastasis.
 The presence of a PFO should always be researched during sur-
gery (and closed if present) even if not diagnosed during the
pre-operative assessment.
• Because of increased risk of development of high-degree AV block
post TV replacement, it is common practice to implant RV epicar-
dial and right atrial (if in sinus rhythm prior to surgery and for pos-
sibility of A-V sequential pacing) pacing wires.75 This should be
considered in patients undergoing cardiac reoperation.
a. Choice of valve prosthesis
• The decision on the type of prosthesis should be individualised
based on the risk of bleeding, the specific tumour-related life
expectancy, and possible future therapeutic interventions.75
• The use of mechanical valves should be discouraged having several
disadvantages:
 The need for anticoagulation therapy, which may be problem-
atic in a patient with liver metastases.
 The increased risk of thrombosis of mechanical prostheses in
the tricuspid and pulmonic position.
• Bioprosthetic valves are the recommended option73 because of the
inherent increased risk of bleeding in patients with advanced high-
volume liver disease and hepatic dysfunction from NET, the
increased likelihood of invasive procedures requiring temporary
discontinuation of anticoagulant agents, and, to a lesser extent, the
risk of right-sided mechanical valve thrombosis.
 If new NET-associated structural valve deterioration occurs in
biological prostheses, it can likely be treated with catheter-
based valve-in-valve re-replacement. 4A
• Optimisation of CS treatment after cardiac surgery may protect
bioprosthetic valves from the adverse effects of increased NET
vasoactive and hormonal products. The prosthesis dysfunction
related to carcinoid rate eventually is reduced by the aggressive
normalisation of 5-HIAA under SSA therapy with potential additive
therapy (Figure 2). 3bA
a. Post-operative care and follow-up should include
• Perform u5-HIAA/NT-proBNP regularly every 3–6 months aiming
for their near/normalisation (u5-HIAA at least < 300 μmol/24 h), to
prevent CHD recurrence which may be rapid in patients with
RCS. 5B
• Assess patient's QoL improvement, as well as optimal management
of symptoms. 5B

• Perform echocardiography post-operatively, then 3 months after
stopping vitamin K antagonist (VKA) to confirm normal prosthetic
valve function, and then 6–12 months later, and review every 6–
12 months, based on patient's condition. 5B
• Post-operatively, following bioprosthetic valve replacement, either
VKA or novel oral anticoagulants are recommended for 3–
6 months, with a preference for VKA albeit not supported by ran-
domised trials (Consensus opinion). 5B
 Bioprosthetic valve function should be reassessed 1–3 months
following initiation of anticoagulation to reassess prosthesis
function. 5B
 Additional imaging with CT or TOE can be considered when bio-
prosthetic valve dysfunction is identified and TTE imaging is
suboptimal. 5B
• Causes for bioprosthetic valve dysfunction should be considered
such as thrombosis, infection or plaque formation related to CHD.
5B If bioprosthetic valve gradients increase by 50%, there is new
abnormal leaflet thickening, abnormal leaflet mobility or prosthetic
regurgitation following anticoagulation cessation, anticoagulation
should be restarted and bioprosthetic valves reassessed in 1–
3 months.76 5B
• If early (< 3 years) bioprosthetic valve deterioration occurs, throm-
bus should be considered and evaluation with TOE or CCT should
be performed.77,78
Q9: “Nonsurgical” interventional options for CHD8
• The experience with minimally invasive options (percutaneous
catheter-based interventions, valve-in-valve replacements) is limited;
however, this approach will play a growing role in the future, as:
 Valve-in-valve replacement is feasible in degenerated surgical
bioprosthesis, and should be the first choice in CHD patients.79
• The mechanism of degeneration should be evaluated and if
there are features of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis, VKA
should be tried initially if the patient is clinically stable
• Endocarditis should be excluded as a cause for bioprosthetic
valve
degeneration
prior
to
considering
valve-in-valve
treatment.
 For first-time procedures, percutaneous valve implantation has
been reported for the pulmonary valve in CHD in selected
patients.
 Conversely to the left side, the risk of outflow tract obstruction,
para-valvular leaks, and haemolysis is low.
 The expected valve durability in this low-pressure environment
is probably better but valve thrombosis remains a concern in
transcatheter valves.
• A study (TRICAR), evaluating whether valved stent graft implant
reduces TR and improves the symptoms and QoL in CHD patients
who are unable to have a new valve via a surgical procedure, is
ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05064514).
Q10: What are the advantages of MDT approach in improving
the overall management of CS and CHD patients?
Decisions for optimal management of patients with moderate to
severe CHD, as part of advanced NEN and CS, are complex and
require a “holistic” approach as well as close collaboration between
NEN Physicians and Cardiac Specialists. A dedicated CHD MDT will
facilitate the optimal patient's medical treatment and define the
appropriate type, as well as optimal timing for cardiac intervention
(surgical/catheter based).
The CHD MDT, which can run separately or be a part of the main
NEN MDT, will discuss patients with significant (moderate/severe or
progressing) CHD who have been assessed in the cardiology/CHD
clinic and fulfil the echocardiogram and/or clinical criteria for cardiac
intervention. If the CHD MDT runs separately, all referred patients
need to have been previously discussed at the main NEN MDT meet-
ing, where decisions about control of hormonal secretion and tumour
growth should have been made.
CHD
MDT
mandatory
members
include
NEN
physician(s),
cardiologist(s) with expertise in CHD (preferable), cardio-thoracic
surgeon(s), cardiac anesthetist, NEN and cardiology specialist nurses,
and a dedicated nutritionist.
Several factors associated to the heart, NEN disease and patient’
status and preferences need to be considered. Cardiovascular symp-
toms (NYHA class), RV function, tricuspid and left-sided cardiac valves
(through echocardiography) and pulmonary valve (through TTE/TOE,
CCT/CMRI) need to be thoroughly reviewed alongside NEN disease
status (stable/progressing) and tumour burden, as well as patient-
related factors including comorbidities, major organ function, and
nutritional status.
CHD MDT members need to:
• Evaluate the risk of heart intervention as opposed to the patient's
anticipated outcome if no interventional cardiac treatment is
offered.
• Evaluate NET status (stable or progressing) and the oncological
prognosis in relation to cardiosurgical risk.
• Assess the effect of CHD on the management of NEN disease
overall.
• Determine
whether
a
cardiac
intervention
in
asymptomatic
patients could facilitate future NEN treatments.
• Assess major organ function (liver and kidney).
• Assess patient's nutritional and overall performance status.
• Decisions need to be made about the type of intervention and
timeframe.Following the CHD MDT outcome, the patient should
be informed for the final treatment decision through an informed
consent. The NET patient needs to accept the acute risk related to
cardiac surgery as opposed to long-term risk of congestive heart
failure, alongside the overall prognosis of NET disease.

• CS related unmet needs:
 Elucidate specific hormonal contributors to CS symptoms in
individual patients.
 Discover diagnostic biomarkers that more completely encom-
pass the full clinical spectrum of CS.
 Further develop and implement blood-based assays for seroto-
nin and/or 5-HIAA in the diagnosis and follow-up of CS.
 Develop and validate prognostic markers of survival outcome
and predictive factors for QoL improvement and response to
therapy in CS.
 Understand the biological mechanisms of resistance of CS-
directed therapies.
 Unravel the biological drivers of CS, paving the way towards the
discovery of novel drug targets.
 Optimal treatment sequencing across the spectrum of CS, in the
presence or absence of progressive disease and with the aim to
prevent CS-related complications.
 Invest in the design and execution of multicentre clinical trials
specifically for CS patients, using well-defined and validated
criteria for patient inclusion and definition of clinically relevant
therapeutic endpoints.
• CHD related unmet needs:
 Elucidate the role of catheter-based cardiovascular therapies in
selected group of patients.
 Unravel the right time for the cardiac intervention (when patient
is symptomatic or when is asymptomatic/minimally symptom-
atic but with progressive dilatation of RV size and deterioration
of RV function).
 Asses the role of functional assessment using cardiopulmonary
exercise testing for optimal timing of intervention.
 In terms of heart surgery, evaluate prognostic indicators in CHD
patients versus in patients with CHD-unrelated valvular heart
disease.
 Evaluate how accurate is the overall prognosis of patients with
NET, when determining a surgical intervention.
 Assess the impact of cardiac intervention on the course of
disease.
 Biological prognostic markers of more aggressive CS and CHD
are needed.
 The biological drivers of CHD need to be unravelled.

E. SUMMARY
This ENETS guidance paper, developed by a multidisciplinary
consensus task force, provides up-to-date and practical advice on
the diagnosis and management of CS and CHD, based on recent
developments and using the recent ENETS Echo synoptic report
in
CHD
patients.31
Hopefully,
these
recommendations
will
pave the road for more standardised care for our CS and CHD
patients resulting in improved outcomes. Upcoming studies aimed
to fulfill the gap will allow us to focus on many unmet needs in
this field.
