Abstract
Both the incidence and prevalence of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours
from the small intestine (Si-NET) are gradually increasing. Most patients have non-
functioning tumours with subtle GI symptoms and tumours are often discovered
incidentally by endoscopy or at advanced disease stages by imaging depicting mes-
enteric lymph node and /or liver metastases while around 30% of the patients pre-
sent with symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome. Adequate biochemical assessment
and staging including functional imaging is crucial for treatment-related decision-
making that should take place in an expert multidisciplinary team setting. Preferably,
patients should be referred to specialised ENETS Centres of Excellence or centres
of high expertise in the field. This guidance paper provides the current evidence
and best knowledge for the management of Si-NET grade (G) 1–3 following 10 key
questions of practical relevance for the diagnostic and therapeutic decision making.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) arising from the small intestine
(Si-NEN) are considered rare malignancies. Despite this, both the
incidence and prevalence are gradually increasing.1 NENs are
divided into well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NET) and
poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) according
to the most recent World Health Organization (WHO) 2022 classi-
fication. NEC are very rare among Si-NEN and covered in a sepa-
rate ENETS Guidance paper2 Grading is an essential component of
the WHO classification. Si-NETs are graded as follows: NET G1 (Ki-
67 <3%; <2 mitotic count in 2 mm2), NET G2 (Ki-67 3%–20%;
mitotic count 2–20 in 2 mm2), NET G3 (Ki-67 >20%; mitotic count
>20 in 2 mm2).3,4
According to the most updated data from the Surveillance, Epi-
demiology, and End Results (SEER) programme that analysed 64,971
cases of NEN, there was an age-adjusted annual incidence rate
increase by 6.4-fold from 1973 (1.09 per 100,000) to 2012 (6.98 per
100,000).1 This increase occurred across all NEN, for all sites, stages
and grades. The commonest individual organ with the highest inci-
dence
is
the
lung
(1.49
per
100,000
persons).
Gastro-
entero-pancreatic (GEP) NEN amount to 3.56 per 100,000 popula-
tion and include a variety of primary tumours, the most common
being Si-NEN (1.05 per 100,000 persons). Available data on inci-
dences from national and regional cancer registries in North America,
Western Europe and Japan, identified slight variations across coun-
tries
with
a
trend
toward
slightly
higher
incidence
rate
for
United States, Norway and Sweden compared to United Kingdom,
Italy, Austria and France.5 However, these variations may derive from
heterogeneity of data sources and means of registration rather than
a true variation.5 In a more recent retrospective patient based study
from the United Kingdom the incidence of SI NET was 1.46 per
100,000 in 2018 and equalled the incidence of lung NET.6 Si-NET is
also one of the sites with most pronounced increase of prevalence.
This is most likely due to the indolent disease course of Si-NET with
long overall survival (OS) reported in the SEER database (median OS
of 14 years for Si-NET diagnosed at localised stages and median OS
of 8.6 years for Si-NET with distant metastatic disease).
Most patients have non-functioning tumours with subtle or no
symptoms while around 30% of the patients may present with symp-
toms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS), that may lead to specific symp-
toms
including
diarrhoea,
flushing,
and
more
rarely
bronchial
obstruction induced by hypersecretion of serotonin and other bioac-
tive substances from the tumour. Some patients may develop carci-
noid
heart
disease
(CHD)
as
a
long-term
sequela
of
CS. Comprehensive information on diagnosis and treatment of CS and
CHD are provided in a separate guidance paper.7
This guidance paper provides the current evidence and best
knowledge for the management of Si-NET (predominantly jejunal and
ileal primaries) G1-3 following 10 key questions (Table 1) of practical
relevance for the diagnostic and therapeutic decision making. Grades
of recommendations are provided based on criteria available in

WHICH FEATURES NEED TO BE TAKEN
INTO CONSIDERATION FOR THE
MANAGEMENT OF SI-NET?
Overall, diagnosis and management of Si-NETs requires a specialised
multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach (Figures 1 and 2). Si-NET are
often diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease either inciden-
tally following abdominal imaging for another reason or due to unspe-
cific symptoms associated with metastases, mesenteric fibrosis, or
bowel complaints due to intestinal obstruction. Some patients present
with specific symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) due to secre-
tion of biologically active compounds such as serotonin and tachyki-
nins or are discovered during surgery for intestinal obstruction or
bleeding. Most Si-NET are indolent slow-growing, well -differentiated
NET G1 or G2 and only rarely NET G3. Patients have an excellent 5-
and 10-year survival, even in the metastasised setting.8,9

Risk factors for developing Si-NET remain poorly understood.
The relationship of their development with smoking and gallbladder
diseases has been described.10 There is emerging evidence of the
presence of inherited variants of Si-NET, but the genetic background
of this familial subgroup is still not identified.11 It should also be noted
that Si-NET may coexist with other neoplasms, such as gastrointesti-
nal adenocarcinoma or breast cancer.8,9
From a molecular point of view, relatively few genetic alterations
are found in Si-NET and the landscape is very different from that seen
in Pan-NET.10 50%–78% of Si-NET show loss of chromosome 18, and
about 10% of cases have mutations of the CDKN1B gene, however
without any hotspot mutations in this gene.12,13 Further research is
needed to clarify whether genetic changes might give clues to new
prognostic or predictive factors.
Assessment of symptoms with special focus on CS is crucial. CS
can be the clinical sign leading to the diagnosis of Si-NET. Symptoms
of CS occur when serotonin and other substances (tachykinins, pros-
taglandin and histamine) are secreted directly into the systemic circu-
lation, therefore symptoms of the CS occur in general when NET are
metastasised to the liver. CS not only significantly worsens the quality

of life of Si-NET patients, but it is also associated with CHD in up to
30% of the patients and adversely affects overall survival.14,15
It is important to note that patients suffering from CS are treated dif-
ferently from patients with non-functioning Si-NET. Control of the CS has
a priority before any other procedure to avoid carcinoid crisis7; the main-
stay of treatment of CS is somatostatin analogues (SSA). The majority of
patients however, have non-functioning NET although a transition into a
functioning tumour in the course of the disease or with increasing tumour
burden may occur. If the disease is not resectable, first-line treatment for
most Si-NET patients is SSA. However, some patients with NET G1 and
limited tumour burden may be appropriate for active surveillance.7,16,17
There are variable recommendations regarding the preparation of
Si-NET patients for various medical procedures, including surgery,
peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) or locoregional thera-
pies. It is recommended that in patients with CS, perioperative and
periprocedural use of intravenous SSA is offered to patients regard-
less of the therapy with long-acting SSA.7,16,18,19
A pathognomonic feature on conventional imaging is the typical
mesenteric metastasis, reported in a large series of Si-NET patients in
64% of cases20 where radiating strands of soft tissue can be seen on
CT-scan.21 At pathology, a sclerosing fibrosis around the tumour mass
is often found encompassing vessels and nerves leading to multiple
clinical problems including small intestinal ischaemia, venous conges-
tion, ascites and bowel obstruction.
Recommendations:
Management of Si-NET requires a specialised multidisciplinary team
(MDT) for the complexity of the disease for appropriate diagnostic
and treatment decisions. Specialised centres with high level of
expertise should treat most of these patients, especially in the
advanced setting (RECOMMENDATION A-5). Assessment of
symptoms with special focus on CS is crucial (RECOMMENDATION
A-2b).

IS THERE ANY ROLE OF CIRCULATING
BIOMARKER MEASUREMENT IN SI-NET?
Si-NET may produce and secrete polypeptides and amines, which play an
important role for clinical symptoms related to the CS. These secretory
compounds can also be used to guide diagnosis, follow-up after curative
management and to monitor treatment response of Si-NET. Measuring
such biomarkers at time of first diagnosis and as a baseline assessment at
the time of starting a new treatment is recommended (Figure 2).
Chromogranin A (CgA) is a polypeptide secreted by neuroendo-
crine cells and not specific for Si-NET. The level of CgA in untreated
Si-NET patients can be correlated to tumour burden. Changes during
the initial phase of treatment have in some studies been correlated to
treatment outcome even though this is less well documented.22,23
Risk of false positives should always be considered, especially in the
absence of visible malignancy on imaging. CgA should not be used for
screening of Si-NET, since levels are increased in several non-
malignant diseases such as impaired liver and kidney function, atro-
phic gastritis and inflammatory bowel disease among others. Another
drawback of this biomarker is the existence of different assays with
different cut-off levels. It is therefore important to use the same assay
over time to be able to compare results.
Serotonin is the main amine produced by Si-NET. Measurement
of serotonin in whole blood is not recommended since platelets con-
tain high levels, which influences the results. Instead, the breakdown
product 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) is used and should be
monitored in Si-NET patients.24
5-HIAA has traditionally been measured in acidified urine in two
24 h collections (due to large variations between days) and under diet
restriction since serotonin-rich food may increase the levels signifi-
cantly. Recently, testing of plasma and serum 5-HIAA has been
assessed and compared to urine 5-HIAA,7 and has become increas-
ingly used in the clinic.25 However, impaired kidney function may
influence serum 5-HIAA levels and should be taken into consideration
when interpreting the results.
Tachykinins are small peptides secreted from Si-NET. Circulating
levels correlate to flushing and bronchospasms. However, since only
few laboratories can provide the assay, general measurement is not
recommended.26
In patients with CHD, measurement of N-terminal pro-brain natri-
uretic peptide (NT-ProBNP) is helpful to assess the degree of heart
failure and should be monitored regularly.7,27,28
The NETest® (Wren Laboratories) is an mRNA-based test that
analyses 51 gene transcriptome. It may be used to monitor treatment,
but similarly to CgA it is not specific for Si-NET and the usefulness in
clinical practice is still under evaluation.29 This test is currently not
widely available and its role in ‘real-world’ management as a bio-
marker remains to be determined.
In the few patients with Si-NET G3 it may be of interest to measure
neuron specific enolase (NSE), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), since these biomarkers have shown to be of prog-
nostic value in large cohort studies of G3 NEN patients.30,31 However,
there is very little specific data addressing their importance for Si-NET and
more data is needed to determine their utility in this patient group.
Recommendations:
Circulating biomarkers can be used to guide diagnosis, follow-up after
curative resection and to monitor treatment response of Si-NET
(RECOMMENDATION A-2b).
CgA should not be used for screening of Si-NET
(RECOMMENDATION B-2b), since levels are increased in several
non-malignant diseases with significant number of false positive
results.
5-HIAA, either measured in blood or 24 h urine, should be monitored
in Si-NET patients with suspected CS and to assess treatment
response in patients with CS (RECOMMENDATION A-2a).
In patients with CHD, measurement of NT-ProBNP is helpful to
assess the degree of heart failure and should be monitored regularly
(RECOMMENDATION A-2b).

WHICH IS THE MOST SUITABLE
DIAGNOSTIC AND STAGING WORK-UP FOR
PATIENTS WITH SMALL INTESTINAL NET?
3.1
|
Morphological imaging
Computed tomography (CT) with contrast enhancement is well estab-
lished as the basic morphological imaging method for diagnosis and stag-
ing of patients with Si-NET and should be acquired as a triple-phase CT
scan.32 As an alternative or in combination with CT, contrast enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used; for accurate assess-
ment of liver metastases, this is the preferred imaging method. MRI is
also preferable in young patients with long-term need of follow-up to
reduce irradiation dose. In general, MRI has a better soft-tissue contrast
and is superior to CT in detection of liver lesions as well as bone and brain
metastases.32 Importantly, using conventional MRI small liver metastases
are still missed,33 the addition of diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) raised
sensitivity to 80% compared to all imaging. Furthermore, using hepatos-
pecific contrast agent (Gd EOB-DTPA) raised the sensitivity to 100%
(compared to other nuclear medicine images with positron emission
tomography (PET) such as DOTA-TOC imaging).34
For detection of peritoneal metastases there is no accepted refer-
ence standard. One recent meta-analysis including 24 articles shows
that DWI provided the highest sensitivity for the detection of perito-
neal metastases of gastrointestinal cancer.35 The most useful imaging
tool to identify peritoneal carcinomatosis in NET is the combination
of CT and somatostatin receptor (SST) imaging (SRI).36 Many of the
imaging recommendations rely on availability.
In scenarios where the primary tumour cannot be identified with reg-
ular imaging, CT or MRI enterography may be performed for identification
of an occult bowel primary.37 The use of capsule endoscopy is not gener-
ally recommended, but may be considered in very selected cases.
3.2
|
Somatostatin receptor imaging
SST expression, in particular subtype 2, is present in most Si-NET and
may be visualised using SRI. SRI is nowadays almost entirely based on
positron-emitting radioligands that bind to SST and may be detected
by PET. Currently used PET tracers include 68Ga-DOTATOC, 68Ga-
DOTATATE and 68Ga-DOTANOC (here named 68Ga-SSA-PET) that at
large perform similarly.38 In addition, 64Cu-DOTATATE has recently
been approved and made available in the US and is used on a compas-
sionate use basis in Europe. 64Cu has a longer physical half-life (12.7 h
vs. 1.1 h) and a shorter positron range compared with 68Ga, making
central labelling and distribution of 64Cu-DOTATATE possible and the
shorter position range leads to a better lesion detection rate.39 68Ga-
SSA-PET should be performed as PET/CT or PET/MRI with diagnostic
quality CT or MRI. The use of 68Ga-SSA-PET in Si-NET serves a dual
purpose. Firstly, as the majority of the tumours express SST, 68Ga-
SSA-PET is valuable for diagnostic work-up and staging with a high
sensitivity and lesion detection rate.32 Secondly, non-invasive visuali-
sation of SST expression may help determine whether patients are
suitable candidates for SSA or SST-targeted PRRT with
177Lu-
DOTATATE or other SST targeting compounds. Finally, 68Ga-SSA-
PET may be used for therapy response monitoring.
3.3
|
18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET
FDG is a glucose analogue that is widely used in cancer imaging out-
side NET. It is taken up by the same transporters as glucose but not
further metabolised and thus accumulates in cancer cells. For NET it
has been shown that more aggressive phenotypes (e.g., higher Ki-67
index) have higher 18F-FDG uptake and that 18F-FDG uptake is highly
prognostic across all NEN grades.40 In particular, 18F-FDG PET is also
highly prognostic for G1/G2 NET. A recent prospective study demon-
strated that 39% (35 of 90) of Si-NET were 18F-FDG positive.40 The
same study revealed that across tumour origins, 37% (21 of 57) of G1
NET and 58% (48 of 83) of G2 NET were 18F-FDG positive.40 There-
fore, in addition to the use in high-grade tumours that are negative on
68Ga-SSA-PET, there may be added value when using both 18F-FDG
and 68Ga-SSA-PET more systematically in NET although prospective
studies to document the value are warranted. In patients that are
planned for PRRT, the additional use of 18F-FDG PET to identify mis-
matched lesions, that is, lack of SST on lesions identified on 18F-FDG
PET may be used to identify patients that should be considered for
other or additional treatment. Dual 18F-FDG and SRI could be consid-
ered in G3 Si-NET and selected NET G2 patients (i.e., Ki-67 >10%).
3.4
|
18F-DOPA PET – any role in Si-NET?
When comparing 18F-DOPA with PET based SRI, studies have not been
able to demonstrate any significant advantages. Accordingly, on a lesion
basis
several
studies
have
shown
better
lesion
detection
performance of 68Ga-SSA-PET when compared head-to-head with 18F-
DOPA.41–43 Therefore, although it cannot be ruled out that 18F-DOPA-
may have value in single cases, especially in the rare events of SST neg-
ative Si-NET with low Ki-67, when also considering the availability of
18F-FDG PET, we see no role for 18F-DOPA in Si-NET in general.
A summary of the work up for Si-NETs is provided in Figure 2.
Recommendations:
The initial staging investigation should always be performed using CT
or MRI with contrast enhancement and CT should be acquired as a
triple-phase scan (RECOMMENDATION A-2a).
MRI using contrast (RECOMENDATION A-2a), is the best method for
accurate assessment of liver metastases and in young patients to
reduce radiation dose.
Use of SRI with PET/CT or PET/MRI is recommended in the
diagnostic work-up and staging (RECOMMENDATION B-2a),
selection of patients for PRRT (RECOMMENDATION A-1b) and
therapy monitoring in selected scenarios (RECOMMENDATION
B-2b). In addition, 18F-FDG PET may be valuable for risk stratification
and prior to PRRT in patients with NET G2/ G3
(RECOMMENDATION B-3a). The role of 18F-DOPA, if any, is limited
in Si-NET (RECOMMENDATION C-3b).

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF SURGERY IN
LOCALISED SI-NET?
All localised, resectable Si-NET should be operated, since this is the
only chance for long-term cure given the high rate of lymph node
metastases even in tumours <10 mm. A recent systematic review
showed that the 90-day mortality after surgery for Si-NET is higher in
low-volume centres compared to high-volume hospitals (4% vs. 1%).44
Frequently, patients affected by Si-NET are operated in an emergency
setting due to intestinal occlusion or bleeding in centres with different
levels of expertise, and as consequence with risk for inappropriate
surgical management with regard to lymphadenectomy and re-
section of all NET that are often multiple in the small bowel. There-
fore, it is crucial to refer these patients to dedicated, high-volume
centres, to properly evaluate Si-NET surgery and to plan for an ade-
quate reoperation with vessel- and bowel sparing surgery. In those
rare cases of asymptomatic localised Si-NET that are incidentally dis-
covered, surgery is always the treatment of choice. The extent of
nodal
involvement
and
the
degree
of
mesenteric
fibrosis
(MF) represent the main determinants of surgical resectability. In par-
ticular, the possibility to perform a successful radical resection with
adequate lymphadenectomy is strictly related to the localisation of
superior mesenteric vessel encasement. The definition of surgical
resectability should take especially into account the degree of arterial
involvement by lymph-node metastases according to the classification
of Ohrvall and colleagues.45 In particular, Si-NET with stage III nodal
involvement might be difficult to resect, whereas Si-NET with stage
0, I, or II nodal involvement are generally considered resectable.46
An appropriate surgical resection of Si-NET has to meet specific
criteria, including manual palpation of the entire small intestine and an
adequate lymphadenectomy preserving as much small intestine as
possible. An accurate manual palpation aims to detect multiple syn-
chronous tumours. These tumours are found in 40%–60% of patients
and are usually not detected by the preoperative imaging.45,47 The
aim of surgery is to perform a systematic lymphadenectomy avoiding
a short bowel syndrome. For this reason, the surgical approach should
not be a “pizza pie” approach (including a large intestinal resection),
but a retrograde vessel-sparing lymphadenectomy.45,47 It has been
shown in a recent retrospective study that the resected bowel speci-
men is shortened by about half, when using this technique.47
Si-NET are frequently associated with MF that might cause bowel
obstruction and bowel ischaemia. MF occurs more frequently in male
patients than women and patients affected by MF have a significant
poorer OS compared to those without MF.20 Surgery remains the cor-
nerstone of treatment in patients who report symptoms related to MF
such as abdominal pain or present with bowel obstruction. Nevertheless,
the oncological benefits of surgical resection in patients with MF remain
controversial. A large retrospective series found that patients with MF
and metastatic Si-NET showed no improvement of survival rates after
palliative surgery.20 There may however be a symptomatic benefit.
There are some conflicting results on the minimum number of
lymph nodes to be retrieved during surgery but it seems that ade-
quate lymphadenectomy should include at least 8 lymph nodes for
examination.48 A recent multi-institutional series on surgical treat-
ment of Si-NET of the terminal ileum, found that patients who under-
went formal right hemicolectomy had similar long-term outcomes
compared to those who underwent ileocaecectomy.49 Another single-
centre study showed that right hemicolectomy is a positive prognostic
factor regarding recurrence in localised Si-NET in the distal ileum.50
Figure 3 summarises treatment planning for Si-NET.
The number of metastatic lymph nodes is the main prognostic
factor and determinant of disease recurrence after radical surgery.48
Patients with more than 4 metastatic nodes have a 3-year recurrence
free survival of 80% compared to 90% and 93% in patients with 1–3
and 0 nodal metastases, respectively. 5-years recurrence rates of
30%–40% are reported in retrospective series (e.g., 48, 50). Since the
role of adjuvant therapy, however, has yet not been explored, it is not
indicated outside board approved studies.
A minimally-invasive approach for Si-NET resection has increas-
ingly gained acceptance especially in high-volume centres.51 Laparo-
scopic approach showed similar results in terms of number of resected
lymph nodes and long-term outcomes compared to open approach.51
Nevertheless, minimally-invasive surgery for Si-NET remains controver-
sial, since an open approach has some proposed advantages such as
manual palpation of the entire small intestine, a safer vascular control,
especially when performing a vessel-sparing lymphadenectomy.50 Even
when sometimes small SI-NEN are diagnosed by colonoscopy, endo-
scopic removal should not be performed. Resection of the primary
tumour might not be complete or complicated (e.g., risk of perforation)
and potentially metastatic lymph nodes will not be targeted.
The role of prophylactic cholecystectomy during resection for Si-
NET is another controversial issue. Recently, it has been demon-
strated that on-demand surgery can be considered non-inferior to the
prophylactic cholecystectomy in patients affected by Si-NET.52
Following curative resection, there is no evidence supporting the
use of adjuvant strategies for NET53 and current evidence supports
follow-up only.
Recommendations:
All localised, resectable Si-NET should be operated on using organ-
sparing techniques in high-volume centres (RECOMMENDATION-A-
2b). The surgical gold standard includes an open approach with
bimanual palpation of the entire small intestine and a vessel-sparing
lymphadenectomy (at least >8 lymph nodes) aiming to limit the extent
of small intestine resection (RECOMMENDATION A-2b). Adjuvant
therapy following curative resection for Si-NET is not indicated. The
oncological benefits of surgical resection in patients with MF remain
controversial (RECOMMENDATION C-4).

the results of two placebo-controlled phase 3 trials54,55 (Figure 4). The
PROMID trial included therapy-naïve midgut NET patients, the major-
ity being NET G1 and SST positive although these were not inclusion
criteria. The CLARINET trial included non-functioning SST positive
advanced GEP-NET with a proliferation rate up to a Ki-67 of 10%.56
Nearly all patients had a stable disease at the time of treatment start.
These trials demonstrated significant prolongation of time to progres-
sion and progression free survival (PFS) compared to placebo, respec-
tively, whereas a benefit on OS could not be proven, however the
vast majority of patients crossed over to open label SSA upon pro-
gression on placebo.57 Objective remissions with SSA are rare. No
clear superiority of one SSA over another has been shown.58 Quality
of life is maintained or even improved during treatment.59 It is there-
fore widely accepted that SSA (either lanreotide autogel [AG] or
octreotide long acting release [LAR]) is the preferred first-line treat-
ment in the presence of advanced G1 or G2 (especially if Ki-67 below
10%) Si-NET suitable for systemic therapy. SSA are generally a well-
tolerated treatment except for mostly transient gastrointestinal
(GI) side effects. Patients may develop pancreatic insufficiency with
steatorrhoea, in which case pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy
should be provided.
There are a few scenarios when SSA are not the preferred first-
line treatment:
1. In grade 1, asymptomatic, low tumour burden and stable Si-NET a
watch and wait strategy may be applied delaying start of treatment
with SSA until progression occurs. The CLARINET study showed
anti-proliferative activity of lanreotide AG in patients with progres-
sive disease who crossed over from placebo.60
2. Around 10% of patients with well-differentiated Si-NET do not
show expression of SST. In patients with tumour lesions less than
1 cm in size a SR-PET/CT should be performed (as generally
recommended) to exclude false negative lesions. Although also
receptor-independent mechanisms of SSA effects have been
described, the antiproliferative effect is mediated via binding to
SST.61 Therefore, in patients with SST negative disease other
treatment strategies are needed.
 IFN-α has been used for three decades in Si-NET patients for
antisecretory as well as antiproliferative purposes.62 Prospec-
tive data are mainly available for combination treatment of IFN-
α with octreotide in GEP-NET patients resulting in 6 months
median time to progression in patients with progressive disease
at baseline.63 However, in a large phase 3 study in patients with
“carcinoids” including a mixed patient population of NET G1
and G2 patients with either progressive disease or other poor
prognostic factors including around 36% midgut NET, a median
PFS of 15.4 months was achieved with octreotide LAR and IFN-
α.64 The objective response rate was lower with 4% as com-
pared to older publications.64 Side effects have to be taken into
consideration. The use of IFN-α is limited due to lack of
availability.
 Everolimus is approved for progressive non-functioning Si-NET
based on the results of the RADIANT-4 trial. The percentage of
patients who were treatment naïve (first-line) in this study is

unclear. In patients with gastrointestinal primary the median
PFS was 13.1 months in the everolimus arm compared to
5.4 months in the placebo-arm.65,66 The response rate was 2%
in patients treated with everolimus. Common toxicities include
stomatitis, infections, diabetes, diarrhoea and pneumonitis,
therefore careful follow up investigations and active side effect
management is needed. Although everolimus is an approved
therapy in progressive disease, locoregional therapies could be
considered upfront.
3. The role of SSA in patients with NET G2 and proliferation rate
above 10% is less clear, especially if a rapid progression is docu-
mented or if a high tumour burden is present.56 In these scenarios,
more intense treatments are probably needed. Options of first-line
systemic treatment in this setting may include everolimus, PRRT or
systemic chemotherapy.
 Everolimus may be utilised in this patient group in the presence
of moderate tumour burden and moderate progression (based
on the RADIANT-4 trial).65,66
 The use of upfront PRRT in selected SST positive NET patients
with Ki-67 <10% is not an officially registered therapy but may
be considered particularly in patients with high tumour burden
if enrolment in a clinical trial is not feasible. It remains unclear
which is the best treatment option in NET G2/ G3 patients with
higher proliferation rate. The use of PRRT is supported by the
NETTER-2 study results evaluating 177Lu-DOTATATE versus
high dose octreotide (double standard dose) in patients with
higher proliferating tumours.67 In this phase III study, patients
with newly diagnosed somatostatin receptor-positive NET G2
or G3 (Ki-67 ≥10% and ≤55%) advanced GEP-NETs (29.2% of
small intestine origin) who had been randomised to the 177Lu-
DOTATATE arm showed an improved median PFS (22.8
vs. 8.5 months); stratified HR 0.276 (95% CI 0.182, 0.418;
p < .0001) and overall response rate (43.0% vs. 9.3%). It is
expected that patients represented in the NETTER-2 study are
highly selected (i.e., patients who could have been randomised
to high-dose SSA and therefore not in need of urgent reduction
of tumour burden or other more aggressive therapies). The
issue of the appropriate therapy in NET with Ki-67 from 15% to
55% is currently further investigated in the COMPOSE trial
(PRRT vs. physicians choice, either everolimus or systemic
chemotherapy).
 The best chemotherapy regimen is unclear68 and could include
temozolomide and capecitabine, 5-Fluorouracil-based schedules
such as FOLFOX or combinations of capecitabine with SSA. A
French phase II trial reported favourable results with capecita-
bine in combination with bevacizumab with a median PFS of
23.4 months.69 Altogether, data for use of chemotherapy in Si-
NET is very limited and patients with high Ki-67 should prefer-
entially be considered for clinical trials. Chemotherapy should
only be used in highly selected patients, especially when high
Ki-67, high tumour burden and/ or rapid tumour progression
within 6 months or less is present.
4. NET G3 of small intestinal origin are rare and the best strategy in
patients with advanced disease is unknown. Despite having more
evidence for pancreatic than for Si-NET, most centres use chemo-
therapy with temozolomide in combination with capecitabine or
FOLFOX as a first-line therapy.70,71 This is based on the fact that
adenocarcinoma-like and alkylating-based chemotherapies may be
the most effective treatments in this setting, especially in terms of
response rate and PFS, with etoposide-platinum chemotherapy

showing poor efficacy.71 In carefully selected patients everolimus
could be utilised. In addition, in selected patients with homoge-
neous SST expression PRRT may also be an option.72 The
NETTER-2 study supports the use of PRRT in selected NET G3
(see section above).67 The COMPOSE (NCT04919226) study will
provide more insight into the management of NET G3 with PRRT
as compared to other therapies, such as everolimus, and chemo-
therapy (Temozolomide + Capecitabine or FOLFOX). Patients with
NET G3 should preferentially be included in clinical trials.
Recommendations:
In the presence of advanced unresectable Si-NET G1 or G2 long-
acting SSA (either lanreotide or octreotide) is the preferred first-line
treatment (RECOMMENDATION A-1b). Watch and wait may be an
option in selected patients (G1, asymptomatic, low tumour burden
and/ or stable Si-NET) (RECOMMENDATION B-2b). In patients with
advanced disease and SST negative lesions IFNα
(RECOMMENDATION A-2b) or everolimus (RECOMMENDATION
A-1b) can be used as first-line treatment if locoregional therapy is not
an appropriate option. In patients with advanced intestinal NET G2
with Ki-67 >10% everolimus (RECOMMENDATION A-1b) and PRRT
(RECOMMENDATION A-1b) are treatment options for selected
patients. Chemotherapy has a minor role in highly selected patients
(especially NET G3, and/or rapid tumour progression)
(RECOMMENDATION C-4). Patients with NET G3 should be enrolled
in clinical trials.

WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED
TREATMENT BEYOND FIRST-LINE SSA
THERAPY?
When considering antiproliferative therapy in Si-NET pathological
grade, SST expression, volume of disease, associated symptoms and
comorbidities are key factors (Figure 4). However, clinical trial data and
predictive biomarkers are currently lacking to guide the sequence of
systemic therapy. Overall, following progression on SSA, treatment with
PRRT for patients with SST positive tumour lesions and everolimus for
patients with SST negative lesions are the most likely scenarios. Third-
line therapy following these are more difficult to state and may rely on
prior treatment and specific characteristics at the time of progression,
making discussion in a multidisciplinary team of huge relevance.73 The
presence of CS may impact the choice of treatment for patients with
Si-NET following SSA, this is further discussed in section 8.
6.1

PRRT
In the NETTER-1 phase 3 study patients with advanced progressive
Si-NET were randomised to four cycles of
177Lutetium (177Lu)-
DOTATATE (every 8 weeks) combined with Octreotide LAR 30 mg
every 28 days or high dose Octreotide LAR 60 mg every 4 weeks.
This study showed a significant benefit in terms of PFS for 177Lu-
DOTATATE combined with SSA compared to high-dose SSA with a
hazard ratio 0.21 (p < .001).74 This was associated with a durable ben-
efit (median PFS exceeding 28 months) and improved quality of life
with the most significant benefit seen in global health but also overall
physical and role function. Additionally there were symptomatic bene-
fits for diarrhoea, pain and fatigue in terms of prolonged time to wors-
ening of symptoms as compared to SSA.75 The final analysis of
NETTER-1 performed 5 years after the last patient was enrolled,
reported no additional long-term safety signals with 2% of patients
developing myelodysplastic syndrome.76 Renal side effects may occur
but are usually mild. PRRT is therefore considered the standard
second-line treatment option in the presence of homogenous SST-
positive disease. Major tumour shrinkage is, however, rarely achieved;
the objective response rate in NETTER-1 was 18%. PRRT was fol-
lowed by octreotide LAR at standard dose, however, it is not proven,
that (in the absence of carcinoid syndrome) maintenance therapy with
SSA is superior to just observation after application of PRRT, although
some retrospective data suggest its additional value. Maintenance
therapy with SSA should be given if patients have high tumour
burden.
6.2
|
Rechallenge on PRRT
In view of the significant beneficial outcome of treatment with 177Lu-
DOTATATE and with limited other treatment options, there is a strong
rationale for rechallenge (retreatment) with PRRT in case of persistent
homogenous SST expression. The current consensus is that rechallenge
PRRT may have a role for selected patients and that it could be deliv-
ered outside clinical trials if available. This could be considered espe-
cially if the disease was controlled for at least 9–12 months following
the last cycle of PRRT. If utilised, rechallenge with PRRT would be
delivering two more cycles of PRRT, and this could be repeated again in
the case of progression after another >12 months and if the treatment
was well tolerated.77 In a recent meta-analysis78 the pooled median
PFS in patients initially treated with either 90Y- or 177Lu-PRRT who
were given rechallenge treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE (5 studies,
272 patients) was 12.26 months and the patients who received only
177Lu-DOTATATE had PFS 13.4 months. The median OS in two studies
included in the meta-analysis for rechallenge PRRT was 26.8 months
from the start of retreatment. The safety profile after rechallenge was
similar to initial therapy with grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity
reported in 9% of patients and no patients reported for grade 3 or
4 renal toxicity. Thus rechallenge PRRT appears to be safe and demon-
strates encouraging efficacy for selected patients. Prospective studies
are ongoing to assess its value as compared to alternative treatment
options such as everolimus.

with continuation of standard dose octreotide LAR was more effec-
tive as compared with double standard dose of octreotide LAR in mid-
gut NET patients in the NETTER-1 trial, the median PFS was
8.4 months with octreotide 60 mg/month.74 The CLARINET forte trial
evaluating the efficacy of lanreotide AG 120 mg every 14 days in
patients with progressive Si-NET or Pan-NET following first-line
standard-dose lanreotide AG treatment (120 mg every 28 days)
reported a very similar median PFS of 8.3 months in the midgut
cohort.81 In patients with Ki-67 ≤10% median PFS was 8.6 months.
Median duration of response was 13.8 months. Based on these stud-
ies, above-label SSA is mainly an option in patients with slowly grow-
ing, low proliferative (Ki-67 ≤10%) and/or low tumour burden Si-NET
where a meaningful delay to more toxic treatments can be reached.
The control arm of the NETTER-2 study is challenging this assumption
since a median PFS of 8.5 months was achieved with octreotide
60 mg/ month even in patients with Ki-67 above 10%. High dose SSA
can also be used in patients with comorbidities such as severe renal
insufficiency or impaired bone marrow function in whom PRRT is con-
traindicated or everolimus is not an option.
6.4

Everolimus
Everolimus given orally at 10 mg/day is EMA approved for G1/G2
intestinal, pancreatic and lung NET. Across all NET the overall
response rate (ORR) was <10% and this should be taken into consid-
eration when selecting systemic therapy, as those patients with signif-
icant
symptoms
from
large
volume
disease
may
not
benefit
symptomatically. The RADIANT-4 trial investigated everolimus in
302 GI and lung NET patients. The median PFS was 11 months with
everolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio (HR) 0.48],
with PFS prolongation seen in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56].65 However,
a heterogeneous response was identified on post hoc analysis with
limited benefit identified in indolent Si-NET.66 Everolimus is currently
recommended following PRRT in patients with SST expressing NET
given the good tolerability of PRRT, favourable impact on quality of
life and durable benefit although data from a prospective randomised
trial is still lacking. However, in patients with absent or insufficient
SST expression without CS, everolimus is the treatment of choice in
progressive G1/G2 Si-NET. The ongoing phase III COMPETE trial
(NCT03049189) will compare everolimus to PRRT with
177Lu-
edotreotide and will provide further evidence regarding adequate
sequencing of treatment.
6.5

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are currently not approved in Si-NET
in Europe but could be an option for patients with Si-NET with low or
no SST expression or after failure to established standard therapies.
Several phase II trials with TKIs including cabozantinib, lenvatinib,
pazopanib and axitinib have demonstrated some efficacy in Si-
NET.82–88 Axitinib and octreotide LAR demonstrated a prolongation
of median PFS compared to placebo and octreotide LAR in central
review of a randomised phase III trial in patients with extra-pancreatic
NET (however failed to reach significant results in local radiological
analysis what was the primary endpoint of the trial). The activity of
cabozantinib has been confirmed in a randomised placebo-controlled
phase III study, that showed prolongation of PFS with decisions
regarding approval for this indication still pending.89 If accessible, a
TKI may be considered (outside clinical trial setting) after failure of
standard therapies (before chemotherapy) or in SST negative patients
in case of intolerance to everolimus or IFN-α, or after failure of these
therapies.
6.6
|
Chemotherapy
Efficacy of systemic chemotherapy in G1/G2 Si-NET is poor with
ORR of 11.5% (range 5.8%–17.2%).68 However, in very selected cases
of NET G2 with a higher Ki-67 (15%–20%) or in NET G3, in case of
rapid clinical or radiological progression or where any aspects exclude
other treatment options chemotherapy can be beneficial. When doing
so, temozolomide and capecitabine or FOLFOX are the recommended
schedules to use. Assessment of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase
(DPD) testing to identify DPD deficiency (associated with poor
metabolism of 5-FU or capecitabine) is recommended if these drugs
are used; with dose adjustment if DPD deficiency is identified.
Recommendations:
The recommended second-line treatment in the presence of SST-
positive Si-NET is PRRT (RECOMMENDATION A-1b), followed by
everolimus (RECOMMENDATION A-1b). Rechallenge PPRT
(RECOMMENDATION C-4) and high dose SSA
(RECOMMENDATION B-2) may be considered in selected scenarios.
TKI may be considered based on accessibility and reimbursement
after failure to approved therapies or in SST negative NET
(RECOMMENDATION C-2b). Chemotherapy is rarely recommended
for Si-NET unless NET G2 with higher Ki-67 (15%–20%) or NET G3,
with rapid tumour progression (RECOMMENDATION C-3).

WHAT IS THE ROLE OF
LOCOREGIONAL AND ABLATIVE THERAPIES
IN ADVANCED SI-NET?
For Si-NET patients with resectable G1/G2 liver metastases without
extrahepatic tumour spread identified after thorough work-up (includ-
ing MRI as well as functional imaging) and with no significant comor-
bidities, a curative surgical approach is the treatment of choice. This is
supported by large series reporting favourable 5-year OS rates of
71%–74%90,91 and 85% for all resected and R0 resected patients,92
respectively. For Si-NET, there is no established cut-off value for Ki-
67 to exclude patients from surgery of resectable liver metastases.
However, it has been shown in a retrospective study that the PFS is
about half in patients with G3 liver metastases compared to G1/G2

metastases.93 Therefore, surgery for Si-NET G3 patients with poten-
tially resectable single or few liver metastases should be discussed
critically in the MDT. Furthermore, the recurrence rate after R0 re-
section for G1/G2 tumours, is high (about 80% in 5 years) and there-
fore a follow-up strategy is needed.90 The same is true for patients
with resectable liver metastases of NET G1/G2 with unknown pri-
mary. In patients with not completely resectable liver metastases
and/or unresectable extrahepatic metastatic disease debulking sur-
gery might be considered after MDT discussion in case of functional
NET (carcinoid syndrome) or local liver problems such as bile duct
obstruction caused by the metastases.
For patients with G1/G2 Si-NET with predominant liver metasta-
ses who are not surgical candidates due to either performance status or
extent of liver disease, liver-directed therapies such as radiofrequency
ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), irreversible electroporation
(IRE), transarterial embolization (TAE), or chemoembolization (TACE)
and radioembolization (TARE), can be applied to provide local tumour
control and improve symptoms of CS.94–96 The details of advantages
and disadvantages of the distinct techniques are beyond the scope of
this guidance paper and high-quality evidence supporting one treat-
ment approach over another as well as for the optimal treatment
sequencing is still very limited. Centres are encouraged to take into
account the treatment options in which they have most experience on
at the time of decision making. From a clinical point of view, percutane-
ous ablation techniques (RFA, MWA, IRE) are the treatments of choice
in patients with oligometastatic disease (preferably maximum of 3–5
metastases and <3 cm in size) or oligoprogressive disease (1 or 2 metas-
tases not responding to systemic treatment). It has been reported that
in patients who underwent locoregional treatment for focal liver pro-
gression, the median time to new systemic therapy was 32 months.97
Larger size, hilar location, and the proximity to major bile ducts can
increase the risk of complications, while proximity to large vessels can
result in a cooling effect reducing its effectiveness. For patients with
metastases >3 cm, aforementioned risk factors for ablation or with mul-
tifocal uni- or bilobular disease, transarterial therapies such as TAE,
TACE or TARE are usually indicated. Few studies have compared differ-
ent transarterial strategies. A recent retrospective study noted no dif-
ference between TACE and TARE regarding PFS and OS rates.98 An
ongoing randomised controlled trial comparing TAE, TACE and drug-
eluting beads (DEB)-TACE had to close the DEB-TACE arm due to
increased severe complications.99 Based on the limited high-quality
data, MDT decisions regarding liver-directed therapies are significantly
influenced by institutional preferences and local experience of distinct
techniques.20,95
Palliative resection of the primary Si-NET in patients with
advanced disease is also a matter of debate. Surgical resection or
intestinal bypass are mandatory in the presence of primary-related
complications such as intestinal obstruction, ischaemia or haemor-
rhage. The advantage of prophylactic surgery in asymptomatic
patients affected by Si-NET is more controversial. Several retrospec-
tive studies have been performed.100 Most of these studies lack
important information, such as the burden of metastatic disease, the
cause of unresectable tumours, and the use and the type of associated
systemic therapies. Moreover, palliative surgical resection has most
probably been offered more frequently to patients with better perfor-
mance status and less aggressive disease. Given this high-risk of bias,
primary tumour resection is seemingly associated with a benefit in
terms of survival compared to no resection.101,102 However, there are
at least three studies that have tried to remove selection bias by using
propensity-score matching, and these studies show no benefit in
terms of survival.20,103,104 Regarding timing of prophylactic surgery,
the need of an upfront surgical approach in patients with asymptom-
atic stage IV Si-NET, has been challenged by a large retrospective
study.103 In this study only 22% of patients in the surgery as needed
group had to undergo surgery during follow-up. Delayed locoregional
surgery (>6 months from diagnosis) in patients with advanced Si-NET
is associated with similar overall and disease-specific survival com-
pared to surgery performed within 6 months from initial diagnosis.103
Two recent retrospective studies105,106 have shown that the combina-
tion of Si-NET resection and PRRT provides the best disease-specific
survival for patients with diffuse stage IV disease, especially if the
metastatic liver burden is less than 50%.106 At present the question is
open and its firm answer requires a prospective controlled trial. Thus,
benefit and risk of the primary tumour resection in asymptomatic
patients with unresectable stage IV disease should be discussed with
the patient and in the MDT. A rare consideration could be resection of
the primary tumour to leave a patient with liver only disease and the
consideration
in
selected
individuals
for
orthotopic
liver
transplantation.
Cytoreduction for Si-NET with peritoneal carcinomatosis has
been demonstrated to be effective with acceptable morbidity and
mortality rates in selected patients.107 In a recent retrospective analy-
sis of 98 patients, Si-NET patients without liver metastases and only
localised peritoneal carcinomatosis in one abdominal quadrant with
lesions <5 mm benefit the most. Their OS was 76 months compared
to 32 months in patients with diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis and
lesions >5 mm.107 Thus, Si-NET patients with or without resectable
liver metastases with limited peritoneal carcinomatosis are good can-
didates for cytoreductive surgery.84 The role of hyperthermic intra-
peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in addition to cytoreduction in
patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis has been retrospectively
explored in Si-NET.108 Based on these results it cannot be recom-
mended for patients with Si-NET and peritoneal carcinomatosis at
present.
Recommendations:
In patients with Si-NET G1/G2 stage IV disease and exclusive liver
metastases a surgical approach is indicated, if R0 resection can be
achieved (Recommendation B-4). In non-surgical candidates
locoregional liver-directed therapies should be explored in
predominant liver disease to control tumour growth, CS and
oligometastatic progression (Recommendation B-3). Cytoreductive
peritoneal surgery is recommended in patients with localised
peritoneal carcinomatosis (Recommendation A-4). Benefit and risk of
a primary tumour resection in asymptomatic patients with
unresectable stage IV disease should be discussed critically with the
patient and in the MDT.

WHICH IS THE BEST THERAPEUTIC
STRATEGY IN PATIENTS WITH CARCINOID
SYNDROME FOR SYNDROME AND TUMOUR
GROWTH CONTROL?
Refractory
CS
(especially
with
worsening
bowel
movements
(BM) or flushing) may be a challenging scenario faced by clinicians
treating NET. Refractory CS has recently been defined by ENETS
as “recurring or persisting CS symptoms and increasing or persis-
tently high u5-HIAA levels despite the use of standard doses of
SSA”. Refractory CS is classified as “non-aggressive or aggressive”,
based on symptom burden together with disease status (stable or
progressive),
hepatic
tumour
burden,
and/or
the
presence
of CHD.7
In
the
presence
of
CS,
the
recommendations
for
anti-
proliferative therapy as outlined above (see Q6) may not be appli-
cable,
and
alternative
approaches
(i.e.,
early
liver
directed
therapies) may be considered. The requirements for treatment
may also be different since patients may suffer from increasing
symptoms but may not necessarily display obvious tumour growth.
It is of crucial importance to determine the treatment goals first,
either improvement of CS symptoms, tumour growth control
or both.
8.1

Aiming for symptom control
In the scenario of refractory CS on SSA without evidence of disease
progression, the aim of the treatment should focus on achieving an
antisecretory effect.
High dose of SSA can be considered7 and has often been applied
in clinical routine. It is supported by retrospective analyses but there
is a lack of high quality data or evidence based randomised controlled
trials.56 High dose SSA implies above labelled dose that can either be
reached by shortening of the injection interval or by increasing the
dose and maintaining the standard interval of 28 days. In retrospec-
tive trials symptomatic improvement for diarrhoea is reported in up to
79%109 and for flushing in up to 91% of patients.110 The only pro-
spective randomised trial in patients with refractory CS compared an
above label dose of octreotide LAR (40 mg) with pasireotide LAR
60 mg (a universal ligand to SST) every 28 days111 and reported symp-
tom control in 27% and 21% of patients, respectively. Based on these
data high dose of SSA can be used for symptom control in
refractory CS.
Addition of short acting octreotide s.c. to depot preparations
of SSA as rescue therapy for breakthrough symptoms may also be
an
option.112,113
Pasireotide
may
be
considered
off-label
in
patients
suffering
from
CS
when
other
options
have
been
exploited.
Telotristat ethyl, an oral inhibitor of the serotonin synthesis,
significantly reduced diarrhoea and 5-HIAA levels in patients
with refractory CS in two randomised placebo-controlled tri-
als.107,108 Flushing was not significantly improved as expected
since it is related to secretion of other bioactive compounds than
serotonin.
The
drug
was
generally
well-tolerated,
treatment
related adverse events included nausea, abdominal pain and ele-
vation of gamma-glutamyl transferase.114 Addition of telotristat
ethyl to SSA is recommended in CS patients with refractory
diarrhoea.
The use of liver directed therapies for poorly controlled CS
should be considered upfront. In addition to debulking surgery,
locoregional treatments can achieve symptomatic as well as tumour
response. Evidence from prospective controlled trials is lacking. A
recent review including more than 100 mainly retrospective studies
and 5000 patients reported a symptomatic response in 55.2%.95
Outcome did not significantly vary depending on the type of embo-
lization performed with a tendency for better symptomatic and
tumour size response after radioembolization. However, radioembo-
lization should be used with caution in patients with Si-NET given
the risk of long-term sequelae including liver fibrosis and cirrhosis,
particularly in low grade Si-NET who may have a long life expec-
tancy exceeding 8 years. In general, bland embolization is usually
preferred. In patients with persisting symptoms of CS despite SSA
treatment, locoregional treatment of liver metastases should be dis-
cussed early in the MDT.
IFN-α is an approved antisecretory treatment for patients with
CS and may alleviate not only diarrhoea but also flushing. Due to
more side effects compared to SSA, it is usually used as an add-on
option in patients with refractory CS or upfront in SST negative
NET patients. Symptomatic response was reported in 50%–70% of
patients.62,115 The recommended dose is 3–5 MU/week, an off-label
pegylated formulation once weekly may be better tolerated,116 but
availability is limited due to discontinued production of some
compounds.
PRRT is mainly used for its antiproliferative effects based on
the results of the NETTER-1 trial and its labelled indication in pro-
gressive disease (see Q6).74 The proportion of patients suffering
from CS symptoms on PRRT plus standard dose of octreotide ver-
sus high dose octreotide was the same. However, in NETTER-1
the median time to deterioration (TTD) of diarrhoea in a subset of
patients with CS was significantly longer with PRRT and standard
dose of octreotide LAR as compared to high-dose octreotide
(p = .0107), whereas TTD for flushing was not significantly differ-
ent when comparing treatment arms.75 A small retrospective
monocentric study reported efficacy in refractory CS patients with-
out documented disease progression; number of bowel movements
as well as frequency of flushing episodes were reduced after PRRT
with
177Lu-DOTATATE.117 In highly symptomatic patients, how-
ever, symptom control is crucial before PRRT, and withdrawal of
long-acting SSA prior to PRRT may lead to worsening of diarrhoea
(eventually associated with renal insufficiency). Therefore, other
options should be considered upfront for improvement of symp-
toms. Caution is also required in patients with CHD, where com-
pensation of heart insufficiency may be required first and an
experienced cardiologist should be consulted, (see separate guid-
ance paper on CHD).7

Everolimus plays a minor, if any role in patients where syndrome
control is the goal. However, in the RADIANT-2 study, everolimus
plus octreotide LAR resulted in greater reductions of urinary 5-HIAA
compared with placebo plus octreotide LAR, but the efficacy on
symptom control was not reported in this trial.118 Reduction of
5-HIAA was sustainable and since reduction of 5-HIAA usually is asso-
ciated with symptom improvement, an (off label) addition of everoli-
mus may be considered in patients with CS, particularly if there is
progressive disease and an antiproliferative therapy is warranted. A
benefit on symptoms is also supported by a small retrospective study
reporting symptom control in 7 of 10 patients with the addition of
everolimus to SSA.119 Patients should be controlled for development
of
hyperglycaemia
or
diabetes
when
everolimus
is
combined
with SSA.

Aiming for antiproliferative effect
In the presence of CS and evidence of disease progression, manage-
ment may be complex since not all treatments with an antisecretory
effect have proven anticancer effect (i.e., telotristat ethyl) and also
because some treatments have not shown definitive activity in the
presence of CS (i.e., everolimus).118
IFN-α, if available may be a preferred therapy in these patients
because it also exerts antiproliferative effects. In addition to symp-
tomatic response (see above) tumour control was reported with a
median PFS of 15.4 months and a response rate of 4% when com-
bined with SSA.64
The use of high-dose SSA is supported by the CLARINET forte
study and the control arm of NETTER-1 study in patients with Ki-67
<10%. In patients with comorbidities, elderly patients or patients with
indolent tumour growth, this may be an alternative approach when
more aggressive therapies seem inappropriate or growth is slow over
several years.
In the RADIANT-2 phase 3 trial, the primary endpoint PFS
by central reading narrowly missed the prespecified threshold of
significance (p = .026). Therefore, everolimus is not registered
for patients with a history of CS. It may be considered in
patients with significant growth when other options have been
exploited
(such
as
high
dose
SSA,
locoregional
therapies
and PRRT).
PRRT is regarded as the standard antiproliferative second line
treatment for metastatic and progressive SST positive Si-NET (see
Q6). This treatment was more effective than high dose octreotide in
patients regardless of the presence of carcinoid syndrome. PRRT is a
good treatment option in patients with progressive disease especially
if extrahepatic metastases are present. In liver predominant disease
embolization treatment can induce fast symptomatic response and
high radiological response rates (the objective response rate of pooled
data in a recent review was 36.6%).95 In the presence of CS even a
higher symptomatic response rate was seen (70%).7 PRRT can be
recommended as preferred option although evidence from prospec-
tive controlled trials is not available.
Recommendations:
In patients with CS, a multidisciplinary approach is of crucial
importance.
In patients with refractory CS and predominant diarrhoea, telotristat
ethyl should be added to SSA (Recommendation A-1a). SSA dose
escalation can be considered in patients with refractory CS
(Recommendation A-3b) or alternatively addition of IFN-α
(Recommendation B-2b). Locoregional and ablative treatments
including debulking surgery, should be considered early for refractory
CS (Recommendation B-3a). PRRT represents an option
(Recommendation B-3b), especially if progressive metastatic disease is
present. Everolimus may be considered in individual patients in
combination with SSA if significant tumour growth is present after
exploitation of other options (Recommendation C-4).

WHAT ARE THE MOST RECENT
DEVELOPMENTS FOR SI-NET?
9.1
|
Molecular profiling and precision medicine
Despite molecular profiling being widely explored in Si-NET, precision
medicine strategies in this patient population are scarce and remain
investigational120 due to lack of specific mutations and rather pres-
ence of epigenetic alterations. Routine genomic profiling of tumour
tissue is not recommended, but might be considered in patients with
Si-NET (if available and reimbursed) when all treatment options have
been exploited, but it is important to manage patients' expectations
regarding the very low likelihood of the results impacting their treat-
ment options.120
9.2
|
Latest developments on systemic treatments
for Si-NET: targeting angiogenesis
Regarding new systemic therapy options for Si-NET, multiple clinical
trials have been reported over the last few years related to antiangio-
genic tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with promising results. How-
ever, only sunitinib is registered in Europe for Pan-NET so far.121 Si-
NET patients were not included in the pivotal phase 3 clinical trial
with sunitinib, and thus the field was unexplored for some time, until
the recent years when a variety of TKIs have been studied in phase II
and III clinical trials including Si-NET.
Some of the TKIs that have been explored in this setting include
lenvatinib,84 surufatinib,87,122 axitinib88,123 and pazopanib.124 How-
ever, these compounds are not yet registered for NET in Europe.
Cabozantinib is an emerging drug in this field. A phase II study with
cabozantinib included a cohort of 41 heavily pretreated Si-NET
patients.125 In this study the primary endpoint was ORR. Achieved
ORR in the Si-NET cohort was 15%, with 26/41 patients having dis-
ease stabilisation. Median PFS was 31.4 months (95% CI 8.5-not
reached).
The
CABINET
phase
III
clinical
trial
data
including
197 patients with extra-pancreatic NETs (129 randomised on cabo-
zantinib and 68 on placebo) supports the activity of cabozantinib with
LAMARCA ET AL.

improvement of PFS (HR 0.41; p-value <.0001).89 Data from the sub-
group analysis in intestinal NET are still lacking.
Based on the study results, TKI preferably cabozantinib in view of
the positive phase III trial but also lenvatinib (based on results from an
uncontrolled phase 2 study with ORR 16.4% and mPFS 15.7 months
in GI-NET patients) may be considered in patients in whom all treat-
ment options have been exploited if available and reimbursed and no
clinical trial available. TKI may also be a consideration in SST negative
patients.
9.3
|
Immunotherapy
Immunotherapy approaches in Si-NET have been disappointing. PD-
L1 expression within tumour cells has been described to be present in
12.8% of Si-NET.126 Monotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI)
has not shown much activity, regardless of expression of PD-L1 or
other potential biomarkers linked to immunotherapy activity.127–129
Combination strategies of dual CPI such as durvalumab and tremeli-
mumab (DUNE study) have been explored but no objective responses
have been reported in the Si-NET group neither.130 Despite this, the
field is evolving and alternative combinations of immunotherapy and
antiangiogenic compounds (i.e., atezolizumab and bevacizumab) look
more promising (objective response rate of 15% in the extra-
pancreatic
NET
cohort
with
durable
benefit
[median
PFS
14.9 months]).131 Novel approaches such as CAR-T cells are in pre-
clinical
stage132;
combination
of
CPI
with
TKIs
are
under
development.
Outside the setting of mismatch repair deficiency, microsatellite
instability or high TMB, that is rather seen in poorly differentiated
NEC than in well differentiated NET, immunotherapy for Si-NET can-
not be recommended based on the current evidence. It remains inves-
tigational and patients should be included in clinical trials.
Recommendations:
After failure to standard therapies, novel TKIs (RECOMMENDATION
B-2b) could be considered if available, while immunotherapy has
currently no place in the management of Si-NET, and strategies in this
setting remain investigational (RECOMMENDATION C-2b). Patients
diagnosed with Si-NET who failed available treatment options should
be considered for participation in clinical trials.

WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED
FOLLOW-UP FOR SI-NET?
10.1
|
Imaging follow-up after surgery: curative
setting
No prospective studies are available regarding the timing of follow-up
and the imaging modalities to be utilised in patients who have had
potentially curative resection for Si-NET. Follow-up should last for a
long time (it may be required to be life-long) after resection since dis-
ease relapse can occur also 15 years after surgery.133,134 MRI of the
liver can be offered as the preferred imaging modality of follow-up for
its accuracy in detecting liver metastases as the most frequent site of
distant metastasis and the advantage of not exposing patients to
ionising radiation. Staging intervals range between 3 and 12 months
depending on extent of disease, grade, and length of follow-up. We
recommend imaging 3–6 months after surgery, followed by 6 months
intervals in NET G1, and closer intervals in NET G2. Recurrence most
frequently occurs within the first 5 years after curative surgery. After
5 years of being tumour-free, staging intervals may be prolonged to
1 year.135 In patients with advanced disease (loco-regional LN
involved, liver metastases), SRI is recommended after surgery within
3–6 months, and should be repeated in long-term follow up (after
3 years or if suspicious findings on conventional imaging or clinical
examination).
10.2
|
Imaging follow-up: palliative setting
Frequency of follow-up during palliative treatment depend on clinical
factors (more frequent follow-up in rapidly progressing tumours or G2
Si-NET) as well as the treatment administered. Follow-up should be
performed in the form of CT or MRI with higher sensitivity for visuali-
sation of liver metastases with MRI. After a first assessment at
3 months from starting a new treatment, imaging every 6 months for
G1 Si-NET, treated with SSA may be acceptable. In contrast, patients
on everolimus, IFN-α, TKI and chemotherapy require imaging every
3 months as established in oncological practice. Follow-up on patients
receiving PRRT should be performed first after 3–4 months from the
first cycle of PRRT, since around 20% do not respond to PRRT.
The rare event of pseudoprogression should be kept in mind and SRI
with PET/CT should be interpreted in the context of clinical and bio-
chemical findings. Further re-evaluation intervals may range between
3 and 6 months depending on grade (3 months in higher NET G2 and
NET G3). SRI may be recommended if clinically indicated or every 1–
3 years depending on disease spread/sites (lung, bone involvement,
peritoneal carcinomatosis, diffuse LN metastases).
Staging intervals with conventional imaging should be every
3 months in NET G3 irrespective of type of treatment. An 18F-FDG-
PET may be required to visualise bone metastases or other distant
metastases if there is no uptake on SRI or if PRRT is a treatment
option.
Bone MRI may be required if symptoms occur indicating bone
lesions.
10.3
|
Biomarker follow-up
Assessment of circulating biomarkers such as CgA, and NSE (in NET
G3) and 5-HIAA; see Question 2) at the time of first diagnosis and as
a baseline assessment at the time of starting a new treatment is
recommended.

reassessment (every 3–6 months depending on the characteristics of
the NET and the treatment being monitored) along with imaging could
be of use, particularly to inform about the need to expand imaging to
other regions than the abdomen. In long-term follow-up circulating
biomarkers, if informative in the individual patient (elevated in
patients with measurable disease on imaging) may be used alternating
with imaging and prompting to additional diagnostic work-up in case
of significant increase.
Recommendations:
All patients should be followed-up long-term after curative surgery
(RECOMMENDATION A-4) preferably using MRI of the liver/
abdomen (RECOMMENDATION C-5). Assessment of circulating
biomarkers at time of first diagnosis, and as a baseline assessment at
the time of starting a new treatment is recommended
(RECOMMENDATION B-4). Radiological and biomarker follow-up
during palliative treatment depends on clinical factors, grading, and
the type of treatment being administered. (RECOMMENDATION
B-5).

CONCLUSION
Management of Si-NET requires a multidisciplinary approach and
referral to centres with adequate expertise. Accurate diagnosis
and staging are crucial for proper treatment planning. Exploration of
(epi)genetics, novel circulating biomarkers and improved radiology and
nuclear medicine tools are ongoing areas of research in the field. Cur-
rent management, especially in the setting of systemic therapies, relies
on robust scientific evidence based on prospective clinical trials.
Treatment options are still limited, but are expanding with novel TKIs
and novel radiopeptides under development while immunotherapy
has no role and novel approaches remain investigational. The most
adequate sequence of therapies has still to be clarified. In the context
of precision medicine the development of predictive biomarkers for
tailored treatment planning is crucial.
