NE-H 5 of 12
• First column: 
New header added: Favorable Biology (eg, relatively low Ki-67 [<55%], slow growing, positive SSTR-based PET imaging).
Sub-header revised: Locally Advanced/Metastatic Disease with Favorable Biology (Unresectable with Clinically Significant Tumor Burden or Evidence 
of Disease Progression).
• Second column:
New header added: Unfavorable Biology (eg, relatively high Ki-67 [≥55%], faster growing, negative SSTR-based PET imaging).
Sub-headers revised:
 ◊Locoregional Disease (Resectable) with Unfavorable Biology.
 ◊Locally Advanced/Metastatic Disease with Unfavorable Biology.
• New footnote m added: There are limitations in terms of the data for what the appropriate cutoff should be, as well as variability/heterogeneity of Ki-
67 in a given tumor and over time in serial biopsies. The clinical course can be heterogeneous and treatment considerations need to account for both 
pathologic and clinical features.
• Footnote removed: Consider trial of SSA before PRRT. Preliminary data suggest reduced efficacy if high Ki-67 and/or FDG-PET avid.
NE-H 7 of 12
• Footnotes revised:
Footnote s: Entrectinib and, larotrectinib, and repotrectinib can be considered for patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive tumors without a known 
acquired resistance mutation, that are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and that have no satisfactory 
alternative treatments or that have progressed following treatment.
Footnote t: Repotrectinib can also be considered for patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive tumors that progressed on a prior NTRK-targeted 
treatment.
NE-H 8 of 12
• Other Recommended Regimens, new option added: Cabozantinib
• Useful in Certain Circumstances:
New options added:
 ◊Nivolumab + ipilimumab
 ◊Osilodrostat (for symptom control)
Option removed: None
• Footnote p added to this page: Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is not approved for concurrent use with IV ipilimumab; however, for nivolumab 
monotherapy, nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV nivolumab. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy has 
different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV nivolumab.
• New footnote y added: Studies have demonstrated efficacy in the setting of cortisol excess in states like adrenal adenomas, adrenal carcinomas, and 
ectopic ACTH syndrome.

b Multiphasic imaging studies are performed with IV contrast in arterial and portal venous phases.
c SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI of skull vertex to mid-thigh with multiphase IV contrast when possible. Data are limited on the optimal timing of scans following

d SSTR-PET tracers (eg, 68Ga-DOTATATE, 64Cu-DOTATATE, and 68Ga-DOTATOC).
p  May need multiple biopsies throughout the entire stomach.
q Serum gastrin can be falsely elevated with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. To confirm diagnosis, it should ideally be checked when fasting and off PPI for >1 week. 
However, PPI should be continued in patients with overt clinical symptoms of gastrinoma and/or risks of complications.
r Elevated gastrin levels are usually suggestive of type 1 or type 2 tumors.
s For rare, >2 cm, type 1 gastric tumors, workup should include multiphasic CT or MRI of the abdomen. For metastatic disease, see NET-12.
t Type 3 gNETs are sporadic and unifocal.
u There is increasing evidence that patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy may be at an increased risk of developing gastric NETs (gNETs), which appear to 
have a much lower propensity to metastasize than sporadic type 3 tumors.
v Hirasawa T, et al. Dig Endosc 2021;33:408-417.
w Endoscopic resection should be reserved for small (<1 cm), superficial, low-grade tumors.

ff For patients with insulinoma, octreotide LAR or lanreotide should be used only if SSTR-based imaging 
is positive. If used, they should be used with caution in patients with insulinoma as they may transiently 
worsen hypoglycemia (see Discussion for details).

Rule out PCC (NE-E 2 of 4) 
e False negatives are possible; may consider proceeding directly to surgery in selected cases. 
f Adrenal vein sampling can be considered for distinguishing single unilateral adenomas from bilateral hyperplasia. CT imaging is not always reliable. Some NCCN 
Member Institutions recommend sampling in all cases of primary aldosteronism. However, it may be reasonable to exclude adrenal vein sampling in patients <40 
years. Cortisol measurement in the catheterization samples is used to confirm proper catheter placement.

b Consider medical alert ID for hormonally secreting PCCs and PGLs in situ or metastatic 
disease.
c Review concurrent medication(s) for those that may interfere with plasma metanephrines 
evaluation. Elevations that are 3 times above the upper limit of normal are diagnostic. 
d For cervical PGL, measuring serum and/or 24-hour urine fractionated catecholamines 
(for dopamine) or methoxytyramine (if available) may be appropriate. Methoxytyramine 
is helpful as the metabolite of dopamine in cervical tumors but it is not commercially 
available in many places.
e Both catecholamines and metanephrines/normetanephrines can represent false-positive 
results. Some investigators support the use of fractionated urinary and/or plasma 
catecholamines as a way to differentiate false-positive results and to differentiate 
epinephrine-secreting PCC. 
f Data on the role of functional imaging in PCC/PGL are evolving and the preferred 
method remains unclear.
g Multiphasic imaging studies are performed with IV contrast in arterial and portal venous 
phases.

j MIBG scans are less sensitive than FDG-PET and 68Ga-DOTATATE for 
metastatic and multifocal PCCs/PGLs (in patients with von Hippel Lindau 
[VHL] and succinate dehydrogenase [SDH] syndromes but not patients

k Tumor/somatic molecular profiling should be considered for patients

Nonselective alpha blockade phentolamine (IV) can be used intraoperatively. Doxazosin has a longer half-life 
and is oftentimes more available than some of the other agents.
o Alpha blockade is necessary treatment for all hormonally secreting PCCs and PGLs regardless of clinical 
symptoms. If additional treatments are planned, patients may need medication adjustments. After alpha 
blockade, if additional blood pressure support is needed, the addition of dihydropyridine calcium channel 
blockers can be used. This is not recommended as monotherapy unless the patient cannot tolerate alpha 
blockade. Metyrosine can also be used in addition to alpha blockade to stabilize blood pressure. Beta blockade 
can be added to alpha blockade for tachycardia. B1 selective blockers or nonselective beta blockers can be 
used. Combination beta/alpha blockers are not recommended.

Discussion
• In general, surgical treatment of patients with MEN1 is similar to those with sporadic tumors. Refer to the relevant site-specific 
recommendations for PanNETs earlier in these guidelines (PanNET-1 through PanNET-10).
• However, one notable exception is the multifocality of pancreatoduodenal NETs in patients with MEN1. The role of surgery remains 
controversial in patients with multifocal tumors.
• Decision to resect a pancreatic or duodenal NET in the setting of multifocal disease is complex. If surgery is performed to resect hormonally 
functional tumor(s), attempts should be made to preoperatively localize the site of the functional tumor. Surgical resection can be 
considered in the following scenarios:
Symptomatic functional tumors refractory to medical management
Tumor >2 cm in size
Tumor with relatively rapid rate of growth over 6–12 months 
• Endoscopy with EUS is recommended prior to pancreatic surgery in order to preoperatively assess and localize tumors.
• MEN1-associated metastatic PanNETs are often slower growing than metastatic sporadic tumors. Observation can be considered for non-
functioning indolent tumors.

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF NEUROENDOCRINE NEOPLASMS1
Required Information:
• Diagnosis and differentiation:
Broad-spectrum keratin marker (to distinguish PCC/PGL)
2 of 3 immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers (synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and INSM1)
In cases of mixed neuroendocrine neoplasms (with the smaller tumor component at least 30% of the total tumor mass), each component 
must be diagnosed and graded based on AJCC tumor nomenclature and following the criteria of tumor differentiation.
• Grade (for well-differentiated NETs):
Ki-67 proliferative index (preferred, unless there is insufficient tissue) and/or mitotic rate
• Site of origin:
Clinical (including radiologic/endoscopic) information is used to determine if it is primary or metastatic, and if metastatic, the possible site 
of primary. 
• For resected specimens (surgical/endoscopic):
Tumor foci (unifocal/presence of multicentric disease)
Tumor size and extent (tumor node metastasis [TNM] stage per the AJCC TNM system [ST-1])
Presence of lymphovascular invasion
Presence of perineural invasion
Margin status (report as positive or negative)
Lymph node status (including presence and size of mesenteric masses in gross report for jejunal and ileal NETs) (ST-1)
 ◊Include the number of positive nodes and total number of nodes examined
• Background mucosal pathology for clinicopathologic subtyping of gastric NETs (gNETs):
Secondary: Arising in gastric body mucosa linked to an underlying etiology:
 ◊Type 1: Hypergastrinemia with histologic evidence of background atrophy (either autoimmune or chronic H. pylori infection) associated 
with enterochromaffin-like (ECL)-cell hyperplasia.
 ◊Type 2: Hypergastrinemia from underlying gastrinoma with histologic evidence of parietal cell hyperplasia and ECL-cell hyperplasia.
 ◊Other: Hypergastrinemia (other than type 2) without evidence of underlying gastrinoma but with histologic evidence of parietal cell 
hyperplasia and ECL-cell hyperplasia, consider PPI-associated gNET.2 Other rare causes include insufficient proton pump activity due to 
underlying mutation.3
Primary: No underlying etiology identified and arising in normal background mucosa (either from gastric body or antrum):
 ◊Type 3: sporadic.
• Presence of other pathologic components (eg, non-neuroendocrine components)

PRINCIPLES OF PATHOLOGY FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF NEUROENDOCRINE NEOPLASMS1
Optional Information:
• IHC staining4,5
Site-specific markers (eg, TTF-1, CDX2, SATB2) can be used as indicated in well-differentiated NET.6
In challenging cases of high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasm, especially for pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm, Rb, p53,7 p16, ATRX, 
and DAXX may be used as a panel to help distinguish grade 3 NETs from NECs.a
If there is a clinical suspicion of Merkel cell carcinoma, CK20 and Merkel cell polyomavirus stains may be used.
Additional stains (eg, trypsin, chymotrypsin, BCL10) may be used in higher grade pancreatic neoplasms to exclude acinar cell carcinoma 
expressing neuroendocrine markers.
Hormone staining with IHC is not helpful and, if positive, it does not mean there is a functional tumor.
• Additional workup may be used as indicated if the morphology or staining characteristics are unusual.
Functional Status
• Functioning NETs should have the same pathologic diagnosis as the non-functioning NETs at the same anatomic site, since the functional 
status is based upon clinical symptoms and should not alter the pathologic diagnosis. 
Classification and Grade8
• Many classification schemes have been proposed for NETs.9-16 The most recent WHO classification system is suggested for 
gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs and represents an attempt to unify European and American approaches.15 Multiple site-specific grading 
systems also exist.
Ki-67 Index:
 ◊Follow College of American Pathologists guidelines for assessment and specify exact Ki-67 proliferative index in report, not a range.
	
– Ki-67 index is reported as the percentage of positive tumor cells in the area of highest nuclear labeling (referred to as hot spots). 
	
– Ki-67 should be performed on all types of specimens, primary or metastatic, biopsy or resection (as long as there are at least 500 tumor 
cells present and the specimen is assessable without crush artifact or significant intermixed inflammatory cells).
	
– Ki-67 proliferative index should also be assessed for every specimen sampled metachronously. For multiple sections sampled from 
a single tumor, Ki-67 stain should be performed on the block(s) of tumor with the highest mitotic index. Multiple tumor blocks may 
be used for this staining, and the tumor grade would be based on the highest proliferative index (specific example: Ki-67 proliferative 
index assessed for every focus of multifocal ileal NET as well as from mesenteric mass). When there are synchronous specimens from 
multiple primary tumors(s) and/or metastases, Ki-67 should be performed on at least 1 block from each of the primary and metastatic 
locations.
a Clinical, functional imaging, and molecular features should be taken into account as well.

Classification and Grade8 (continued)
Mitotic Rate:
 ◊Mitotic rate should be based on counting mitoses in the areas of highest mitotic density, and should be reported as the number of 
mitoses per 2 mm2.
 ◊Note that in cases where an accurate mitotic rate is precluded by inadequate tissue, such as in small biopsy samples including fine-
needle aspiration, the Ki-67 index is the preferred method of establishing the proliferative rate.
• If both mitotic rate and Ki-67 index are used and these are discordant, it is currently recommended that the higher grade be used to assign 
classification.17
• The pathologist should report the actual parameters used to assign grade (ie, mitotic rate, proliferation index) so clinicians have the 
necessary information to make informed treatment decisions.
• Specific classification and grading scheme being utilized should be reported in parentheses after the diagnosis to avoid confusion with 
overlapping terminology and criteria used in other systems. 
• The raw data used to derive the grade should be reported. 
• Regardless of the system used, it is most important to realize that the term “neuroendocrine tumor” or “neuroendocrine carcinoma” without 
any further qualification as to grade is inadequate for prognostication and therapy and is inappropriate for pathology reporting.6,18
Special Considerations:
• Keratin and neuroendocrine markers can be positive in certain neoplasms that may morphologically resemble, but are not classic 
neuroendocrine neoplasms. They are treated differently; therefore, correct identification or exclusion of these neoplasms in the appropriate 
clinical context is necessary. These include (but are not limited to) pancreatic acinar cell carcinomas, Merkel cell carcinomas, Ewing 
sarcoma, and desmoplastic round cell tumor. The terminology “carcinoma with neuroendocrine features” or “adenocarcinoma with 
neuroendocrine features” should be avoided, and a definite WHO-recommended tumor classification should be attempted (adenocarcinomas 
in the GI tract can often express neuroendocrine markers patchily, without any survival or management significance).19 In case of 
ambiguous histology and challenges in interpreting the neoplasm, this should be stated clearly in the report, indicating the importance of 
clinical correlation, and recommending molecular testing (broad next-generation sequencing [NGS] panel).

b Mitotic rates are to be expressed as the number of mitoses/2 mm2 (equaling 10 high-power fields at 40x magnification and an ocular field diameter of 0.5 mm) as 
determined by counting in 50 fields of 0.2 mm2 (ie, in a total area of 10 mm2); the Ki-67 proliferation index value is determined by counting at least 500 cells in the 
regions of highest labeling (hot spots), which are identified at scanning magnification; the final grade is based on whichever of the two proliferation indexes places the 
neoplasm in the higher grade category.
c PDNECs are not formally graded but are considered high grade by definition.
d In most MiNENs, both the neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine components are poorly differentiated, and the neuroendocrine component has proliferation indexes 
in the same range as other NECs, but this conceptual category allows for the possibility that one or both components may be well differentiated; when feasible, each 
component should therefore be graded separately.

Adrenal Gland Tumors
NCCN Guidelines Index
Table of Contents
Discussion
Required Information:
• Tumor laterality
• Adrenal gland weight
• Size of the tumor
• Extent of tumor invasion
• Histologic subtypes
• Mitotic tumor grade based on mitosis count per 10 mm2 in the area with the highest mitotic activity (applicable to adult tumor only):
Low grade, ≤20 mitoses per 10 mm2 
High grade, >20 mitoses per10 mm2
• Ki-67 proliferation index at hot spots assessed manually on printed images or by validated automated image analysis
• Presence of lymphatic and or vascular invasion
• Margin status
• Regional lymph node status 
Include number of lymph nodes examined and number of positive lymph nodes 
• Distant metastasis, if applicable
• Pathologic staging (ST-13)
Optional Information:
• IHC and special staining:
SF1 (the most reliable marker confirming adrenocortical origin)
Melan-A, calretinin, synaptophysin, and alpha-inhibin (less specific biomarkers)
PHH3 is helpful in highlighting mitosis
Reticulin special stain shows loss of nested architecture in carcinoma 
p53 and beta-catenin may help identify aggressive tumors
Special Considerations:
• Pathology diagnosis of ACC is based on morphologic and/or IHC evidence of differentiation (SF1 is the most specific marker confirming 
adrenocortical origin) and evidence of malignancy based on one of several applicable multiparameter scoring systems. Histology features 
assessed in the scoring systems include invasive growth (eg, angioinvasion, capsular invasion, local gross invasion), Ki-67 proliferation 
index, mitotic count, atypical mitosis, tumor necrosis, and a combination of cytologic and architectural features. 
The multiparameter scoring systems are Weiss, Modified Weiss, Reticulin algorithm, Helsinki score, and Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia system for 
adult adrenocortical tumor and Wieneke Criteria for pediatric adrenocortical tumor. Meeting the criteria based on one of the applicable 
multiparameter scoring systems supports the diagnosis of ACC.

Required Information:
• Tumor focality
• Anatomic site of tumor
• Size of the tumor
• Extent of tumor invasion
• Margin status
• Regional lymph node status 
Include number of lymph nodes examined and number of positive lymph nodes
• Distant metastasis, if applicable
• Tumor proliferation rate
Assess Ki-67 proliferation index and mitotic count from areas with the highest proliferative activities (hot spots). Ki-67 proliferation index 
can be done either manually on printed images or by validated automated image analysis.
• Positive for 2 of 3 IHC markers for NETs (synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and INSM1)

High proliferation rate (mitotic count and Ki-67 proliferation index), comedonecrosis, diffuse growth pattern, and high cellularity
Optional Information:
• IHC stain of tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and GATA3
• Loss of succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur subunit B (SDHB) by IHC can guide genetic testing for SDHx gene mutation.
• Loss of fumarate hydratase (FH) together with overexpression of 2-succinocysteine (2SC) by IHC can guide the screening for FH-related 
tumors.
Special Considerations:
• All PCCs and PGLs should be considered potentially malignant with a lifelong risk of metastasis; the adjectives "benign" and "malignant" 
should not be used in pathology diagnosis. 
• Several systems including Pheochromocytoma of the Adrenal gland Scaled Score (PASS), Grading of Adrenal Pheochromocytoma and 
Paraganglioma (GAPP), modified GAPP, and Composite Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma Prognostic Score (COPPS) have been proposed 
to predict the risk of metastasis. No individual system is currently endorsed for routine use.

PRINCIPLES OF IMAGING
NE-D
1 OF 3
Anatomic Imaging
• Cross-sectional imaging should include the primary site of disease. Either CT or MRI is appropriate.
• The liver is a common metastatic site for NET, and these metastatic lesions are often hypervascular. Multiphase (dual-phase) contrast-
enhanced (arterial and portal venous phase) CT is important because NETs frequently enhance in the arterial phase. SSTR-PET/CT should be 
interpreted in combination with dual-phase CT or MRI to identify both SSTR(+) and SSTR(-) sites of disease. PET/CT and PET/MRI scanners 
are capable of providing full diagnostic multiphase contrast-enhanced CT and MRI scans. This provides the most accurate correlation of 
anatomic sites and receptor status. When possible, SSTR-PET/CT and SSTR-PET/MRI should be performed concurrently with diagnostic 
multiphase CT or MRI.
• Without a known tumor or specific clinical concern, imaging should include chest CT ± contrast and imaging of the brain is generally not 
required for well-differentiated NET.
• For metastatic well-differentiated NET, anatomic imaging should generally be performed every 12 weeks–12 months based on clinical or 
pathologic signs of aggressiveness.
• Consider MRI over CT to minimize radiation risk.
Functional Imaginga
• Evaluation with SSTR imaging to assess receptor status and distant disease is appropriate. This is especially important for determining 
whether a patient may benefit from SSTR-directed therapy.  
SSTR-based imaging options include SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI, or octreotide SPECT/CT (only if SSTR-PET is not available).
Examples of appropriate SSTR-PET tracers: 68Ga-DOTATATE, 68Ga-DOTATOC, or 64Cu-DOTATATE.
SSTR-positive if uptake in measurable lesions is greater than liver.
• Whenever possible, SSTR-PET/CT should be performed in combination with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI (dual-phase hepatic CT or MRI 
imaging preferred) to minimize the total number of imaging studies. The contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is vital to identify lesions that are 
SSTR-negative as well as those that are SSTR-positive. 
• Octreotide SPECT/CT is much less sensitive for defining SSTR-positive disease than SSTR-PET/CT, and typically cannot be done in 
combination with multiphase CT or MRI. Therefore, SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI is preferred. 
• FDG-PET should be considered in select cases where G2 or higher NETs or NECs is documented.
• As with SSTR-PET/CT, combining FDG-PET with dual-phase liver CT or MRI is preferred.
• Combining FDG-PET and SSTR-PET, even for lower grade tumors, and a combined score of FDG-PET and SSTR-PET gives more prognostic 
value and outperforms pathologic grading.1
a Data on the role of functional imaging in PCC/PGL is evolving and the preferred method remains unclear.

Surveillance
• After potentially curative surgery, surveillance is recommended for at least 10 years for most patients. In certain cases, surveillance may be 
extended beyond 10 years based on risk factors such as age and risk of recurrence. However, data are limited on the optimal surveillance 
schedule beyond 10 years.
Transthoracic Echocardiogram to Assess for Carcinoid (NET-Related) Heart Disease2,3
• Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is important for the evaluation of CHD and should include morphologic evaluation of the valves 
(especially tricuspid and pulmonary), as well as assessment of the right heart size and function. When valve disease is present, an agitated 
saline injection should be performed to determine whether there is an atrial level shunt. 
• Post valve replacement, patients should be followed with serial echocardiograms according to institutional practice. If valves are abnormal 
by echocardiogram, consider the potential for clots requiring resumption of anticoagulants versus recurrent CHD.

Repeat TTE Recommendations for Patients with NETs:
Without known CHD
• Symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, edema, or ascites
• Physical exam findings including elevated jugular venous pressure, edema, or ascites
• Prior to planned bowel/liver resection
• Reassessment every 1–3 years
Known CHD with or 
without prior valve 
surgery

PRINCIPLES OF BIOCHEMICAL TESTING1-9
• Some NETs can secrete specific neuroendocrine hormones. Hormonal workup should be guided by the presence of symptoms of the excess hormone. 
Screening for hormones in individuals with asymptomatic disease is not routinely required.
Patients with functional tumors have clinical symptoms related to tumor-associated hormone excess.
• PPIs, other drugs, some medical conditions, and certain foods are known to cause false elevations in serum gastrin and chromogranin A. To confirm 
diagnosis, serum gastrin should ideally be checked when fasting and off PPI for >1 week. However, PPI should be continued in patients with overt clinical 
symptoms of gastrinoma and/or risks of complications.
• If MEN2 is suspected, patients should be evaluated for PCC/PGL prior to any procedures.8

PRINCIPLES OF SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS
• Standard oncologic surgery (eg, distal pancreatectomy/splenectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy) is appropriate for most resectable, non-
metastatic PanNETs. However, there are additional considerations for the following circumstances:
Tumor enucleation should be considered primarily for insulinomas, which are highly symptomatic (hypoglycemic) but rarely malignant. 
Peripheral insulinomas should be considered for enucleation/local resection or spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy, when technically 
feasible.
For patients with small (<2 cm) low-grade PanNETs, decisions on surgery versus active surveillance need to be individualized, based on 
tumor size/characteristics and patient characteristics:   
 ◊Tumors <1 cm have a lower malignant potential than tumors measuring 1–2 cm.  
 ◊Other radiographic characteristics of small tumors (homogeneous, well-circumscribed) may also correlate with benign behavior.  
 ◊Patient characteristics such as age and comorbidities are important when determining whether surveillance is appropriate.
 ◊Black patients with 1–2 cm low-grade PanNETs may have similar risk for lymph node metastases as white patients with >2 cm tumors.1 
 ◊Calcification is associated with higher tumor grade and increased rate of lymph node metastasis.2
• Surgical resection of lung tumors is recommended for localized and resectable locoregional disease. There are no randomized data 
regarding extent of surgical resection but retrospective analyses suggest that if the tumor can be resected completely, a sublobar resection 
may yield outcomes similar to a lobectomy even for atypical carcinoids.3
• Resection for larger (>2 cm) or malignant-appearing non-functional and functional PanNETs (ie, glucagonoma, VIPoma, somatostatinoma) 
should include total removal of the tumor with negative margins (including adjacent organs) and regional lymph nodes. Tumors of the head 
are generally treated with pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure); tumors of the body and tail are treated with distal pancreatectomy 
and splenectomy or spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. Generally surgery will include splenectomy, but with benign insulinoma, 
spleen preservation should be considered.
Assess implications of pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) in metastatic disease. In this setting, such surgery is usually not 
curative and impacts liver-directed therapy long-term. 
• Resection of GI NETs should include adequate regional lymph node resection (including all palpable disease where feasible). This is 
especially important for small bowel NETs were manual palpation of the entire length of bowel is recommended as the rate of synchronous 
primary tumors is high (15%–30% incidence). Resection of palpated lesions can be performed using a hybrid minimally invasive approach, if 
feasible.
• Resection of recurrent locoregional disease, isolated distant metastases, or a previously unresectable tumor that has regressed should be 
considered for selected patients with adequate performance status.
• In the setting of metastatic disease, resection of ileum/jejunum NETs (primary tumors and mesenteric lymph nodes) should be performed 
when symptoms arise from the primary tumor. In asymptomatic cases, resection should be considered to reduce future obstruction, 
mesenteric ischemia, bleeding, or perforation.

Discussion
• Cytoreductive surgery of >90% of metastatic disease may provide symptomatic relief, prevent future symptoms, and improve progression-free 
survival for patients with functioning tumors. This strategy is particularly appropriate for patients with relatively indolent metastatic small bowel 
NETs, and less appropriate for patients in whom rapid progression of disease is expected after surgery. Patients who are symptomatic from 
hormonal syndromes, such as carcinoid syndrome, typically derive palliation from cytoreductive surgery.
Parenchymal sparing surgery, including enucleation of liver metastases ± ablation, is preferred to preserve as much liver parenchyma as 
possible.  
• Cholecystectomy is recommended when performing surgery for advanced NETs in patients anticipated to receive long-term somatostatin 
analogs (SSAs), as these patients are at higher risk of developing biliary symptoms and cholecystitis.
• Liver-directed therapies (eg, liver resection, thermal ablation, chemoembolization) for hepatic metastases from NETs following 
pancreatoduodenectomy are associated with increased risk for cholangitis and liver abscess.
• In cases of significant CHD, valve replacement should be done prior to liver resection if at all possible.
• Octreotide therapy should be considered parenterally prior to induction of anesthesia in patients with carcinoid syndrome to prevent 
carcinoid crisis.4
• All patients who undergo a splenectomy should receive vaccination against encapsulated bacterium (ie, pneumococcus, haemophilus 
influenzae b, meningococcal group C). These vaccinations should be administered at least 14 days before elective splenectomy, if possible. 
If the vaccinations are not administered before surgery, they should be administered after the procedure as soon as the patient's condition is 
stable.
• For MEN1-related surgical principles, see MEN1-A.
• For MEN2-associated PCCs, subtotal adrenalectomy may be an option for select patients.

PRINCIPLES OF HEREDITARY CANCER RISK ASSESSMENT AND GENETIC COUNSELING
• The decision to offer genetic testing involves three related stages:   
1) Pre-test counseling prior to ordering testing;  
2) Consideration of the most appropriate testing strategy; and  
3) Testing result disclosure and post-test counseling.  
• It is recommended that a genetic counselor, medical geneticist, endocrinologist, oncologist, surgeon, oncology nurse, or other health 
professional with expertise and experience in cancer genetics be involved at each stage whenever possible. Clinicians without direct referral 
access to the appropriate expertise should be aware of the telehealth genetic counseling options available. These resources can be found 
through the National Society of Genetic Counselors “Find a Genetic Counselor” tool (www.nsgc.org). 
1) Pre-Test Counseling:
• Pre-test counseling includes the following elements:
Evaluation of patient’s knowledge, needs/concerns, and goals for familial risk assessment.
Detailed family history (including cancers/tumors and age at diagnosis, as well as clinical symptoms that can indicate an underlying 
endocrine neoplasia) in first-, second-, and third-degree family members on each side of the family.
Detailed past medical history and review of systems, including:
 ◊Documentation of prior genetic testing results for patients and their family members; and
 ◊Personal cancer/tumor history including age of diagnosis and treatment.
Focused physical examination (conducted by qualified clinician) when indicated.
Generation of differential diagnosis and educating the patient on inheritance pattern, penetrance, variable expressivity, and the possibility 
of genetic heterogeneity.
Discussion of possible genetic testing result outcomes, including positive (pathogenic or likely pathogenic), negative, and variants of 
uncertain significance (VUS).
Discussion of the clinical implications of testing results to the patient.
Discussion of the clinical implications of testing results to potentially affected family members and their available options for pursuing risk 
assessment, testing, and management.
Cost of genetic testing.
Current legislation regarding genetic discrimination and the privacy of genetic information.

2) Considerations When Determining the Most Appropriate 
Testing Strategy:
• The introduction of multigene testing for hereditary endocrine 
neoplasia syndromes has rapidly altered the clinical approach 
to genetic testing of patients.
• Given the possible overlap in clinical presentation amongst 
hereditary endocrine neoplasias, multigene panel testing may 
be more efficient and cost-effective in many situations.
• As commercially available tests differ in the specific genes 
analyzed, variant classification, and other factors (eg, methods 
of DNA/RNA analysis or option to reflex from a narrow to a 
larger panel; provision of financial assistance for cascade 
testing of relatives), it is important to consider the indication for 
testing and the expertise of the laboratory when choosing the 
specific laboratory and test panel.
• The interpretation of genetic testing remains subjective and 
complex. The interpretations can differ based on interlaboratory 
classification rules, access to unique case-level data, and other 
evidence. Additionally, variants may need to be reconsidered 
and reclassified as additional data emerge in the field.
• Genetic testing performed to identify somatic mutations arising 
in malignant cells is often not designed to detect germline 
variants and may thus be inadequate for evaluation of an 
underlying hereditary endocrine neoplasia syndrome.
• Testing for unaffected family members when no affected 
member is available should be considered. Significant 
limitations of interpreting test results should be discussed.
3) Post-Test Counseling Includes the Following Elements:
• Discussion of results and implications for patient and/or family members.
• Interpretation of results in context of personal and family history. 
• Likely pathogenic variants are usually clinically managed similarly to 
pathogenic variants, while patients with VUS and likely benign variants 
should be managed based on the cancers/tumors in the family.
• For patients with positive results:
Discussion of recommended medical management. 
Discussion of the importance of notifying family members and offering 
materials/resources for information and testing of family members.
For many hereditary endocrine neoplasia syndromes, testing of children 
is indicated since screening interventions often start in childhood or 
adolescence.
Discussion of available resources such as high-risk clinics, disease-
specific support groups, and research studies.
For patients of reproductive age, advise about options for prenatal 
diagnosis and assisted reproduction, including pre-implantation genetic 
diagnosis.
Consider carrier status implications of certain autosomal recessive 
disorders.
• For patients with negative results:
Discussion of possible etiologies for their personal/family history 
including sporadic, multifactorial, or unidentified hereditary factors.
For patients with a clinical diagnosis of an endocrine neoplasia 
condition (such as MEN1) and negative genetic testing, consider 
following the related surveillance recommendations for patient and first-
degree family members.

4) Recommend Genetic Risk Evaluation and Genetic Testing for Hereditary Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes for Patients Meeting Any of the 
Following Criteria: 
• ACC. See Hereditary Cancer Predisposition Syndromes Associated with Adrenocortical Carcinoma (NE-G 6 of 8).
• PCC/PGL
• Parathyroid adenoma or primary hyperparathyroidism before age 30, multiple parathyroid adenomas, multigland hyperplasia (without 
obvious secondary causes), or recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism 
• Clinical suspicion for MEN1 due to ≥2 of the following, or 1 AND a family history of ≥1 of the following: 
Primary hyperparathyroidism
Duodenal NET/PanNET
Pituitary adenoma
Foregut carcinoid (lung, thymic, or gastric)
• Clinical suspicion for MEN2 due to the presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma or other combination of MEN2-related features
• A mutation identified on tumor genomic testing that has clinical implications if also identified in the germline (eg, tumor analysis shows 
mutation in BRCA1/2 or MMR gene)
• Close blood relative with a known pathogenic variant/likely pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene
• A first-degree relative meeting one of the above criteria but not available for testing
5) Consider Genetic Risk Evaluation and Genetic Testing for Patients Meeting Any of the Following Criteria:
• Gastrinoma (duodenal/pancreatic or type 2 gNET) 
• Multifocal PanNETs
• Duodenal NET/PanNET at any agea
• Other combinations of tumors or cancers in the patient and/or their family members
Endocrine neoplasia manifestations or medical conditions associated with specific hereditary syndromes and clinical manifestations are 
outlined in this table: Tumor Associations of Hereditary Endocrine Neoplasia Syndromes (NE-G 4 of 8). 
a Studies of unselected patients with PanNETs have identified germline variants in 16%–17% of cases. However, these studies involved relatively small cohorts 
of patients. Raj N, Shah R, Stadler Z, et al. Real-time genomic characterization of metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors has prognostic implications and

PCC/PGL-Specific Screening Recommendations for Patients with Confirmed Germline Hereditary Syndromes5-8
Hereditary PCC/PGL syndromee,9
• Surveillance starting at 6–10 years for patients with SDHB mutations and 10–15 years for patients with all other forms of hereditary PCC/PGL. 
If asymptomatic and without a prior history of elevation, annual follow-up and testing can be omitted or done with imaging every 2–3 years.
Blood pressure monitoring at all medical visits.
Annual measurement of plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urine for fractionated metanephrines.
Cross-sectional imaging of skull base to pelvis every 2–3 years. Whole body MRI (if available) or other non-radiation–containing imaging 
procedures. If whole body MRI not available, may consider abdomen MRI, skull base and neck MRI, and chest CT.f,g,10,11
Since SDH genes have variability in their tumor penetrance and risk for malignancy, consideration can be given to modified screening 
intervals, especially for less penetrant genes such as SDHA. 
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 22
• Surveillance starting by age 11 years for children in the American Thyroid Association high risk (ATA-H) and highest risk (ATA-HST) 
categories and by age 16 years in children in the ATA moderate risk (ATA-MOD) category:
Annual measurement of plasma free metanephrines or 24-hour urine for fractionated metanephrines.
Adrenal imaging with CT or MRI is indicated in patients with positive biochemical results.
von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
• Blood pressure monitoring at all medical visits starting at age 2 years.
• Annual measurement of plasma free metanephrines (preferred) or 24-hour urine for fractionated metanephrines starting at age 5 years.
• Abdomen MRI (preferred) or CT with and without intravenous (IV) contrast every 2–3 years starting at age 15 years.
Surgical Recommendations for Patients with Suspected or Confirmed PCC/PGL Syndromes
• Preoperative alert: Patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of a hereditary PCC/PGL syndrome should have blood and/or urine 
screening for tumors prior to any surgical procedures. 
• Patients with hereditary PCC/PGL, MEN2, and VHL have an appreciable risk for bilateral tumors. Consideration should be given to cortical-
sparing adrenalectomy.
e Patients with SDHD, SDHAF2, and MAX mutations are most at risk if the pathogenic variant was paternally inherited. Recommend following the above 
recommendations if the parent of origin is unknown. Consider screening for patients with maternally inherited variants as case reports of tumor occurrence exist.
f Optimal interval for imaging surveillance is not known and much of the data are based on expert opinion.
g Available data suggest that patients with SDHAF2 mutations are primarily at risk for head and neck tumors and patients with MAX mutations are primarily at risk for 
adrenal tumors. Therefore, consideration can be given to more targeted imaging in these cohorts.

PRINCIPLES OF SYSTEMIC ANTI-TUMOR THERAPY
Locoregional Advanced and/or Distant Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors  
of the Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2)
• Systemic therapy may not be appropriate for every patient with locoregional advanced and/or distant metastatic disease. Consider 
multidisciplinary discussion to determine the best choice of treatment, including: observation for patients with stable disease with mild 
tumor burden, locoregional therapy, cytoreductive surgery, or systemic therapy, which may be appropriate considerations. 
• Currently, there are no data to support a specific sequence of regional versus systemic therapy, and no data to guide sequencing of the 
following systemic therapy options.
• There is no known role for systemic treatment in the adjuvant setting for NETs.
• Doses and schedules are subject to appropriate modifications depending on the circumstances.
• For management of hormone-related symptoms for GI tumors, see NET-9. For management of carcinoid syndrome, see NET-14.

subcutaneous injection may be substituted for IV nivolumab. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV 
nivolumab.
q There are no comparative data to define optimal treatment after first-line systemic therapy.
r Dabrafenib + trametinib can be considered for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and have no 
satisfactory alternative treatment options.
s Entrectinib, larotrectinib, and repotrectinib can be considered for patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive tumors without a known acquired resistance mutation, that 
are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe morbidity, and that have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have progressed following 
treatment.
t Repotrectinib can also be considered for patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive tumors that progressed on a prior NTRK-targeted treatment.
u Selpercatinib can be considered for patients with RET gene fusion-positive tumors that have progressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no 
satisfactory alternative treatment options.

w Monitor mitotane blood levels. Some institutions recommend target levels of 
14–20 mcg/mL if tolerated. Steady-state levels may be reached several months 
after initiation of mitotane. Life-long hydrocortisone ± fludrocortisone replacement 
usually is required with mitotane.
x Mitotane may have more benefit for control of hormone symptoms than control of 
tumor.
y Studies have demonstrated efficacy in the setting of cortisol excess in states like 
adrenal adenomas, adrenal carcinomas, and ectopic ACTH syndrome.

PRINCIPLES OF RADIATION THERAPY1,2
General Principles:
• EBRT is a useful modality for select patients with locoregional or metastatic neuroendocrine or adrenal tumors.
• Decisions to use EBRT should be made in a multidisciplinary manner, considering patient factors, disease site/stage, and other therapeutic options 
available.  
• EBRT may be considered for any histologic subtype of NETs (including well-differentiated grade 1/2/3, NECs, MiNENs, PCCs, and PGLs).
• Site-specific principles used for other primary cancer types are generally applicable; see appropriate NCCN Guidelines (eg, Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, 
Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Biliary Tract Cancers).
• Higher EBRT doses have been associated with higher rates of disease control, but may be associated with increased risk of adverse events.3  
• Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) techniques with image-guided RT (IGRT) may be needed to maintain RT precision 
and reduce the risk of toxicity.
• When administering SBRT4/stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR),5 IGRT techniques and motion management (if applicable) are strongly 
recommended to maintain RT precision and reduce the risk of toxicity.
• Using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, most patients achieve partial response or stable disease after EBRT, whereas complete response is 
less common.
Locoregional Disease:
• EBRT may be considered as a treatment option for select patients with locoregional NETs that are locally advanced/unresectable, potentially resectable but 
with unacceptable morbidity, or in patients who are medically inoperable due to comorbidity.
• Specific sites where EBRT may be considered include lung, thymus, and locations in the GI tract where resection may be associated with significant 
morbidity, such as esophagus, stomach, pancreas, or rectum. Depending on disease site, treatment may be adjuvant (postoperative), definitive, or 
palliative. For details on techniques, please refer to the appropriate NCCN Guidelines for the respective primary cancer types.
• EBRT generally does not play a role in the management of locoregional NETs of the small bowel, appendix, or colon (including mesenteric disease), due 
to risk of bowel injury. However, focal EBRT may be considered in select circumstances using conformal techniques and careful attention to bowel dose 
constraints.
• The use of concurrent radiosensitizing chemotherapy may be considered depending on the histologic subtype.
Metastatic Disease:
• EBRT may be considered in select situations for metastatic NET or PCC/PGL6:
Palliation of symptomatic metastases, such as painful bone metastases, or impending pathologic fracture or cord compression.
Liver-directed EBRT in patients with limited (<5) liver metastases. EBRT may be used alone, or in combination with other liver-directed therapies 
(resection, ablation, and/or embolization). Consider SBRT4/SABR5 to achieve durable disease control. For details on techniques, please refer to the 
NCCN Guidelines for Hepatocellular Carcinoma, Principles of Radiation Therapy. 
SBRT4/SABR5 (≤5 fractions) and hypofractionated RT (6–20 fractions) can be considered for oligometastatic disease at multiple sites, including (but not 
limited to) liver, adrenal, bone (including spine), lung, mediastinum, head and neck, and lymph nodes. An ablative dose is delivered to the tumor while 
respecting the surrounding organ and adjacent normal tissue constraints. 
Treatment of functional NETs to improve hormonal symptoms.
• Hypofractionated regimens (≤10 fractions) are most frequently used.

PRINCIPLES OF PEPTIDE RECEPTOR RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY WITH LUTETIUM LU 177 DOTATATE1-10
• Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a radiolabeled SSA used as PRRT. 
• It is approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients ≥12 years of age with SSTR-positive GEP NETs, including foregut, 
midgut, and hindgut NETs.1,2
• Currently there are no randomized data, but there are reports of treatment efficacy and favorable outcomes when PRRT is used for PCCs, 
PGLs, and lung/thymic NETs.3-10 If feasible, participation in clinical trials of PRRT is strongly recommended for patients with such rare 
groups of NET.
• PRRT may reduce symptoms for symptomatic insulinoma and other functional NETs.11
Key Eligibility:
• Well-differentiated NET
• SSTR expression of NET as detected by SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MR (NE-D)a,b
• Adequate bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function
Preparing Eligible Patients for Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate
• Do not administer long-acting SSAs (eg, octreotide LAR, lanreotide) for 4 weeks prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate treatment. Administer 
short-acting octreotide as needed for symptom control of carcinoid syndrome; discontinue at least 24 hours prior to initiating lutetium Lu 
177 dotatate.
• Counsel patients about the risks of:
Radiation exposure to themselves and others
Myelosuppression
Secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia 
Renal toxicity
Hepatic toxicity
Neuroendocrine hormonal crisis or carcinoid crisis: flushing, diarrhea, hypotension, bronchoconstriction, or other signs and symptoms
Embryo-fetal toxicity
Infertility
Nausea/vomiting (related to amino acid infusion required as part of therapy)
• Discuss radiation safety precautions during and after lutetium Lu 177 dotatate.
• Verify pregnancy status in patients of childbearing potential.
• Advise on use of effective contraception for up to 7 months (patients assigned female at birth) and 4 months (patients assigned male at 
birth) after last dose of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate.
a SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI of skull vertex to mid-thigh with multiphase IV contrast when 
possible. Data are limited on the optimal timing of scans following administration of SSAs.
b SSTR-PET tracers (eg, 68Ga-DOTATATE, 64Cu-DOTATATE, and 68Ga-DOTATOC).

Dose and Administration
• Lutetium  Lu 177 dotatate is administered via peripheral IV at a dose of 200 mCi over 30–40 minutes every 8 weeks for a total of 4 treatments 
(unless dose modification required secondary to adverse reactions).
• Amino acid solution:
IV infusion of amino acids is a critical part of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate therapy for nephroprotection. 
Amino acids are administered 30 minutes before, concurrently with, and 3 hours after lutetium Lu 177 dotatate.  
Commercial (nonselective) amino acid formulations infused at high rates are more emetogenic than compounded amino acids.  
 ◊Solutions containing only arginine/lysine are only available through compounding pharmacies, but are much less emetogenic than 
commercial amino acid solutions. Options for compounded amino acids are as follows: 
	
– Arginine 2.5%/lysine 2.5% in 1000 mL NaCl infused at 250 mL/h for 4 hours.  
	
– Commercial amino acid formulation (typically containing approximately 20 amino acids) mixed in sterile water for a total volume of 
approximately 2000 mL. Infusion rate can be increased to roughly 300–500 mL/h, as tolerated. Recommend starting at low rate of 50 
mL/h and increasing by 10 mL/h every 10 minutes as tolerated based on symptoms such as nausea. Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate infusion 
should begin after at least 250 mL of amino acids have been infused. 
• Antiemetic medications should be available prior to and during amino acid and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate infusions. Aggressive antiemetic 
prophylaxis is recommended for patients when nonselective amino acid solutions are used with PRRT. Routine prophylactic antiemetics may 
not be necessary if selective (arginine/lysine) amino acid solutions are used, but should be available as needed. 
Post-treatment Instructions 
• Detailed instructions on post-treatment radiation-risk reduction strategies should be provided per institutional radiation safety guidelines.
• Complete blood count, serum chemistry including renal and hepatic functions should be monitored.
• SSAs (octreotide or lanreotide) can be administered 4–24 hours after each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate treatment.  
Timing of SSAs (Octreotide or Lanreotide) in Relation to Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate
• Most patients treated with PRRT will have had disease progression on a first-line SSA.  
• Generally, patients with hormonally functional tumors should continue octreotide LAR or lanreotide along with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. It 
is unclear whether patients with nonfunctional tumors benefit from continuation of SSA treatment during and after lutetium Lu 177 dotatate 
treatment. 
• There are theoretical concerns regarding the competition between SSAs and lutetium Lu 177 dotatate for SSTR binding. Therefore, the 
following actions are recommended:
Do not administer long-acting SSAs for 4 weeks prior to each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate treatment. 
Stop short-acting SSAs 24 hours before each lutetium LU 177 dotatate treatment. 
SSAs (short- and long-acting) can be resumed 4–24 hours after each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate treatment.

PRINCIPLES OF LIVER-DIRECTED THERAPY FOR NEUROENDOCRINE TUMOR METASTASES
• Liver-directed therapy1 consists of four categories of treatment: 
Surgical resection (which may include intraoperative thermal ablation of lesions); See Principles of Surgical Management of Neuroendocrine Tumors (NE-F)
Hepatic arterial embolization, including bland transarterial embolization [TAE], transarterial chemoembolization [TACE], and transarterial
radioembolization [TARE]
Percutaneous thermal ablation
RT (SBRT/SABR) (NE-I)
Indications for Hepatic Arterial Embolization2
• Embolization is recommended for well-differentiated NETs with liver-dominant, unresectable metastases that are: 
Symptomatic on an SSA or following another form of systemic therapy
Progressive on an SSA or following another form of systemic therapy
Presenting with bulky liver disease; embolization may be used as cytoreduction therapy without waiting for progression.
• Objective radiologic response rates vary widely in retrospective studies, but average approximately 60%, with symptom palliation in approximately 85% of 
patients with hormonal syndromes.  
• Relative contraindications include significant baseline liver dysfunction (eg, jaundice, ascites) and a liver tumor burden >70%. Prior Whipple surgery or 
biliary instrumentation (ie, sphincterotomy, stent) increases the risk of liver abscess due to biliary bacterial colonization; infectious complications occur in 
about 20% of cases following TAE/TACE and 8% after TARE, even with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.
Embolization Modalities
• TAE and TACE
There are no completed randomized studies comparing TAE with conventional TACE and both are acceptable. 
Drug-eluting embolics are associated with increased hepatobiliary toxicity in the NET population, and are not recommended.
In patients with bilobar disease, TAE/TACE is generally performed over at least two procedures, approximately 1 month apart. Patients with very high liver 
tumor burden may require three or four embolizations to safely treat the entire liver. Short-acting octreotide should be administered pre-embolization for 
patients with hormonal syndromes. Overnight observation is typically appropriate to monitor and treat symptoms of post-embolization syndrome such as 
pain and nausea and exacerbation of hormone-related symptoms. 
• TARE may be considered particularly in the following scenarios:
Lobar or segmental (less than lobular) disease distribution.
Patients with prior Whipple surgery or biliary tract instrumentation (lower risk of hepatobiliary infection than TAE/TACE).3-6
TARE is better tolerated than TAE/TACE, but late radioembolization-induced chronic hepatotoxicity may occur in long-term survivors, and is particularly a 
concern among patients undergoing bilobar radioembolization. 
To date there is no evidence for or against the safety of sequencing TARE and PRRT.7,8 
Ablative Therapy
• Percutaneous thermal ablation, often using microwave energy (radiofrequency and cryoablation are also acceptable), can be considered for 
oligometastatic liver disease, generally up to four lesions each <3 cm. Feasibility considerations include safe percutaneous imaging-guided approach to 
the target lesions, and proximity to vessels, bile ducts, or adjacent non-target structures that may require hydro- or aero-dissection for displacement.

Carcinoid Syndrome
• Carcinoid syndrome primarily occurs in patients with metastatic well-differentiated NETs originating in the distal small intestine and 
proximal colon (midgut). Carcinoid syndrome can also be secondary to pulmonary NETs and rarely PanNETs. Serotonin along with other 
vasoactive substances contributes to the syndrome. 
• Signs and symptoms include flushing, diarrhea, wheezing (rare), and CHD (in patients with highly elevated serotonin levels). 
Serotonin is thought to be the most important factor in the etiology of carcinoid syndrome diarrhea and CHD, but the etiology of flushing is 
less well understood. 
Refractory flushing or diarrhea is defined as suboptimal symptom control in the setting of long-acting SSAs (octreotide LAR or lanreotide) 
used in approved doses. 
It is important to note that diarrhea can be multifactorial: other common causes include direct side effects from SSAs, pancreatic exocrine 
insufficiency from SSA use resulting in steatorrhea, bile malabsorption from ileocecectomy or cholecystectomy, and short-gut syndrome.
• Carcinoid crisis is a potentially life-threatening form of carcinoid syndrome caused by a massive release of vasoactive substances, often 
triggered by tumor manipulation or anesthesia. It is typically associated with hypotension, diarrhea, and blood pressure fluctuation.
The prevalence and risk of carcinoid crisis varies greatly across studies according to the diagnostic criteria used.1
• In patients with carcinoid syndrome, invasive procedures should only be performed in centers with experienced anesthesiologists.
• Octreotide should be available as needed during surgical procedures for patients with carcinoid syndrome who develop hemodynamic 
instability that could indicate carcinoid crisis. Doses of octreotide (100–500 mcg IV) can be used, potentially followed by IV infusion of 
octreotide (50–300 mcg/h).2
• Therapeutic levels of octreotide would not be expected to be reached for 10‒14 days after LAR injections. Short-acting SC octreotide PRN 
can help address suboptimal symptom control quickly.
• Vasopressors can be used for severe and/or prolonged hypotension.2,3
• Prophylactic administration of octreotide prior to surgery can be utilized although intraoperative complications can still arise, and the 
routine use of prophylactic octreotide has been called into question.2-5

PRINCIPLES OF HORMONE CONTROL
Symptom Management of Carcinoid Syndrome
• Carcinoid syndrome–diarrhea and flushing
Long-acting SSAs (octreotide LAR and lanreotide) are highly active for control of both flushing and diarrhea.
Telotristat 250 mg TID can be considered specifically for patients with refractory diarrhea secondary to carcinoid syndrome (usually with proven 
elevated serotonin or 5-HIAA), in combination with long-acting SSA. Symptomatic benefit can sometimes be delayed for several weeks after 
initiation of the drug.
Patients who experience symptom exacerbation towards the end of each 4-week SSA cycle can often benefit from more frequent administration 
(ie, every 3 weeks). Dose escalation can also sometimes benefit patients with refractory symptoms.
Short-acting octreotide, given subcutaneously, administered at doses of 100–250 mcg every 8 hours as needed, can be prescribed to patients 
with suboptimal control of flushing and/or diarrhea.
Serotonin antagonists such as ondansetron can improve refractory carcinoid syndrome diarrhea in patients with refractory symptoms.
Treatments that effectively cytoreduce secretory metastatic tumors are likely to palliate hormonal symptoms. For patients with liver-dominant 
disease, surgical cytoreduction or hepatic arterial embolization are highly effective at control of flushing and/or diarrhea. PRRT with lutetium Lu 
177 dotatate has been associated with delay in diarrhea progression.
Nonspecific antidiarrheals (ie, loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine, tincture of opium) can be beneficial for management of refractory diarrhea, 
regardless of cause.
• Non-carcinoid syndrome–diarrhea
In patients who develop diarrhea/steatorrhea exacerbation while on SSA, a trial of pancreatic enzymes for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency 
should be considered.  
Patients with persistent diarrhea after ileocecectomy or cholecystectomy, especially if associated with urgency, can be treated empirically with 
bile acid-binding drugs such as cholestyramine. 
For patients with presumed short-gut syndrome, suggest referral to appropriate gastroenterologist expert.
Nonspecific antidiarrheals (ie, loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine, tincture of opium) can be beneficial for management of refractory diarrhea, 
regardless of cause.
• Carcinoid heart disease
CHD should be monitored by a cardiologist with expertise in the disease as the echocardiographic diagnosis of CHD can be challenging. Valve 
replacement (typically tricuspid and pulmonary) is indicated for patients with symptomatic disease.

• Consider octreotide LARa or lanreotide.
Insulin
• Stabilize glucose levels with diet and/or diazoxide or everolimus. 
• Octreotide LARa or lanreotide can be considered but only if tumor expresses SSTRs. In the absence of 
SSTRs, octreotide LARa or lanreotide can profoundly worsen hypoglycemia. 
VIP
• Octreotide LARa or lanreotide are the first-line management for control of hormone symptoms. 
• Correct electrolyte imbalance (K+, Mg2+, HCO3-) and dehydration. 
• Corticosteroids can be effective in patients with SSTR-refractory disease.
Glucagon
• Octreotide LARa or lanreotide are the first-line management for control of hormone symptoms. 
• Treat hyperglycemia and diabetes, as appropriate.
a Short-acting octreotide can be added to octreotide LAR or lanreotide for rapid relief of symptoms or for breakthrough symptoms.

Tumor cannot be assessed
T1
Tumor limited to the pancreas,* ≤2 cm in greatest dimension
T2
Tumor limited to the pancreas,* >2 cm but ≤4 cm in greatest dimension
T3
Tumor limited to the pancreas,* >4 cm in greatest dimension; or tumor invading the 
duodenum, ampulla of Vater, or common bile duct
T4
Tumor invading adjacent organs (stomach, spleen, colon, adrenal gland) or the wall 
of large vessels (celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery/vein, splenic artery/
vein, gastroduodenal artery/vein, portal vein)
*Limited to the pancreas means there is no invasion of adjacent organs (stomach, spleen, colon,  
adrenal gland) or the wall of large vessels (celiac axis or the superior mesenteric artery).  
Extension of tumor into peripancreatic adipose tissue is NOT a basis for staging.
Note: Multiple tumors should be designated as such (the largest tumor should be used to assign T category):
• Use T(#); e.g., pT3(4) N0 M0.
• Use the m suffix, T(m); e.g., pT3(m) N0 M0.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 
Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-2 
Overview  
Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are thought to arise 
from cells throughout the diffuse endocrine system. They comprise a 
broad family of tumors, the most common of which are in the 
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, lungs and bronchi (so-called 
bronchopulmonary), thymus, and pancreas. Sites of origin within the GI 
tract include the stomach, small intestine, appendix, and rectum.1,2 Other 
NETs include those arising in the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary glands. 
NETs are part of a broader group of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), 
which include poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (PDNECs), 
as well as mixed neuroendocrine-non-NENs (MiNENs).3,4  
An analysis of the SEER database estimated that the incidence of NETs in 
the United States was 6.98 cases per 100,000 people in the year 2012.2 
This analysis suggested that the incidence of NETs is increasing, and that 
the prevalence of individuals with NETs in the United States may exceed 
170,000. Other independent analyses of the SEER database also found 
that the incidence of GI NETs increased from 1975 to 2008.5,6 The 
reasons for this increase are unclear, although it seems likely that 
improved diagnosis and classification is one factor.7 
Most NETs seem to be sporadic and risk factors for sporadic NETs are 
poorly understood. NETs may also arise in the context of inherited genetic 
syndromes, including multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1 (MEN1), 2 
(MEN2), and 4 (MEN4), and succinate dehydrogenase (SDHx) mutations. 
NETs have also been associated with other conditions, including von 
Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis complex, and 
neurofibromatosis.8,9 MEN1, associated with mutations in the menin gene, 
is characterized by multiple tumors of the parathyroid, pituitary, and 
pancreatic glands.10 MEN2, associated with mutations in the RET 
proto-oncogene, is characterized by the development of medullary thyroid 
cancer, pheochromocytoma (PCC) (often bilateral), and 
hyperparathyroidism.11 NETs have also been associated with other 
conditions, including VHL disease, tuberous sclerosis complex, and 
neurofibromatosis.8,9  
Patients with NETs can have symptoms attributable to hormonal 
hypersecretion. These symptoms include intermittent flushing and diarrhea 
in patients with GI NETs,12 bronchospasm and wheezing in lung NETs,12 
hypertension in patients with PCC or paraganglioma (PGL),13 and 
symptoms attributable to secretion of insulin, glucagon, gastrin, and other 
peptides in patients with pancreatic NETs (PanNETs).14 Patients with 
hormonal symptoms are considered to have “functional” tumors, and those 
without symptoms are considered to have “nonfunctional” tumors. 
Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of NETs often involves collaboration 
between specialists in multiple disciplines, using specific biochemical, 
radiologic, and surgical methods. Specialists include pathologists, 
endocrinologists, radiologists (including nuclear medicine specialists), and 
medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists. 
These guidelines discuss the diagnosis and management of both sporadic 
and hereditary neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors and are intended to 
assist with clinical decision-making. Most of the guideline sections pertain 
to well-differentiated, low- to intermediate-grade tumors, although 
well-differentiated high-grade tumors and extrapulmonary PDNECs/large 
or small cell carcinomas/MiNENs are also addressed (see Extrapulmonary 
Poorly Differentiated: Neuroendocrine Carcinoma/Large or Small Cell 
Carcinoma/Mixed Neuroendocrine-Non-Neuroendocrine Neoplasm, 
below). Medical practitioners should note that unusual patient scenarios 
(presenting in <5% of patients) are not specifically discussed in these 
guidelines.

MS-3 
Guidelines Update Methodology 
The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN 
Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) are available 
at www.NCCN.org. 
Literature Search Criteria 
Prior to the update of the NCCN Guidelines® for Neuroendocrine and 
Adrenal Tumors, an electronic search of the PubMed database was 
performed to obtain key literature in neuroendocrine and adrenal tumors 
since the previous Guidelines update, using the search terms: 
neuroendocrine tumor OR adrenal cancer OR carcinoid OR 
pheochromocytoma OR paraganglioma OR Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia. 
The PubMed database was chosen as it remains the most widely used 
resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical 
literature.15 
The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans 
published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: 
Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; 
Guideline; Practice Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-
Analysis; Multicenter Studies; Systematic Reviews; and Validation 
Studies. The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from 
additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed 
by the Panel during the Guidelines update have been included in this 
version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high-level 
evidence is lacking are based on the Panel’s review of lower-level 
evidence and expert opinion. 
Sensitive/Inclusive Language Usage 
NCCN Guidelines strive to use language that advances the goals of 
equity, inclusion, and representation.16 NCCN Guidelines endeavor to use 
language that is person-first; not stigmatizing; anti-racist, anti-classist, 
anti-misogynist, anti-ageist, anti-ableist, and anti-weight biased; and 
inclusive of individuals of all sexual orientations and gender identities. 
NCCN Guidelines incorporate non-gendered language, instead focusing 
on organ-specific recommendations. This language is both more accurate 
and more inclusive and can help fully address the needs of individuals of 
all sexual orientations and gender identities. NCCN Guidelines will 
continue to use the terms men, women, female, and male when citing 
statistics, recommendations, or data from organizations or sources that do 
not use inclusive terms. Most studies do not report how sex and gender 
data are collected and use these terms interchangeably or inconsistently. 
If sources do not differentiate gender from sex assigned at birth or organs 
present, the information is presumed to predominantly represent cisgender 
individuals. NCCN encourages researchers to collect more specific data in 
future studies and organizations to use more inclusive and accurate 
language in their future analyses. 
Histologic Classification and Staging of Neuroendocrine 
and Adrenal Tumors 
NENs are generally subclassified by site of origin, stage, and histologic 
characteristics (eg, differentiation and grade/proliferation rate).  
Histologic Classification 
NENs are divided into NETs and neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). The 
2019 WHO classification of NENs included significant updates, including 
harmonizing the classification of GI and pancreatic NENs.17 NETs are all 
well-differentiated while NECs are poorly differentiated neoplasms. Well-
differentiated NETs are further classified into three categories: low-grade 
(G1), intermediate-grade (G2), and high-grade (G3) based on proliferation 
rate. All PDNECs are G3 but not all G3 NENs are poorly differentiated. 
Some tumors can have mixed, both well and poorly differentiated, 
histology and are termed MiNENs. The 2022 WHO update offered 
additional refinements, largely around the emerging use of

immunohistochemical or molecular markers to facilitate classification in GI 
and pancreatic NENs.4  
Tumor differentiation and tumor grade often correlate with mitotic count 
and Ki-67 proliferation index. In fact, most commonly used histologic 
classification schemes, including the European Neuroendocrine Tumor 
Society (ENETS), World Health Organization (WHO) systems, and the 
International Agency for Research on Cancer, incorporate mitotic rate and 
Ki-67 index for GI NETs and PanNETs.14,18-22 Numerous studies have 
confirmed that increased mitotic rate and high Ki-67 index are associated 
with a more aggressive clinical course and worse prognosis.23-26 In GI 
NETs and PanNETs, well-differentiated, low-grade tumors (G1) have a 
mitotic count of <2/10 high-power field (HPF) and/or a Ki-67 index of <3%. 
Well-differentiated, intermediate-grade tumors (G2) have a mitotic count of 
2 to 20/10 HPF and/or a Ki-67 index of 3% to 20%. In high-grade 
well-differentiated tumors (G3), the mitotic count exceeds 20/10 HPF 
and/or the Ki-67 index exceeds 20%.  
When both mitotic count and Ki-67 index are available and discordant, the 
higher value determines the grade classification.27-29 Ki-67 
immunohistochemistry should be analyzed and/or counted in the areas of 
highest activity referred to as “hot spots”. A key recommendation is that 
tumor differentiation, as well as Ki-67 index and/or mitotic rate, should be 
included in the pathology report. Ki-67 index is preferred over mitotic rate, 
unless there is insufficient tissue. Doing so allows the treating physician to 
factor these data into the clinical picture to make appropriate treatment 
decisions in GI NETs and PanNETs. Poorly differentiated NECs are 
automatically considered high grade (G3) and are often subtyped as large 
cell NEC, small cell NEC, and/or mixed histology (MiNENs).17  
The classification of lung and thymus NETs varies from that of 
gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs in some classification systems, and in 
particular does not include Ki-67 index and includes the assessment of 
necrosis.30 Well-differentiated NETs of the lung and thymus are classified 
as either typical carcinoid (<2 mitoses/2 mm2, and no necrosis) or atypical 
carcinoid (2–10 mitoses/2 mm2, and/or foci of necrosis), using histologic 
criteria.30,31 
High-grade, poorly differentiated lung and thymus NECs are of either small 
cell or large cell cytology, with >10 mitoses/2 mm2 and extensive foci of 
necrosis.31 However, necrosis is not a feature of thymus small cell 
carcinoma.  
Considerable debate remains as to the most appropriate Ki-67 proliferative 
threshold for the determination of tumor grade and consequent treatment 
decisions.32,33 A retrospective database review of 252 patients with 
high-grade GI NEC suggested that platinum-based chemotherapy is most 
active in those with a Ki-67 index of ≥55%.34 These results suggest that a 
higher Ki-67 cutoff than is currently recommended may be more 
appropriate to classify tumors as high grade. Conversely, for low-grade 
tumors, some studies have suggested that the currently accepted cutoff 
may be too low. An analysis of data from 274 patients with PanNETs 
found that a 5% Ki-67 cutoff (rather than 2%) was the optimal prognostic 
indicator.35 A comparable analysis based on 691 patients with jejunal-
ileocecal NETs similarly found that a threshold of 5 mitoses/10 HPF 
provided better prognostic information than one of 2 mitoses/10 HPF.36

and the Principles of Pathology for the Diagnosis of 
Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma in the algorithm for information about 
adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and PCC/PGL.  
Staging 
NETs are staged according to the AJCC tumor (T), node (N), metastasis 
(M) staging system. The AJCC introduced its first TNM staging system for 
the classification of NETs in its 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging

MS-5 
Manual.37 The T and N definitions and other staging definitions were 
revised in the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual.38 The 8th 
edition also added the first staging system for thymic tumors and adrenal 
NETs (including staging for PCC and PGL).38 The T, N, and M definitions 
for NETs of the GI tract and pancreas were updated in version 9 of the 
AJCC Cancer Staging System.39-45 NETs of the stomach, 
duodenum/ampulla, jejunum/ileum, appendix, colon/rectum, and pancreas 
have separate staging systems. The association of tumor stage with 
prognosis has been confirmed in analyses of the SEER database and the 
National Cancer Database.46-52 An analysis of 691 patients with jejunal-
ileocecal NETs treated at the Moffitt Cancer Center between 2000 and 
2010 revealed 5-year survival rates of 100%, 100%, 91%, and 72% for 
stages I through IV, respectively, further validating the TNM staging 
system.36 Of note, however, this analysis also suggested that, unlike other 
malignancies, primary tumor size and depth of invasion had little bearing 
on survival in early-stage disease.33 Similar results were reported in a 
separate analysis of 6792 small intestine NETs in the SEER database, 
which found that outcomes were similar for patients with T1 and T2 
tumors.53 These results have been supported in additional analyses, 
confirming that the presence of lymph node and distant metastases have 
the strongest effect on survival.54,55 
The TNM staging system for the classification of PanNETs in the 8th 
edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual was separated from exocrine 
pancreatic carcinoma.37,38 The primary tumor (T) is differentiated based on 
size and involvement of major vessels or other organs (see Staging in the 
algorithm). A retrospective analysis of 425 patients with PanNETs treated 
at the Moffitt Cancer Center between 1999 and 2010 validated the AJCC 
2017 classification system, with 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 92%, 
84%, 81%, and 57% for stages I through IV, respectively (P < .001).56 
Although the trends of this analysis are consistent with population-based 
studies, the survival rates from this analysis were significantly higher than 
those seen in population-based studies.57,58 For example, in the SEER 
database analysis of PanNETs, the 5-year survival rate for patients with 
metastatic disease was only 19.5%.58 
NETs of the lungs and bronchi are staged in the same manner as more 
common lung carcinomas. As in lung carcinoma, more advanced tumor 
stage for NETs of the lungs and bronchi is associated with worse 
prognosis.37,38 
Importantly, extrapulmonary NECs (including MiNENs) arising in any site 
are staged according to the organ-specific criteria for their 
non-neuroendocrine carcinoma counterparts (eg, adenocarcinoma or 
squamous carcinoma).59 
Pathologic Reporting 
In addition to information on histologic classification and stage, the margin 
status (positive or negative) and the presence of vascular or perineural 
invasion should be included in the pathology report; some studies have 
suggested that these factors may also have prognostic significance.60,61 
See Principles of Pathology for the Diagnosis of Neuroendocrine 
Neoplasms in the algorithm for additional information about required 
information for the pathology report.  
Whether or not tumors are associated with symptoms of hormone 
hypersecretion (”functioning” or “non-functioning”) is a clinical rather than 
histologic diagnosis. The presence of hormone-staining granules without a 
clinical syndrome does not make a tumor “functioning.” Thus, functional 
status is usually not included in the pathology report. The Panel defines 
nonfunctioning NENs as those without symptoms secondary to hormone 
production whether or not hormone levels are elevated.

MS-6 
Other Potential Prognostic Markers 
Chromogranin A is a secreted protein that is often elevated in patients with 
NETs; elevated levels have been associated with poorer prognosis.62 
However, routine use for monitoring disease has waned given challenges 
related to reproducibility across laboratories, and the impact of 
medications (eg, proton pump inhibitors [PPIs]) and comorbidities (eg, 
renal insufficiency) on lab values.63,64 The NETest is a blood-based 
biomarker test that measures the expression level of multiple analytes.65 It 
can help in the identification of small bowel, pancreas, and 
bronchopulmonary NENs, as well as PCCs and PGLs. The NETest 
demonstrated high sensitivity (>95%) in patients with well-differentiated, 
metastatic NETs66 and may help predict for recurrence post-resection.67-71 
The peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) predictive quotient 
(PPQ) assay is a related blood-based assay that integrates 
neuroendocrine gene transcripts with tumor Ki-67 index values to identify 
patients with tumors that are predicted to respond to PRRT.72 Validation 
studies are ongoing, but neither biomarker has been incorporated into 
routine care yet.  
The molecular basis of NETs remains poorly understood, and additional 
molecular predictors of outcome remain investigational. One study found 
that overexpression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or its 
downstream targets was associated with shorter OS in 195 
neuroendocrine tissue samples (15% were located in the pancreas; 85% 
were GI carcinoids).73 Small bowel carcinoid (neuroendocrine) tumors 
have been found to have recurrent mutations in the cyclin-dependent 
kinase inhibitor, CDKN1B (p27),74 and loss of CDKN1B expression has 
been reported to be an adverse prognostic factor in GEP-NETs.75 
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have also been studied as possible 
prognostic markers, based on the idea that tumor cells in the blood would 
be indicative of more disseminated disease. Another study found that the 
presence of ≥1 CTC in 7.5 mL of blood was independently associated with 
worse progression-free survival (PFS) and OS in patients with varyingly 
pretreated metastatic NETs from various primary sites.76 
Additional research related to molecular assays is ongoing. A multinational 
consensus meeting of experts concluded that, to date, no single currently 
available biomarker is sufficient as a diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive 
marker in patients with NETs.77 That said, tumor mutation profiling is 
increasingly routine for high-grade NENs, to some extent to assist with 
tumor classification, but also to identify actionable mutations.  
Principles of Hereditary Cancer Risk Assessment and 
Genetic Counseling 
Recommendations are provided regarding pre-test counseling, 
considerations when determining the most appropriate testing strategy, 
post-test counseling, and criteria for genetic risk evaluation and genetic 
testing for hereditary endocrine neoplasia syndromes (see Principles of 
Hereditary Cancer Risk Assessment and Genetic Counseling in the 
algorithm).  
Genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing for hereditary endocrine 
neoplasia syndromes are recommended in patients with any of the 
following: 1) ACC; 2) PCC/PGL; 3) parathyroid adenoma or primary 
hyperparathyroidism before age 30, multiple parathyroid adenomas, 
multigland hyperplasia (without obvious secondary causes), or recurrent 
primary hyperparathyroidism; 4) clinical suspicion for MEN2 due to the 
presence of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or other combination of 
MEN2-related features; 5) a mutation identified on tumor genomic testing 
that has clinical implications if also identified in the germline (eg, tumor 
analysis shows a mutation in BRCA1/2 or mismatch repair [MMR] gene); 
6) a close blood relative with a known pathogenic variant/likely pathogenic 
variant in a cancer susceptibility gene; 7) a first-degree relative meeting 
one of the above criteria but not available for testing; and 8) clinical

suspicion for MEN1 due to ≥2 of the following, or 1 of the following and a 
family history of ≥1 of the following: primary hyperparathyroidism, 
duodenal NET/PanNET, pituitary adenoma, or foregut carcinoid (bronchial, 
thymic, or gastric). In addition, genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing 
should be considered for patients meeting any of the following criteria: 1) 
gastrinoma (duodenal/pancreatic or type 2 gastric NET [gNET]); 2) 
multifocal PanNETs78; 3) duodenal NET/PanNET at any age; and 4) other 
combinations of tumors or cancers in the patient and/or their family 
members. Data from two relatively small cohorts of patients with PanNETs 
suggest pathogenic mutations are present in 17% of patients.78,79  
Sporadic Neuroendocrine Tumors 
Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-
Differentiated Grade 1/2), Lung, and Thymus  
Approximately one-third of neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors arise in the 
lungs or thymus, and two-thirds arise in the GI tract. Sites of origin within 
the GI tract include the stomach, small intestine, appendix, and rectum.1,2 
The prognosis for patients with NETs varies according to the stage at 
diagnosis, histologic classification, and primary site of the tumor (see 
Histologic Classification and Staging of Neuroendocrine and Adrenal 
Tumors, above).  
NETs of the GI tract, lung, or thymus may secrete various hormones and 
vasoactive peptides. Bronchial and thymic NETs have been associated 
with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production and are a cause of 
Cushing syndrome.80,81 NETs arising in the small intestine or appendix are 
more commonly associated with carcinoid syndrome, related to the 
secretion of serotonin, histamine, or tachykinins into the systemic 
circulation causing episodic flushing and diarrhea.82 Approximately 50% to 
66% of patients with carcinoid syndrome develop valvular cardiac 
complications consisting of tricuspid regurgitation and/or pulmonary 
stenosis.83 
The metabolic products released by intestinal NETs are rapidly destroyed 
by liver enzymes in the portal circulation. Thus, the classical syndrome, 
occurring in approximately 8% to 28% of patients with NETs,84,85 is not 
usually observed unless liver metastases or rarely retroperitoneal disease 
have occurred, in which case hepatic metastases release metabolic 
products directly into the systemic circulation via the hepatic veins.  
These guidelines address seven major subtypes of NETs of the GI tract, 
lung, and thymus: 1) jejunal/ileal/colon, 2) duodenal, 3) appendix, 4) rectal, 
5) gastric, 6) lung, and 7) thymus. 
Evaluation of Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-
Differentiated Grade 1/2), Lung, and Thymus  
Patients who present with suspected NETs of the GI tract, lung, or thymus 
should be evaluated with imaging studies to assess disease burden and 
possible primary location. Commonly used techniques include CT and 
MRI. NETs of the GI tract, lung, and thymus are highly vascular and can 
appear isodense with liver on conventional CT scan, depending on 
contrast phase. Multiphase CT or MRI scans with contrast should 
therefore be used for evaluation of liver metastasis. Chest CT scans with 
or without contrast are also recommended as appropriate to assess for 
lung metastases.  
Because most NETs overexpress high-affinity receptors for 
somatostatin,82,86 a peptide hormone generated by the hypothalamus that 
blocks the release of growth hormones,87 somatostatin receptor 
(SSTR)-based imaging is often considered in the initial evaluation of 
patients with NETs but is recommended particularly in patients with 
jejunal/ileal/colon NETs. Such imaging can provide useful information on 
overall tumor burden and location; additionally, positive imaging confirms 
the presence of SSTRs, which can have therapeutic implications and 
assist with staging.

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-8 
A major advance in imaging NETs came with the 2016 FDA approval of 
PET/CT imaging using the radiolabeled somatostatin analog (SSA) 
gallium-68 (68Ga)-DOTATATE. Several studies have shown the 
diagnostic utility, safety, specificity, and high sensitivity of 
68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT.88-92 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 
22 studies determined that 68Ga-DOTATATE had a pooled sensitivity and 
specificity of 91% and 94%, respectively, for the initial diagnosis of 
NETs.93 One study even showed that it was able to more correctly identify 
patients for peptide receptor radiotherapy than indium 111 
diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (In-111 DPTA) scintigraphy.94 The 
2018 Appropriate Use Criteria for Somatostatin Receptor PET Imaging in 
NETs recommends the use of SSTR PET over In-111 DPTA 
scintigraphy.88-90,95 Unless otherwise indicated, the preferred SSTR-based 
imaging in this discussion includes SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI 
imaging using 68Ga-DOTATATE, 64Cu-DOTATATE, or 68Ga-DOTATOC. 
SSTR scintigraphy using In-111 octreotide (with single-photon emission 
CT [SPECT]/CT) is appropriate only if SSTR-PET is not available. 
SSTR-PET imaging is more sensitive than SSTR scintigraphy for 
determining SSTR status. Data are limited on whether long-acting SSTR 
inhibition interferes with 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scans, but one study96 
showed that timing does not make a difference. The Panel notes that for 
jejunal/ileal/colon NETs, SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI should not be 
used to limit the extent of lymphadenectomy or small bowel resection as 
sensitivity may not be adequate. 
Additional imaging recommendations vary by disease site and include as 
appropriate: colonoscopy for ileal and colon NETs; 
esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and/or endoscopic ultrasound 
(EUS) for duodenal and certain gNETs; endorectal ultrasound for rectal 
NETs; and bronchoscopy and brain MRI for lung NETs. 
Biochemical evaluation can also be helpful in the initial diagnostic 
evaluation, particularly in patients with GI NETs who have clinical 
symptoms that are suggestive of hormone hypersecretion (most common 
in patients with primary tumors of the small bowel). Evaluation of serotonin 
secretion, using a 24-hour urine or plasma collection for 
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), is generally recommended in 
patients with metastatic lung or GI NETs with symptoms consistent with 
carcinoid syndrome, manifested by symptoms of flushing and diarrhea. 
Screening for hormones in asymptomatic individuals is not routinely 
recommended.  
Chromogranin A is sometimes used as a biochemical marker in non-
functioning tumors. Whereas one meta-analysis calculated the sensitivity 
and specificity of chromogranin A to be 73% and 95%, respectively, for 
diagnosis of NETs,97 others have questioned its value. Chromogranin A is 
elevated in patients with renal or hepatic impairment and in patients 
receiving PPIs, and in general should not be relied upon in isolation as a 
diagnostic test as it lacks specificity and test values can fluctuate, which 
can lead to false-positive results.98,99 Unlike chromogranin A, the NETest 
scores are not impacted by the use of PPIs.65 However, the Panel did not 
include NETest in the algorithm pending formal validation studies.  
Genetic counseling and testing for inherited genetic syndromes should be 
considered for patients with lung or thymic NETs. A biochemical workup 
for hypercortisolemia (Cushing syndrome) [discussed in Evaluation and 
Treatment of Hypercortisolemia (± Cushing Syndrome), below] and 
carcinoid syndrome may also be indicated in patients with lung or thymic 
NETs if signs and symptoms of hypercortisolemia are suspected. If 
hypercortisolemia (Cushing syndrome is suspected), assess for and treat 
ectopic sources of ACTH production. Details of the evaluation and 
diagnosis of a patient with Cushing syndrome from a bronchial NET have 
been published.100

MS-9 
Management of Locoregional Disease 
The management of locoregional NETs of the GI tract, lung, and thymus 
depends on tumor size, primary site, and the general condition of the 
patient. Resection is the first-line treatment approach for most localized 
NETs of the GI tract, lung, and thymus. Although symptoms of hormone 
hypersecretion are more common in patients with metastatic disease, for 
patients with locoregional disease and symptoms of hormone 
hypersecretion, symptom control with octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 
or lanreotide is paramount. Octreotide LAR and lanreotide are also 
recommended for tumor control in certain patients with unresectable 
locoregional disease [see Management of Locoregional Advanced 
Disease and/or Distant Metastases of the Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-
Differentiated Grade 1/2) and Management of Locoregional Unresectable 
Disease, Lung or Thymic Neuroendocrine Tumors, below]. Specific 
recommendations for management of NET subtypes are described herein. 
Gastric Neuroendocrine Tumors 
There are four types of gNETs: type 1 (associated with chronic atrophic 
gastritis or high gastric pH); type 2 (associated with antrum-sparing type A 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome); type 3 (sporadic and unifocal)101; and “other.” 
A SEER-based analysis of 3523 patients with gastric NENs found a 5-year 
OS rate of 53.7%.102 Types 1 and 2 gNETs are both associated with 
hypergastrinemia and are typically multifocal. The major difference 
between them is that patients with type 1 gNETs generally have antrum-
sparing atrophic gastritis with a loss of the usual negative feedback loop 
on the gastrin-producing cells of the antrum by acid (relatively high gastric 
pH), resulting in hypergastrinemia and excess stimulation of the endocrine 
cells of the fundus, and patients with type 2 gNETs have evidence of acid 
hypersecretion (low gastric pH) secondary to gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison 
syndrome).101 Type 1 gNETs demonstrate an indolent course, with a rate 
of metastases of <5%. Evidence suggestive of type 1 disease includes a 
histologic diagnosis of atrophic gastritis on gastric biopsy, elevated gastric 
pH, vitamin B12 deficiency, and positive anti-intrinsic factor antibodies (not 
all tests need to be done to make a diagnosis). For rare type 1 tumors that 
are >2 cm, the workup should include multiphasic abdomen CT or MRI 
performed with contrast. Type 2 tumors are rare and occur in the setting of 
gastrinoma in which elevated gastrin levels produce gastric 
neuroendocrine hyperplasia and multifocal gNETs.  
Endoscopic resection of tumors >1 cm is recommended for patients with 
locoregional hypergastrinemic/type 1 gNETs. For hypergastrinemic/type 2 
gNETs, endoscopic resection of gastric tumors >1 cm is recommended 
and physicians should follow the recommendations for gastrinoma for the 
identification and treatment of the gastrin-producing tumor.  
Patients with non-metastatic unifocal gNETs and normal gastrin levels 
(type 3) often have more aggressive tumors and are usually treated with 
partial or total gastrectomy, based on tumor location, with regional 
lymphadenectomy (preferred).103 For early-stage, smaller type 3 tumors, 
endoscopic104 or wedge resection can be considered if there is no 
evidence of regional lymphadenopathy on EUS or other imaging.105 
Endoscopic resection should be reserved for small (<1 cm), superficial, 
low-grade tumors.  
For the emerging category of “other” gNETs, there is increasing evidence 
that patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy may be at an 
increased risk of developing gNETs, which appear to have a much lower 
propensity to metastasize than sporadic type 3 tumors.106,107 PPI-
associated tumors are challenging to diagnose as they can be associated 
with either normal or elevated gastrin levels.  
Thymic Neuroendocrine Tumors 
The 5-year survival rate of thymic NETs is 62%.108 Localized (stage I–II) 
and locoregional (stage III A/B) NETs in the thymus are generally treated

with surgical resection without adjuvant therapy if they have been 
completely resected with negative margins.  
Lung Neuroendocrine Tumors 
NETs are most commonly located in the lung or bronchus and account for 
30.6% of NETs.109 Surgery, including lobectomy or other anatomic 
resection and mediastinal node dissection or sampling, is recommended 
for patients with stage I, II, and IIIA lung tumors. If surgery is 
contraindicated, thermal ablation or stereotactic body RT (SBRT) is 
recommended for those with stage I–II disease. If surgery is feasible and 
the disease is stage I, II, or low-grade IIIA, patients may be monitored 
post-resection under surveillance procedures as described [see 
Surveillance of Resected Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Gastrointestinal 
Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2), Lung, and Thymus, below].  
Management of Locoregional Unresectable Disease, Lung or Thymic 
Neuroendocrine Tumors 
If surgical resection is not medically feasible for patients with low-grade 
(typical carcinoid), stage IIIA/B/C lung NET or stage IIIA/B thymic NET, 
then observation (if asymptomatic), systemic therapy, or radiation therapy 
(RT) are recommended. Systemic therapy options include everolimus; 
octreotide LAR or lanreotide, if the patient has SSTR-positive disease 
and/or has hormonal symptoms; or temozolomide with or without 
capecitabine. If the stage IIIA/B/C lung disease or stage IIIA/B thymic 
disease in this setting is intermediate grade (atypical carcinoid), additional 
treatment options from those listed above include cisplatin/etoposide, 
carboplatin/etoposide, or RT with concurrent chemotherapy 
(cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/etoposide).110-112 For these patients, 
cautious observation is also an option if asymptomatic and 
non-progressive.  
Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Duodenum, Small Intestine, and Colon 
For non-functioning, localized lesions arising in the duodenum, endoscopic 
resection, transduodenal local excision with regional lymphadenectomy, or 
pancreatoduodenectomy are other options for first-line treatment of 
non-metastatic duodenal NETs. For lesions >1 cm, a multidisciplinary 
approach is recommended. For non-ampullary tumors, endoscopic or local 
excision is preferred. Pancreatoduodenectomy should be considered for 
ampullary tumors of any size not amenable to endoscopic or local 
excision. If endoscopic resection is performed, follow-up EGD should be 
performed as appropriate.  
For patients presenting with tumors in the jejunum, ileum, or colon, 
surgical resection(s) of the bowel with regional lymphadenectomy is 
recommended. The surgical procedure should include careful examination 
of the entire bowel, because multiple synchronous lesions may be present. 
In addition, the proximity to or involvement of the superior mesenteric 
artery and superior mesenteric vein should be assessed during surgery.  
Appendiceal Neuroendocrine Tumors 
Most appendiceal NETs are identified incidentally, during appendectomy 
performed for appendicitis. Most appendiceal NETs have 
well-differentiated histology, and for most appendiceal tumors ≤2 cm, 
simple appendectomy is sufficient because metastases are 
uncommon.113,114  
However, some controversy exists regarding the management of 
appendiceal NETs measuring <2 cm with more aggressive histologic 
features. Some NCCN Member Institutions thus consider right 
hemicolectomy for 1- to 2-cm tumors with poor prognostic features, such 
as lymphovascular or mesoappendiceal invasion or atypical histologic 
features. In a retrospective case series that included 79 patients with

appendiceal carcinoid (neuroendocrine) tumors, small-vessel invasion was 
a risk factor for metastases in patients with tumors <2 cm.115       
Patients with tumors >2 cm, or any tumor size with an incomplete 
resection or positive nodes/margins, are at significant risk for locoregional 
or distant metastases. These patients should be staged with multiphasic 
abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI scans with intravenous (IV) contrast. SSTR-
based imaging may be considered and if no distant disease is identified, a 
right hemicolectomy should be considered. Results from a systematic 
review and meta-analysis with 261 patients suggest that a right 
hemicolectomy was beneficial in appendiceal NETs >2 cm.116 Additionally, 
a small proportion of appendiceal NETs may also contain evidence of 
adenocarcinoma (ie, “adenocarcinoid” or “goblet cell carcinoid”). These 
tumors should be managed according to the NCCN Guidelines for Colon 
Cancer (available at www.NCCN.org). 
Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Rectum 
An analysis of the SEER database revealed that patients with NET tumors 
of the rectum had the best prognosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.87; 95% CI, 
1.76–1.98).109 The treatment of rectal lesions is based on the size of the 
primary tumor. For small (<1 cm) incidental lesions, complete endoscopic 
resection with negative margins may be sufficient, but for resection with 
indeterminate margins and low grade (G1), endoscopy at 6 to 12 months 
by endoscopy is recommended to assess for residual disease. If 
endoscopy results determine residual disease or intermediate grade after 
endoscopy, or if the small incidental tumors have indeterminate margins 
and intermediate grade (G2), the pathway for all other rectal tumors 
should be followed. All other rectal lesions should be staged using rectal 
MRI or endorectal ultrasound. If the lesion is ≤2 cm or minimally invasive 
(T1), endoscopic or transanal excision is recommended. Given the higher 
risk of invasion with larger tumors, examination under anesthesia and/or 
EUS with radical resection if there is invasion of the muscularis propria or 
node-positivity should be considered for tumors 1 to 2 cm in size before 
the procedure. A retrospective review found that metastases were present 
in 66% of 87 patients with well-differentiated rectal NETs of 11 to 19 
mm.117 
Tumors >2 cm or that are node positive, those with invasion of the 
muscularis propria (T2–T4), or those associated with lymph node 
metastases should be treated with low anterior resection or, in rare cases, 
an abdominoperineal resection.118 There may be a role for neoadjuvant or 
definitive chemoradiation in selected cases.119  
Surveillance of Resected Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Gastrointestinal 
Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2), Lung, and Thymus 
Surveillance of resected GI, lung, and thymic NETs should include 
complete patient history and physical (H&P) examination, imaging, and 
biochemical markers as clinically indicated. For those with resected lung 
or thymic NETs, surveillance CT imaging of the chest and abdomen is 
recommended (with pelvic imaging as clinically indicated). In patients with 
resected GI NETs, multiphasic abdomen, with or without pelvis, CT or an 
MRI scan is recommended (with chest imaging as clinically indicated). 
Most patients with resected NETs of the jejunum/ileum/colon; duodenum, 
rectum, lung, and thymus; and type 3 gNETs with normal gastrin levels 
should be reevaluated 12 weeks to 12 months after resection (earlier if the 
patient is symptomatic). After 1-year post-resection, follow-up should 
occur every 12 to 24 months for up to 10 years post-resection. After 10 
years, surveillance should be considered as clinically indicated. If initial 
scans are negative, the frequency of follow-up scans may decrease. For 
high-grade tumors, more frequent surveillance may be appropriate. 
For functional tumors, the Panel recommends a follow-up with biochemical 
markers as clinically indicated. 5-HIAA, a metabolite of serotonin, in a 
24-hour urine or plasma sample may also be considered as a biochemical 
marker in some cases, particularly in patients with metastatic small-

MS-12 
intestinal NETs. A systematic review and meta-analysis revealed a 
predictive role of urinary 5-HIAA for mortality.120 During monitoring of 
patients after treatment of a NET, decreasing levels of 5-HIAA indicate a 
response to treatment, whereas increasing or excessive concentration 
indicates that the treatment has not been successful. However, a patient 
with symptoms may still have a NET even if the concentration of 5-HIAA is 
normal. Diet and a variety of drugs can affect the 5-HIAA test. Therefore, 
patients should be advised not to eat avocados, bananas, cantaloupe, 
eggplant, pineapples, plums, tomatoes, hickory nuts/pecans, plantains, 
kiwi, dates, grapefruit, honeydew, or walnuts for 48 hours before the start 
of and during urine collection. Medications that can increase 5-HIAA 
include acetaminophen, ephedrine, diazepam, nicotine, glyceryl 
guaiacolate (an ingredient found in some cough medicines), and 
phenobarbital. 
SSTR-based imaging or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT scans 
are not routinely recommended for surveillance after definitive resection, 
but may be indicated to assess disease location and disease burden for 
comparison in cases of subsequent possible recurrence. 
In specific cases, follow-up recommendations for patients with resected GI 
NETs differ from the above general recommendations. For noninvasive 
duodenal nonfunctioning NETs, endoscopic surveillance is recommended 
every 3 to 12 months for the first year, and then annually thereafter. 
Routine endoscopic surveillance is recommended for noninvasive 
duodenal gastrinomas. For rectal tumors <1 cm and negative margins, 
prognosis is excellent and no follow-up is usually required. Follow-up 
endoscopies with rectal MRI or endorectal ultrasound are recommended 
for rectal tumors that are between 1 and 2 cm, 6 and 12 months after 
first-line therapy, and then as clinically indicated. 
For appendiceal tumors <1 cm, no surveillance is indicated. For tumors ≥1 
cm to ≤2 cm,121,122 the Panel recommends optional multiphasic imaging 
with contrast as surveillance every 2 to 5 years based on clinical 
pathologic features. Patients with small, well-differentiated appendiceal 
NETs are at very low risk for recurrence.123-125 In the setting of appendiceal 
NETs >2 cm, multiphasic CT or MRI of the abdomen with or without pelvis 
is recommended (with chest imaging as clinically indicated) 12 weeks to 
12 months post-resection and every 12 to 24 months thereafter for 10 
years.  
For patients with hypergastrinemic/type 1 gNETs, follow-up EGD is 
recommended at 1 year and then every 1 to 3 years thereafter. For 
patients with hypergastrinemic/type 2 gNETs, follow-up EGD is 
recommended at 1 year and then as clinically indicated for patients who 
underwent endoscopic resection. Because gastrin levels remain 
persistently high in patients with atrophic gastritis, gastrin levels are 
generally uninformative in patients with type 1 gNETs. After baseline 
gastrin, the Panel does not recommend following gastrin and 
chromogranin A levels for type 1 tumors. 
Evaluation of Locoregional Advanced Disease and/or Distant Metastatic 
Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2), Lung, and Thymic 
Neuroendocrine Tumors  
Imaging recommendations for patients suspected to have distant 
metastatic disease include multiphase technique CT or MRI at baseline 
and to assess disease progression.126,127 The most common sites of 
metastases from intestinal NETs include regional/mesenteric lymph 
nodes, liver, and bones. When evaluating locoregional advanced and/or 
metastatic NETs of the GI tract, lung, and thymus, or for suspected 
carcinoid syndrome, multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI scans with IV 
contrast are recommended. Chest CT scans with or without contrast are 
recommended as clinically indicated (without contrast is acceptable when 
evaluating for metastases from primary tumors in other sites).

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 
Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-13 
SSTR-based imaging, if not already done, is recommended to assess the 
baseline SSTR status of locoregional advanced and/or metastatic NETs of 
the GI tract, lung, or thymus. SSTR-based imaging should be repeated at 
the time of progressive disease on cross-sectional imaging. Additional 
indications for periodic SSTR-imaging may include monitoring of patients 
with bone-predominant disease and establishing a new baseline after 
completion of PRRT.  
If carcinoid syndrome is suspected, a baseline echocardiogram is 
recommended, along with a cardiology consultation if carcinoid heart 
disease (CHD) is present. The transthoracic echocardiogram should 
include morphologic evaluation of the valves (especially tricuspid and 
pulmonary) and a comprehensive assessment of the right heart size and 
function using two-dimensional color-flow and continuous wave Doppler 
assessment, and two-dimensional and color-flow assessment of the atrial 
septum with an agitated saline injection if valve disease is present to 
determine whether there is an atrial level shunt.128-130 The comprehensive 
assessment of the right-sided valves has two components: 1) tricuspid 
valve assessment using parasternal inflow, short axis, and apical 
4-chamber views; and 2) pulmonary valve assessment using parasternal 
outflow, short axis, and apical or subcoastal outflow views. Following valve 
replacement, patients should be followed with serial echocardiograms 
according to institutional practice. If the valves are abnormal by 
echocardiogram, consider the potential for clots requiring resumption of 
anticoagulants versus recurrent CHD. See Principles of Imaging in the 
algorithm for recommendations for repeat transthoracic echocardiogram 
for patients with NETs.  
Twenty-four-hour urine or plasma 5-HIAA may also be considered, and 
then repeated over time to monitor subsequent disease progression. As 
previously mentioned, if carcinoid syndrome is suspected, evaluation of 
serotonin secretion, using a 24-hour urine or plasma collection for 5-HIAA, 
is recommended. Lung and thymic tumors may also be associated with 
hypersecretion of ACTH that causes the development of Cushing 
syndrome;131 therefore, if clinically indicated, patients should be screened 
for Cushing syndrome. If Cushing syndrome is suspected, see discussion 
below [see Evaluation and Treatment of Hypercortisolemia (± Cushing 
Syndrome), below]. 
Management of Locoregional Advanced Disease and/or Distant Metastases 
of the Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2)  
Resection  
In some cases, patients with limited hepatic metastases or other sites of 
disease can undergo surgical cytoreduction of the primary tumor and 
metastases. If surgical cytoreduction of metastases is possible, the 
primary tumor, regional lymph nodes, and metastases should be resected. 
If complete surgical cytoreduction of metastases is not possible, the Panel 
recommends consideration of resection for the primary tumor and regional 
lymph node to reduce future obstruction, mesenteric ischemia, bleeding, 
or perforation, particularly if the patient is symptomatic; and/or octreotide 
LAR or lanreotide. Observation with serial imaging is an option if the 
patient has a low tumor burden. If the patient has clinically significant 
tumor burden, an alternative front-line therapy may be used. In select 
cases, it may be appropriate to proceed to front-line systemic therapy or 
locoregional therapy prior to or concurrently with octreotide LAR or 
lanreotide. A retrospective study did not find a survival improvement of 
resecting asymptomatic primary small bowel tumors.132 However, it is not 
uncommon for patients with small bowel primary tumors to experience 
symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain from episodic bowel obstruction 
or bowel ischemia related to the primary tumor and surrounding fibrosis. 
Palliative small bowel resection is recommended in these patients. 
Noncurative debulking surgery can also be considered in select cases,

especially if the patient is symptomatic either from tumor bulk or hormone 
production.   
In a long-term follow-up of 546 patients with well-differentiated NET 
(mostly small intestine and pancreas) liver metastases treated with 
cytoreductive hepatectomy from 2000 to 2020, the median OS and median 
PFS were 122 months and 17 months, respectively.133 One multi-
institutional analysis reported an improvement in the median (not reached 
vs. 87 months; P < .001) and 5-year survival (85.2% vs. 60.7%; P < .001) 
of patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases who underwent an R0/R1 
resection compared to those who underwent a debulking R2 procedure.134 
Primary tumors were in the pancreas, small intestine, and large intestine. 
Ninety-six percent of patients reported symptom relief (median 
symptom-free interval, 41 months). In another study, the median OS and 
PFS were 89.4 months and 22.5 months, respectively, in patients with 
GEP-NETs with liver metastases who underwent hepatic cytoreductive 
procedures.135 The authors report that >70% cytoreduction resulted in 
improved outcomes in terms of OS and PFS. In another study that used a 
liver debulking threshold of 70% in patients with NETs, the median PFS 
was 72 months and the disease-specific survival was 90%.136  
If resection is performed and long-term treatment with SSAs is anticipated, 
a prophylactic cholecystectomy can be considered given the association 
between long-term treatment with SSAs and the development of biliary 
symptoms and gallstones.137 
Control of Carcinoid Syndrome Symptoms and Related Complications 
Somatostatin Analogs 
Patients who have symptoms of carcinoid syndrome should be treated 
with octreotide LAR or lanreotide.137 The LAR formulation of octreotide is 
commonly used for the chronic management of symptoms in patients with 
carcinoid syndrome. Standard doses of octreotide LAR are 20 to 30 mg 
intramuscularly every 4 weeks. Higher doses have been shown to be 
safe.138-140 Therapeutic levels are not achieved for 10 to 14 days after LAR 
injection. Octreotide (100–250 mcg subcutaneously three times daily) can 
be considered for breakthrough symptoms.141-143  
Lanreotide has a similar mechanism of action as octreotide LAR, but is 
administered as a deep subcutaneous injection. The standard dose of 
lanreotide is 120 mg every 4 weeks. Several studies have shown it to be 
effective at controlling symptoms of hormone secretion in patients with GI 
NETs, gastrinomas, or tumors secreting vasoactive intestinal polypeptide 
(VIPomas).144-148 The multinational phase III ELECT trial randomized 115 
patients with carcinoid syndrome who were either naïve to or responsive 
to octreotide to receive 120 mg of lanreotide or placebo and evaluated the 
number of days patients required use of rescue octreotide.149 Patients in 
the lanreotide arm required less frequent rescue octreotide than those in 
the placebo arm (33.7% vs. 48.5%; P = .017). Overall, lanreotide 
treatment improved symptom control, irrespective of prior octreotide 
use.149,150 
If injection site-related complications occur, consider switching to another 
SSA. After clinical, symptomatic, or radiographic progression on standard 
SSA doses, for symptom and/or tumor control, above-label dosing 
octreotide LAR (up to 60 mg once a month) or lanreotide (up to 120 mg 
every 14 days) may be useful in select cases.138-140   
Telotristat 
If carcinoid syndrome is poorly controlled, telotristat may be considered as 
an additional therapy for persistent diarrhea after ruling out non-carcinoid 
syndrome causes. Patients should be evaluated for pancreatic exocrine 
deficiency and bile acid diarrhea. Telotristat or telotristat ethyl is a 
small-molecule tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) inhibitor, which decreases 
urinary 5-HIAA levels and the frequency of bowel movements (BMs) in

MS-15 
patients with carcinoid syndrome.151-154 It was approved by the FDA in 
February 2017 and the recommendation to use telotristat for persistent 
diarrhea in this context is based on the results of the TELESTAR study. 
The TELESTAR study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled phase III trial of 135 patients with metastatic NETs and 
a documented history of carcinoid syndrome, who were experiencing an 
average of ≥4 BMs a day while receiving stable-dose SSA therapy for at 
least 3 months prior to enrollment in the study.153 Patients were 
randomized to receive placebo, telotristat ethyl (250 mg), or telotristat 
ethyl (500 mg) in a 1:1:1 ratio three times per day orally for 12 weeks 
during a double-blind treatment period. From baseline to week 12, mean 
BM frequency reductions per day for placebo, telotristat ethyl (250 mg), 
and telotristat ethyl (500 mg) were -0.9, -1.7, and -2.1, respectively. In 
addition, both telotristat dosages significantly decreased mean urinary 
5-HIAA compared to placebo at week 12 (P < .001).153 Compared to 
placebo, treatment with telotristat at either dosage did not result in a 
statistically significant change in the number of observed flushing 
episodes; therefore, additional options should be considered to manage 
other symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome. In the TELEPRO 
and TELEPRO-II real-world study, patients given telotristat ethyl had a 
decrease in diarrhea and other carcinoid syndrome symptoms.154,155 
Results from the nonrandomized phase III TELEPATH study suggest that 
long-term use of telotristat ethyl in patients with carcinoid syndrome was 
well tolerated.156 Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 
45.2% of patients.  
Additional Considerations  
Other therapies that may be considered to achieve symptom control by 
reducing tumor burden include hepatic arterial embolization, cytoreductive 
surgery for liver-predominant disease, or other systemic therapy based on 
disease site.157 
In the setting of carcinoid syndrome, an echocardiogram should also be 
performed every 1 to 3 years or as clinically indicated for patients without 
CHD, and at least annually for patients with established CHD. Cardiac 
heart disease is frequent in patients with carcinoid syndrome; in one study, 
59% of patients with carcinoid syndrome were diagnosed with tricuspid 
regurgitation.158,159 A study of 250 patients with carcinoid syndrome 
showed that patients with 5-HIAA levels of ≥300 μmol (57 mg) over 24 
hours and with ≥3 flushing episodes per day were more likely to have 
CHD.160 To monitor disease control and/or progression, surveillance 
imaging with multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI every 12 weeks to 12 
months and chest CT scans (with or without contrast) should be performed 
as clinically indicated.  
Control of Tumor Growth 
For patients with locoregional advanced disease and/or distant 
metastases of the GI tract with clinically significant disease progression, 
cabozantinib (category 1 if prior treatment with everolimus or lutetium Lu 
177 dotatate), everolimus (category 1 for nonfunctional tumors), PRRT 
with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (if SSTR-positive and progression on 
octreotide LAR/lanreotide) (category 1 for progressive midgut tumors), 
octreotide LAR, and lanreotide are preferred regimens. Above-label dose 
octreotide LAR or lanreotide (for SSTR-positive disease and progression 
on standard SSA doses), consideration of RT with or without concurrent 
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for locally advanced unresectable 
disease (excluding small bowel mesenteric), and consideration of the 
cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens discussed below (category 3) are useful 
in certain circumstances. 
Somatostatin Analogs 
In patients with GI tract primary tumors who have clinically significant 
tumor burden or progressive disease, initiation of either octreotide LAR or 
lanreotide is recommended to potentially control tumor growth. Treatment

with octreotide LAR or lanreotide will likely be of greatest benefit in 
patients with SSTR-positive tumors. The recommendation for octreotide 
LAR in these patients is based on the results of the PROMID study, a 
placebo-controlled phase III trial of 85 patients with metastatic midgut 
NETs (proliferative index, Ki-67, ≤2%), which showed median times to 
tumor progression of 14.3 and 6 months in the octreotide LAR and 
placebo groups, respectively (P = .000072).161 After 6 months of 
treatment, stable disease was observed in 66.7% of patients in the 
octreotide LAR group and in 37.2% of patients in the placebo group. 
Results of long-term survival of patients in the PROMID study found that 
median OS was not significantly different between the arms (83.7 months 
in the placebo arm and 84.7 months in the octreotide arm; HR, 0.83; 95% 
CI, 0.44–1.46; P = .51).162 However, post-study treatment included 
octreotide LAR in 38 of 43 patients in the placebo arm, possibly 
confounding interpretation of long-term survival results. 
The recommendation for lanreotide for control of tumor growth in patients 
with clinically significant tumor burden or progressive disease is based on 
results of the CLARINET study. The CLARINET study randomized 204 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonfunctioning pancreatic or 
intestinal NETs (proliferative index, Ki-67, ≤10%) to receive either 
lanreotide or placebo and followed patients for PFS. Results from this trial 
showed that treatment with lanreotide for 2 years resulted in an 
improvement in PFS over placebo (PFS, not reached vs. 18 months; HR, 
0.47; 95% CI, 0.30–0.73; P < .001).163 Subsequent data from a pre-
planned interim analysis of the open-label extension of the CLARINET 
study estimated PFS in patients treated with lanreotide at 32.8 months 
(95% CI, 30.9–68.0).164 The difference in the reported median PFS 
between the PROMID and CLARINET studies is likely explained by a 
difference in the study populations, as the majority of the patients enrolled 
in the CLARINET trial had stable disease in the 3 to 6 months before 
randomization.163  
Higher (above-label) doses of SSAs may also have activity in patients with 
progression on standard doses. The phase II CLARINET FORTE study, 
which enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic grade 1/2 
midgut NETs or PanNETs with progression on lanreotide (120 mg every 
28 days), demonstrated that a reduction in the dosing interval was 
feasible.140 The median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI, 5.6–11.1) in 
patients with midgut NETs treated with lanreotide at a dose of 120 mg 
every 14 days for up to 96 weeks. The long-term efficacy and safety of 
lanreotide was demonstrated in a 48-week phase II trial with Japanese 
patients with NETs.165 Stable disease was observed in 71.4% of patients 
while progressive disease was observed in 21.4% of patients. Patients in 
the control arms of the NETTER-1 and NETTER-2 trials received high-
dose octreotide LAR (60 mg every 4 weeks).138,139,166 In the NETTER-1 
trial, the estimated rate of PFS at 20 months was 65.2%, with a response 
rate of 3% and a median OS of 36.3 months in patients with advanced 
SSTR-positive midgut NETs treated with octreotide LAR.138,166 In the 
NETTER-2 trial, the median PFS was 8.5 months in patients with well-
differentiated grade 2–3 SSTR-positive GEP-NETs treated with first-line 
high-dose octreotide LAR.139 
Everolimus for Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors of the 
Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
For patients with GI NETs with clinically significant disease progression, 
everolimus (category 1 for nonfunctional GI NETs) is a recommended 
treatment option. However, the effectiveness of everolimus in the 
treatment of patients with carcinoid syndrome has not been established. 
Everolimus is an inhibitor of mTOR and was well tolerated and showed 
evidence of antitumor effect in patients with advanced NETs when given 
with octreotide LAR in a phase II trial.167 In the randomized phase III 
RADIANT-2 trial, 429 patients with advanced NETs and carcinoid 
syndrome were randomized to receive octreotide LAR with everolimus or 
placebo.168 Based on central review, patients receiving octreotide plus

MS-17 
everolimus had a median PFS of 16.4 months, compared with 11.3 
months for patients receiving octreotide alone (P = .026). This difference 
in the primary endpoint of PFS did not, however, meet the predefined 
threshold for statistical significance. An open-label extension of the 
RADIANT-2 trial allowed patients who had progressed or completed the 
double-blind core phase to take everolimus plus octreotide LAR. The 
median OS was not statistically different for patients receiving everolimus 
plus octreotide LAR (29.2 months) or placebo plus octreotide LAR (during 
the open-label extension; 35.2 months) at the final cutoff date.169 Adverse 
events associated with everolimus included stomatitis, rash, fatigue, and 
diarrhea.168,169 Other side effects have also been described.170-172  
A subsequent trial, RADIANT-4, was an international, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that randomized 302 patients with 
progressive, non-functional lung or GI NETs 2:1 to receive everolimus or 
placebo.173 In contrast to RADIANT-2, patients in RADIANT-4 were not 
receiving an SSA at the time of study enrollment and concurrent SSA was 
not a study requirement. Median PFS was 11.0 months (95% CI, 9.2–
13.3) in the everolimus arm and 3.9 months (95% CI, 3.6–7.4) in the 
placebo arm. The HR for progression or death was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.35–
0.67; P < .001). Drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events included stomatitis 
(9% vs. 0%), infections (7% vs. 0%), diarrhea (7% vs. 2%), anemia (4% 
vs. 1%), fatigue (3% vs. 1%), and hyperglycemia (3% vs. 0%). A real-
world report highlights the outcomes of 169 pretreated patients with 
advanced NETs of the pancreas (n = 85) or other sites (n = 84) who 
received everolimus through a compassionate use program.174 An 
increased risk of adverse events in patients who had received previous 
radiolabeled peptide therapy or chemotherapy was noted. An exploratory 
analysis of a subgroup of patients with advanced, progressive, 
well-differentiated, non-functional lung NETs from RADIANT-4 reported 
improved PFS by central review (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28–0.88) in the 
everolimus arm (9.2 months) compared to the placebo arm (3.6 
months).175 Additionally, a secondary endpoint analysis of RADIANT-4 
found that health-related quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes were maintained 
in patients receiving everolimus and placebo, with no significant difference 
between them.176 
Cabozantinib for Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors of the 
Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
Cabozantinib (category 1 if prior treatment with everolimus or lutetium Lu 
177 dotatate) is an option for patients with GI NETs, having demonstrated 
efficacy in the phase III CABINET trial in patients with progressive well-
differentiated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic or extrapancreatic 
NETs.177 Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive cabozantinib or 
placebo. In the extrapancreatic cohort, the median PFS was 8.4 months in 
the cabozantinib arm and 3.9 months in the placebo arm (stratified HR for 
progression or death, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.25–0.59; P < .001). Patients who 
received cabozantinib had an overall response rate (ORR) of 5% (vs. 0% 
with placebo) and a median OS of 21.9 months (vs. 19.7 months with 
placebo; HR, 0.86). Sixty-two percent of patients in the cabozantinib arm 
had a grade 3–5 adverse event possibly related to treatment, compared to 
27% of patients in the placebo arm.  
Cytotoxic Chemotherapy for Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors of 
the Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
The benefits associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with 
advanced GI NETs appear, at best, to be modest. Tumor response rates 
are generally low, and no PFS benefit has been clearly demonstrated.178  
Other Agents for Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors of the 
Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
Capecitabine was tested in patients with metastatic NETs in a phase II 
trial; no objective responses were reported, although 13 of 19 patients 
were reported to have experienced stable disease.179 Treatment with

MS-18 
FOLFOX resulted in a partial response (PR) rate of 12.5% in patients with 
advanced small intestine NETs, 14% in those with advanced gNETs, and 
17% in those with advanced rectal NETs.180 Responses to temozolomide 
in advanced NETs are rare.181 
A phase II trial assessed bevacizumab plus capecitabine and included 49 
patients with advanced and/or metastatic GI NETs.182 A PFS of 23.4 
months was reported, with 18% of patients achieving a PR and 70% 
achieving stable disease. Similar results were seen in two small trials of 
FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) and CAPEOX 
(capecitabine and oxaliplatin) combined with bevacizumab where a PFS of 
19.3 months and 16.7 months, respectively, was reported.183 However, 
these findings have not been confirmed in phase III studies. 
The Panel lists cytotoxic chemotherapy (namely 5-FU, capecitabine, 
dacarbazine, oxaliplatin, and temozolomide) for progressive NETs of the 
GI tract as a category 3 recommendation. While some panelists believe 
the toxicity of systemic therapy does not warrant its widespread use in this 
population, others believe that it is an important alternative for patients 
without other options for treatment.  
Radiolabeled Somatostatin Analogs for Advanced Neuroendocrine 
Tumors of the Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2 
NETs) 
Several early studies initially reported that treatment with radiolabeled 
SSAs was associated with tumor responses in patients with advanced 
NETs.184-188 A prospective phase II study of radiopeptide therapy in 90 
patients with metastatic NETs refractory to octreotide showed that 
treatment was associated with improvement in symptoms; radiographic 
regression, however, was relatively uncommon.189 Numerous large, 
non-randomized cohort analyses have also reported encouraging survival 
rates with this approach.190-192 
The phase III NETTER-1 study randomized 229 patients with advanced 
midgut NETs to receive treatment with either lutetium Lu 177 dotatate with 
octreotide LAR or high-dose octreotide. Results of this study showed that 
treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate was associated with a significant 
improvement in PFS (not reached vs. 8.4 months; P < .0001).166 Objective 
tumor responses were observed in 18% of patients who received lutetium 
Lu 177 dotatate versus 3% in the control group (P < .001). However, data 
from the final analysis showed that treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate 
did not result in a significant improvement in median OS (lutetium Lu 177 
dotatate, 48.0 months; high-dose octreotide, 36.3 months; HR, 0.84; P = 
.30).138 Results from a long-term phase II study that enrolled patients with 
advanced GI NETs determined that the median OS and PFS were 71.0 
months and 59.8 months, respectively, in patients who received PRRT 
with 177Lu-DOTA-octreotate (18.5 Gbq), and 97.6 months and 59.8 
months, respectively, in patients who received a 27.5 Gbq dosage.193  
PRRT with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is approved by the FDA for the 
treatment of adult and pediatric patients ≥12 years of age with 
SSTR-positive unresectable, low- or intermediate-grade, locally advanced 
or metastatic GEP-NETs.194 Treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is a 
recommended option for patients with unresectable GI NETs with SSTR-
positive tumors and clinically significant disease progression on octreotide 
LAR or lanreotide (category 1 for progressive mid-gut tumors).  
More recently, the NETTER-2 study enrolled patients with advanced high 
risk SSTR+ GEP-NET (Ki-67 index 10%–55%) in the first-line setting.139 A 
total of 226 patients were randomized 2:1 to lutetium Lu 177 dotatate plus 
octreotide LAR or octreotide LAR 60 mg/month in the first-line setting. The 
median Ki-67 index was 16% (range 12%–25%), 65% had G2 disease, 
and 46% had a GI primary. The primary endpoint was PFS by central 
review, which was 22.8 months (95% CI, 19.4 months–not estimated) in 
the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate group and 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.7–13.8) in

MS-19 
the control arm (P < .0001). Consistent benefit was observed across all 
subgroups, including G2 versus G3, pancreas versus non-pancreas 
versus small intestine primary, providing additional support for PRRT in GI 
NETs. OS data were not mature at the time of the analysis. Time to 
deterioration in QOL was similar in both groups. One case of 
myelodysplasia was noted in the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate plus octreotide 
LAR group, although further follow-up is needed to fully assess long-term 
safety.  
Please see Principles of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy with 
lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in the algorithm for practical guidance and 
information, including patient eligibility, patient preparation for treatment, 
dose and administration of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, post-treatment 
instructions, and timing of SSAs.  
Use of Somatostatin Analogs with Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate  
Most patients treated with PRRT will have progressed on first-line SSA 
treatment. Patients with hormonally functional tumors should continue 
octreotide LAR or lanreotide along with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. It is 
unclear whether patients with nonfunctional tumors benefit from 
continuation of SSA treatment during and after lutetium Lu 177 dotatate 
treatment. The Panel recommends discontinuing treatment with octreotide 
LAR or lanreotide for nonfunctional tumors if there is clinically significant 
disease progression. A recent study looked at whether 68Ga-DOTATATE 
uptake before or after long-acting SSA treatment was affected in patients 
with NETs and found that the uptake in the primary tumor and metastatic 
sites were not compromised.96 However, there are still theoretical 
concerns regarding the competition between SSAs and lutetium Lu 177 
dotatate for SSTR binding. SSA treatment interruption may not be 
necessary, but the Panel recommends the following adjustments. 
Concomitant use of long-acting SSAs is not recommended in the 4 weeks 
prior to each treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. Additionally, short-
acting SSAs should be stopped 24 hours before each lutetium Lu 177 
dotatate treatment. SSAs (short- and long-acting) can be resumed 4 to 24 
hours after each lutetium Lu 177 dotatate treatment. IV infusion of amino 
acids is a critical part of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate therapy for 
nephroprotection.  
Locoregional Therapies for Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Gastrointestinal 
Tract (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
For patients with locoregional advanced, liver-predominant, progressive 
disease or patients with poorly controlled carcinoid syndrome, liver-
directed therapies are recommended (see Principles of Liver-Directed 
Therapy for Neuroendocrine Tumor Metastases in the algorithm), mainly 
with the palliative goals of extending life and relieving hormonal 
symptoms.195-198  
Cytoreductive surgery or ablative therapies such as radiofrequency 
ablation (RFA) or cryoablation may be considered if near-complete 
treatment of tumor burden can be achieved.199-203 Ablative therapy in this 
setting is non-curative. Data on the use of these interventions are 
emerging. For unresectable liver metastases, liver-directed therapy (bland 
transarterial embolization [TAE],204 transarterial chemoembolization 
[TACE],205-207 or transarterial radioembolization [TARE]207-211) is 
recommended. Objective radiologic response rates vary widely in 
retrospective studies, but ranges from 11% to 100% (TAE/TACE) and 22% 
to 71% (TARE), with symptom palliation in approximately 39% to 95% of 
patients with hormonal syndromes.212-214 The results of one systematic 
review, encompassing 101 studies and 5545 patients with NENs treated 
with liver embolization, revealed a pooled response rate of 37% and 
symptom control in approximately 55% of patients.212 The median PFS 
was 18 months. No single modality of embolization therapy has been 
shown to be superior to another, but there is a difference in both long-term 
and short-term toxicities among the different modalities. Relative

contraindications include significant baseline liver dysfunction (eg, 
jaundice, ascites) and a liver tumor burden >70%. Prior Whipple surgery 
or biliary instrumentation (ie, sphincterotomy, stent) increases the risk of 
liver abscess due to biliary bacterial colonization; infectious complications 
occur in about 20% of patients following TAE/TACE and 8% after TARE, 
even with broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage.215  
For GI NETs, additional locoregional therapy options include consideration 
of RT, with or without concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, 
for locally advanced unresectable disease (excluding small bowel 
mesenteric), and palliative RT for oligometastatic disease and/or 
symptomatic metastases (excluding mesenteric masses). See Principles 
of Radiation Therapy in the algorithm for additional details. 
Liver Transplantation Considered Investigational for Liver Metastases of 
Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated 
Grade 1/2) 
Several reviews have now reported the results of liver transplantation 
patients with NETs whose metastases are confined to the liver.216-219 
Results from a multicenter database of 85 patients at 28 centers who 
underwent liver transplantation for NETs were also reported.220 A 
meta-analysis showed that, while 5-year survival rates are encouraging, 
the majority of patients undergoing liver transplantation ultimately develop 
recurrence.221 The Panel acknowledged the considerable associated risks 
and deemed liver transplantation to be investigational and not part of 
routine care at this time. 
Management of Locoregional Unresectable Disease or Distant Metastatic 
Lung or Thymic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Atypical and Typical Carcinoid 
Tumors) 
Lung NETs include a spectrum from low-grade typical NETs to 
intermediate-grade atypical NETs.222 First-line therapy options for 
locoregional unresectable low-grade disease (typical carcinoid) include 
observation (if asymptomatic), everolimus, octreotide LAR or lanreotide (if 
SSTR-positive and/or has hormonal symptoms), temozolomide with or 
without capecitabine, or RT. First-line therapy options for locoregional 
unresectable intermediate-grade disease (atypical carcinoid) include 
observation (if asymptomatic and non-progressive); cytotoxic 
chemotherapy with cisplatin with etoposide, carboplatin etoposide, or 
temozolomide with or without capecitabine; everolimus; octreotide LAR or 
lanreotide (if SSTR-positive and/or has hormonal symptoms); or RT with 
or without concurrent cisplatin with etoposide or carboplatin with 
etoposide. Subsequent therapy for either low-grade or intermediate-grade 
disease includes clinical trial (preferred), cabozantinib (category 1 if prior 
treatment with everolimus), consideration of an alternate primary therapy, 
or consideration of PRRT with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (if SSTR-positive 
and progression on octreotide LAR/lanreotide).  
For patients with distant metastases who are asymptomatic with low tumor 
burden and low-grade disease (typical carcinoid), observation (with chest 
CT with contrast and multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI every 3 to 6 
months) or octreotide LAR or lanreotide (if SSTR-positive and/or has 
hormonal symptoms) are recommended. For patients with distant 
metastases, a clinical trial is preferred for patients with clinically significant 
tumor burden and low-grade (typical carcinoid) disease, evidence of 
disease progression, intermediate-grade (atypical carcinoid) disease, or 
symptomatic disease. Observation can be considered in select patients 
with low burden of disease and favorable prognostic features (with chest 
CT scans with contrast and multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI scans 
every 3 to 6 months). If systemic therapy is indicated, cabozantinib 
(category 1 if prior treatment with everolimus), everolimus (category 1 for 
nonfunctional lung NETs), and octreotide LAR or lanreotide (if SSTR+ 
tumor and/or hormonal symptoms) are preferred regimens. Carboplatin + 
etoposide, cisplatin + etoposide, PRRT with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (if

SSTR-positive and progression on octreotide LAR or lanreotide), 
temozolomide with or without capecitabine, and above-label dose 
octreotide LAR or lanreotide (for SSTR-positive disease and/or hormonal 
symptoms and progression on standard SSA doses) (category 2B) are 
considered useful in certain circumstances. Liver-directed therapy for 
liver-predominant disease is also an option. See Principles of Liver-
Directed Therapy for Neuroendocrine Tumor Metastases in the algorithm. 
For symptom control, the addition of focal therapy, such as radiation, 
endobronchial therapy, or ablation, can be considered. 
Somatostatin Analogs  
Patients can be considered for treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide 
if the tumor is SSTR-positive and/or associated with hormonal symptoms. 
No clear consensus exists on the timing of octreotide or lanreotide 
initiation in asymptomatic patients with metastatic NETs and low tumor 
burden. Although initiation of octreotide LAR or lanreotide is an option in 
these patients, deferring initiation until evidence of tumor progression is 
seen may also be appropriate in selected patients. In patients with 
SSTR-positive disease and /or hormonal symptoms, after clinical, 
symptomatic, or radiographic progression on standard SSA doses, for 
symptom and/or tumor control, above-label dosing octreotide LAR (up to 
60 mg once a month) or lanreotide (up to 120 mg every 14 days) may be 
useful in select cases.138-140,223   
Everolimus  
The RADIANT-4 double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial 
randomized 302 patients with progressive, non-functional lung or GI NETs 
2:1 to receive everolimus or placebo.173 As previously described, patients 
were not receiving an SSA at the time of study enrollment and concurrent 
SSA was not a study requirement. Overall, 90/302 patients had a lung 
primary (N = 63 in the everolimus arm and N = 27 in the placebo arm). 
The median PFS was 11.0 months (95% CI, 9.2–13.3) in the everolimus 
arm and 3.9 months (95% CI, 3.6–7.4) in the placebo arm. Overall, the HR 
for progression or death was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.35–0.67; P < .00001). An 
exploratory analysis of a subgroup of patients with lung NETs reported 
improved PFS by central review (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28–0.88) in the 
everolimus arm (9.2 months) compared to the placebo arm (3.6 
months).175 The phase 3 RADIANT-2 trial in patients with carcinoid 
syndrome included 44/429 patients with lung NETs, including nine with 
atypical carcinoids.224 This study did not stratify according to the type of 
tumor; 33 patients received octreotide LAR + everolimus and 11 patients 
received octreotide LAR + placebo. Median PFS by central review was 
13.63 (95% CI, 5.55–14.29) months in the everolimus plus octreotide LAR 
group and 5.59 (95% CI, 2.79–27.76) months in the placebo plus 
octreotide LAR group (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.31–1.68), although this did not 
meet the prespecified boundary (one-sided log-rank test P = .228). Taken 
together, the data suggest that everolimus is a reasonable treatment 
option for patients with lung/thymic NETs with clinically significant tumor 
burden, disease progression, and/or intermediate grade (atypical 
carcinoid) (category 1 for nonfunctional tumors). 
Cabozantinib 
Cabozantinib is an option for those with advanced lung/thymic NETs with 
clinically significant tumor burden and low-grade disease (typical 
carcinoid), evidence of disease progression, intermediate-grade disease 
(atypical carcinoid), or symptomatic disease (category 1 if prior treatment 
with everolimus). Cabozantinib demonstrated efficacy in the phase III 
CABINET trial in patients with progressive, well-differentiated, locally 
advanced or metastatic pancreatic or extrapancreatic NETs.177 In the 
extrapancreatic NET cohort, lung/thymic NETs accounted for 33/134 
patients in the cabozantinib arm and 16//69 patients in the placebo arm. 
The median PFS was 8.4 months in the cabozantinib arm and 3.9 months 
in the placebo arm (stratified HR for progression or death, 0.38; 95% CI,

Temozolomide either administered alone or in combination with 
capecitabine is an option to manage tumor burden and any associated 
symptoms in patients with lung/thymic NETs.111,225 In a retrospective study 
of 31 patients with progressive metastatic bronchial NETs, temozolomide 
monotherapy was associated with PRs in 14% of patients.225 A small 
retrospective study examined the combination of temozolomide and 
capecitabine in patients with advanced lung NETs. The results showed an 
ORR of 30%, with a median OS of 68 months (95% CI, 35.3 months–
100.7 months) and a median PFS of 13 months (95% CI, 4.4 months–21.6 
months).226 Another study comprising 33 patients with advanced 
pulmonary carcinoids treated with temozolomide and capecitabine 
reported a median OS of 30.4 months and a median PFS of 9.0 months.227 
Carboplatin/etoposide,111,228 cisplatin/etoposide,111,228,229 or 
temozolomide225 with or without capecitabine,226,227 can be considered for 
intermediate-grade (atypical tumors) disease with Ki-67 proliferative index 
and mitotic index in the higher end of the defined spectrum.111  
PRRT with Lutetium Lu 177 Dotatate  
Treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is also a recommended option for 
patients with SSTR+ lung or thymic distant metastatic NETs with disease 
progression on octreotide LAR or lanreotide. A tumor is deemed to be 
SSTR-positive if the uptake in measurable lesions is greater than the liver. 
While prospective randomized studies are lacking, a meta-analysis of 18 
studies with 1920 patients with unresectable metastatic GEP-NETs and 
lung NETs treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate PRRT found a pooled 
disease response rate of 29% to 31% and a combined disease control rate 
of 74% to 81%.194 Another study examined the long-term efficacy, survival, 
and toxicity of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in a group of 610 Dutch patients 
with metastatic GEP-NETs and bronchial NETs.230 PFS and OS for all 
patients were 29 months (95% CI, 26–33 months) and 63 months (95% 
CI, 55–72 months), respectively. Other studies noted OS (58.8 months, n 
= 114)231 and median PFS (20.1 months in patients with typical bronchial 
carcinoid and 15.7 months in patients with atypical bronchial carcinoid; n = 
34)232 with PRRT treatment.233  
DIPNECH 
Although rare, some patients may present with multiple lung nodules or 
tumorlets and widespread peripheral airway neuroendocrine cell 
hyperplasia. In this case, a diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic pulmonary 
neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) can be made.222 This 
condition is generally indolent, and patients can be observed with chest 
CT scans without contrast every 12 to 24 months or as clinically indicated. 
If chronic cough/dyspnea is not responsive to inhalers or conventional 
treatment, a trial of octreotide LAR or lanreotide for symptom control is a 
recommended option.234,235 Patients should potentially be referred to 
pulmonary specialists for the management of symptoms. 
Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Pancreas (Well-Differentiated Grade 
1/2) 
According to a population-based study, malignant PanNETs account for 
approximately 1% of pancreatic cancers by incidence and 10% of 
pancreatic cancers by prevalence.236 Although the peak incidence of 
occurrence is between ages 40 and 69 years, a significant number of 
patients diagnosed with PanNETs are <35 years and the incidence is 
rising over time.236,237 Based on an analysis of PanNETs in the SEER 
database from 1973 to 2000, the annual incidence per 1 million was 1.8 in 
females and 2.6 in males.58 In an analysis of the SEER database from 
2000 to 2016, the overall incidence of PanNETs during this time frame 
was 0.61 per 100 000 person-years.238 An estimated 40% to 91% of 
PanNETs are nonfunctional. The remainder manifest with clinically evident

hormonal symptoms.14,58 Consistent with these numbers, analysis of the 
NCCN NETs Outcomes Database found that 22% of patients with 
PanNETs have a hormonal syndrome.84 Of these functioning tumors, 
≤70% are insulinomas, and only 10% are associated with metastases. 
Approximately 15% are glucagonomas. Gastrinomas and 
somatostatinomas account for another 10%; gastrinomas and 
somatostatinomas (80%–90%) are associated with a relatively high risk for 
metastases.237 The remaining rare PanNETs include VIPoma and 
cholecystokinin-producing tumors.239 
PanNETs are most commonly sporadic, but emerging data suggest 
germline mutations are present in ≤17% of patients.78,79 PanNETs 
occurring in patients with MEN1 syndrome are typically multiple and 
require different treatment strategies from those used for patients with 
sporadic PanNETs, which are usually solitary (see MEN1, below). 
Gastrinoma and insulinoma are the most common PanNETs in patients 
with MEN1.240 PanNETs can also occur in patients with germline 
mutations in MEN4, VHL, and other genes.241 See the Principles of 
Hereditary Cancer Risk Assessment and Genetic Counseling in the 
algorithm.  
Evaluation of Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Pancreas (Well-Differentiated 
Grade 1/2) 
The recommended evaluation includes a multiphasic abdomen CT or MRI 
scan (with or without pelvis). A chest CT scan with or without contrast may 
be included as appropriate. SSTR-based imaging and EUS can also be 
considered if additional imaging is needed.242 Consideration of genetic 
counseling and testing for inherited genetic syndromes is recommended 
for all patients with PanNETs. Personal and family history should also be 
evaluated in all patients with PanNETs for the possibility of MEN1 (see 
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, below) or other hereditary syndromes as 
appropriate. 
Hormone-secreting tumors, even when very small, may result in significant 
clinical symptoms, and lesion identification can be difficult.243 These cases 
often require additional imaging, such as EUS and SSTR-based imaging. 
Because many PanNETs secrete hormones, biochemical evaluation 
should also be considered in patients with PanNETs.237 Biochemical 
evaluation is generally guided by the presence of symptoms that might 
indicate excess hormone secretion. Screening for hormones in 
asymptomatic individuals is not routinely recommended. The range of 
symptoms associated with hormonal secretion is diverse. Classic 
syndromes include those associated with insulinomas, which secrete 
insulin, resulting in fasting or nocturnal hypoglycemia. Gastrinomas 
secrete gastrin, and patients often present with recurrent peptic ulcers. 
Glucagonomas are associated with the development of hyperglycemia or 
diabetes mellitus and/or migratory necrolytic erythema. Patients with 
somatostatinomas may also present with hyperglycemia or diabetes 
mellitus and/or diarrhea/steatorrhea. VIPomas are characterized by watery 
diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome) from 
secretion of VIP. The guidelines describe appropriate tests for each of 
these situations.  
Chromogranin A levels are elevated in ≥60% of patients with either 
functioning or nonfunctioning pancreatic endocrine tumors.244-246 Levels 
elevated to twice the normal limit or higher are associated with shorter 
survival times for patients with metastatic NETs (HR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9–4.0; 
P < .001).247 Chromogranin A was also found to be a prognostic factor in a 
prospective study of patients treated with everolimus.248 However, care 
should be taken in measuring chromogranin A and interpreting the results, 
because spuriously elevated levels of chromogranin A have been reported 
in patients using PPIs, those with renal or liver failure, those with 
hypertension, and those with chronic gastritis.

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-24 
Evaluation of Gastrinomas 
Gastrinoma should be suspected in patients with severe and refractory 
gastroduodenal ulcers or symptoms such as dyspepsia, usually 
accompanied by diarrhea. Evaluation of a patient with suspected 
gastrinoma includes measurement of serum gastrin levels.249 Diagnosis of 
gastrinoma can be confounded by the concurrent use of PPIs, which will 
elevate serum gastrin levels. Importantly, most patients who are found to 
have an elevated level of serum gastrin do not have a gastrinoma but 
have achlorhydria or are receiving PPIs or antacids. To confirm diagnosis, 
serum gastrin levels should ideally be checked when fasting and after the 
patient is off PPI therapy for >1 week.250 However, PPIs or H2 blockers 
should be continued in patients with overt clinical symptoms of gastrinoma 
and/or risks of complications. Genetic counseling and testing for inherited 
genetic syndromes is recommended. 
Imaging with multiphasic abdomen, with or without pelvis, CT or MRI scan 
with IV contrast is recommended. Other tests, such as SSTR-based 
imaging, chest CT scan with or without contrast, EUS, and other 
biochemical tests may be performed as appropriate. Approximately 70% of 
patients with MEN1 and gastrinoma have tumors situated in the 
duodenum. 
Evaluation of Insulinomas 
Insulinomas should be suspected in people who have hypoglycemia 
(generally fasting or nocturnal) and a pancreatic mass. However, some 
insulinomas can be small and not visible on imaging and so should be 
suspected in persons presenting with hypoglycemia. Evaluation with a 
72-hour fast, which tests serum insulin, pro-insulin, and C-peptide during 
concurrent hypoglycemia, is the gold standard.251 An insulin level >3 
mcIU/mL (usually >6 mcIU/mL), C-peptide concentrations of at least 0.6 
ng/mL, and proinsulin levels of ≥5 pmol/L when fasting blood glucose is 
<55 mg/dL is suspicious for insulinoma.251 The Panel also recommends 
evaluating fasting blood glucose levels if clinically feasible. Other 
biochemical tests may be performed as appropriate. Other causes of 
hypoglycemia, such as adrenal insufficiency and malnutrition, and other 
causes of non–insulin-mediated hypoglycemia should be ruled out prior to 
performing a 72-hour fast. The Endocrine Society Guidelines on 
Hypoglycemia have details regarding the general workup for 
hypoglycemia.251  
Imaging with multiphasic abdomen, with or without pelvis, CT with contrast 
or MRI is recommended to localize insulinomas. Some insulinomas are 
too small to be imaged with CT or MRI, and in those cases EUS can be 
useful. If imaging is negative, then insulinomas can often be localized by 
injecting calcium into selective pancreatic arteries and measuring the 
insulin levels in the right (usually) or left hepatic vein (Imamura-Doppman 
procedure).252 Most experts recommend this test only for patients with 
persistent or recurrent insulin-mediated hypoglycemia and when other 
localization tests are equivocal or negative.  
Ninety percent of insulinomas pursue an indolent course and can be cured 
surgically. To rule out metastatic disease, chest CT scans with or without 
contrast and SSTR-based imaging can also be done. However, 
insulinomas are less consistently octreotide-avid than other PanNETs, and 
SSTR-based imaging may consequently be less useful as an imaging 
technique in insulinomas than in other tumor subtypes. Genetic counseling 
and testing for inherited genetic syndromes should be considered. 
Evaluation of Glucagonomas and VIPomas 
For patients with recent-onset diabetes, cachexia, and/or a necrolytic 
erythematous skin rash and a pancreatic mass, the Panel recommends a 
blood test for glucagon and blood glucose. For suspected VIPomas with 
characteristic watery diarrhea, testing for VIP and electrolytes is 
recommended. For both glucagonomas and VIPomas, multiphasic

MS-25 
abdomen, with or without pelvis CT or MRI scans with IV contrast is 
recommended to identify the primary tumors. Chest CT scans with or 
without contrast can be performed. SSTR-based imaging and EUS can be 
performed as appropriate if the tumor is not able to be localized or there is 
concern for metastatic disease. Biochemical evaluation can be performed 
as clinically indicated. Genetic counseling and testing for inherited genetic 
syndromes should be considered. 
Treatment of Locoregional Resectable Neuroendocrine Tumors of the 
Pancreas (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
Resection is the first-line treatment approach for localized PanNETs when 
possible, and can result in excellent outcomes. Exceptions to surgery 
include patients with other life-limiting comorbidities or high surgical risk, 
particularly if tumors are small and indolent. There is no established role 
for adjuvant therapy, although there is an ongoing randomized clinical trial 
exploring the utility of chemotherapy after resection (NCT05040360). 
Non-operative Management 
Most patients with localized PanNETs should undergo surgical resection 
(including pancreatectomy or enucleation in select cases), absent any 
contraindications. Exceptions include patients with other life-limiting 
comorbidities, high surgical risk, or widely metastatic disease. Additionally, 
several studies have suggested that patients with incidentally discovered 
tumors <1 cm in size may be safely followed in some cases, depending on 
the site of the tumor.253,254 Other studies, including an analysis of the 
SEER database, suggest that some small tumors (measuring <2 cm in 
size in these studies) can pursue a more aggressive course.255-257 Other 
studies suggest that nonoperative management can be safe for small 
nonfunctioning PanNETs.258-261 Based on these limited data, the Panel 
recommends observation for small nonfunctioning tumors that are ≤1 cm. 
See PanNET-11 in the algorithm for more information. For tumors >1 cm 
to ≤2 cm, observation alone can be considered for selected cases of 
incidentally discovered, low-grade non-functional PanNETs.  
Consideration of belzutifan is also an option for the very uncommon 
situation of resectable tumors in the setting of germline VHL alteration. 
Belzutifan is an oral, hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (HIF-2 alpha) 
inhibitor that was approved by the FDA in 2021 for the treatment of adults 
with VHL disease-associated tumors that do not require immediate 
surgery (renal cell carcinoma, central nervous system hemangioblastomas 
or PanNETs). A phase II study evaluated belzutifan in 61 patients with 
germline VHL alterations with localized/nonmetastatic renal cell carcinoma 
with germline VHL disease-associated tumors in other organ systems.262 
The study excluded patients with prior systemic anticancer therapy, 
including anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy, patients 
needing immediate surgical intervention for tumor treatment, or patients 
with evidence of metastatic disease on screening imaging, but included 
patients with PanNETs and central nervous system hemangioblastomas. 
Treatment with belzutifan resulted in an ORR of 91% in 22 patients with 
PanNETs, as assessed by an independent review committee using 
RECIST, version 1.1. Fourteen percent of patients achieved a complete 
response (CR). The median time to response and median duration of 
response for these patients were 5.5 months (range, 2.5 months–16.4 
months) and not reached (range, 2.9+ months–22.3+ months), 
respectively, with responses still ongoing at the time to data cutoff (median 
follow-up of 21.8 months [range, 20.2 months–30.1 months] for all 
patients). The most common grade 3 adverse events were anemia (8%), 
hypertension (8%), and fatigue (5%) across all patients. A follow-up report 
on the 22 patients with measurable PanNET (median size 19 mm, range 
10–52 mm) after a median follow-up of 37.8 months confirmed the ORR of 
91% in PanNETs including CR in 7/22 (32%) consistent with significant 
activity in VHL-associated PanNET.263 Of note, the decision to use 
belzutifan in small resectable tumors needs to be individualized. Data for

MS-26 
the use of belzutifan for larger tumors, locally advanced unresectable 
tumors, and distant disease are extremely limited and clinical trials are 
ongoing (NCT04924075). 
Preoperative Management 
Surgical resection is the optimal treatment for locoregional pancreatic 
endocrine tumors. Before excision, however, any symptoms of hormonal 
excess must be treated. Octreotide LAR or lanreotide can be used for 
symptom control in most PanNET subtypes.137 Octreotide LAR or 
lanreotide can be considered for patients with insulinoma but only if the 
tumor expresses SSTRs, because they can suppress counterregulatory 
hormones such as growth hormone, glucagon, and catecholamines. In this 
situation, octreotide LAR and lanreotide can precipitously worsen 
hypoglycemia and can result in fatal complications.264 Octreotide LAR and 
lanreotide should not be used in patients with insulinoma who have a 
negative result by SSTR-based imaging. 
In addition, specific measures are often recommended based on 
symptoms. For insulinomas, it is important to stabilize glucose levels with 
diet and/or diazoxide and/or everolimus.265-267 For gastrinomas, gastrin 
hypersecretion may be treated with high-dose PPIs. For patients with 
glucagonoma, treatment of hyperglycemia and diabetes is necessary, 
especially to control blood sugar level prior to surgery. All patients who 
might require splenectomy should receive preoperative vaccination 
against pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae type b, and 
meningococcal group c. Care should be taken to ensure appropriate 
boosters are given within the recommended time frame. 
Surgical Management of Non-functioning Pancreatic Neuroendocrine 
Tumors (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
For tumors >1 cm to ≤2 cm, other recommended options include 
pancreatectomy, or enucleation in select cases. As appropriate, central 
pancreatectomy or spleen-preserving surgery should be considered. The 
Panel recommends surgical resection for larger tumors absent 
contraindications. Pancreatectomy is recommended for larger (>2 cm), 
invasive, node-positive, nonfunctional tumors. Pancreatectomies should 
have negative margins (including adjacent organs) and include a regional 
lymphadenectomy unless risk of nodal metastasis is low. Lymph node 
resection should be considered for tumors 1 to 2 cm, because there is a 
small but real risk of lymph node metastases.268,269 Central 
pancreatectomy or spleen-preserving surgery should be considered as 
appropriate in select cases. Surveillance imaging is recommended for 10 
years and MRI over CT should be considered to minimize radiation risks.  
Surgical Management of Gastrinomas 
The treatment approach for gastrinoma usually depends on the results of 
preoperative localization studies and on findings during exploratory 
laparotomy. In patients with occult gastrinoma (ie, no primary tumor or 
metastasis is seen on imaging), the Panel recommends either observation 
or exploratory surgery, including duodenotomy and intraoperative 
ultrasound with enucleation or local resection/enucleation of tumors if 
identified at operation, and removal of periduodenal nodes. A 
pancreatoduodenectomy without tumor localization is not recommended 
by the Panel. 
Gastrinomas in the duodenum are treated with duodenotomy and 
intraoperative ultrasound with local resection or enucleation of tumors and 
periduodenal node dissection. Gastrinomas in the head of the pancreas 
should be managed with pancreatoduodenectomy. Although rare, 
gastrinomas in the distal pancreas are treated with distal pancreatectomy 
and splenectomy and removal of the regional lymph nodes. Gastrinomas 
have high metastatic potential,270 which is the rationale for splenectomy.

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-27 
Surgical Management of Insulinomas 
The treatment for exophytic or peripheral insulinomas, because they are 
usually benign, is enucleation. Sporadic tumors are usually solitary, 
whereas familial tumors are multiple. If enucleation is not possible 
because of invasion or tumor location within the pancreas, then 
pancreatoduodenectomy for tumors in the head of the pancreas or distal 
pancreatectomy with preservation of the spleen for smaller tumors not 
involving splenic vessels may be performed. A minimally invasive 
resection can be considered.  
Surgical Management of Glucagonomas 
Most glucagonomas are malignant and calcified and located in the tail of 
the pancreas, with regional node involvement. The recommended 
treatment is distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy and resection of the 
peripancreatic lymph nodes. For tumors in the pancreatic head, 
pancreatoduodenectomy with resection of the peripancreatic lymph nodes 
is recommended. Small (<2 cm) peripheral glucagonomas are rare; 
enucleation or local excision with peripancreatic lymph dissection may be 
considered for small peripheral tumors of the head or distal pancreas. A 
hypercoagulable state has been reported in 10% to 33% of patients with 
glucagonoma.271,272 Therefore, perioperative anticoagulation can be 
considered because of the increased risk of pulmonary emboli. 
Surgical Management of VIPomas 
Distal VIPomas are treated with distal pancreatectomy with resection of 
peripancreatic lymph nodes and with or without splenectomy. 
Pancreatoduodenectomy with dissection of peripancreatic nodes is 
recommended for tumors in the head of the pancreas. Small (<2 cm) 
peripheral VIPomas are rare; enucleation or local excision with 
peripancreatic lymph dissection may be considered for small peripheral 
tumors of the head or distal pancreas. 
Surgical Management of Other Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Well-
Differentiated Grade 1/2)  
The treatment recommendations for tumors secreting hormones such as 
somatostatinoma, ACTH, parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), 
and PP are similar to those for nonfunctioning tumors.  
Surveillance of Resected Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Well-
Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
Disease recurrence has been observed in 21% to 42% of patients with 
PanNETs and can occur after many years.273-275 Higher lymph node ratio 
and Ki-67 status may indicate a higher chance of recurrence.273 Patients 
should undergo follow-up 12 weeks to 12 months after resection, or earlier 
if the patient presents with symptoms. After 1-year post-resection, follow-
up should occur every 6 to 12 months for up to 10 years post-resection 
with an H&P, follow-up with biochemical markers as clinically indicated for 
functional tumors, and imaging. After 10 years, surveillance should be 
considered as clinically indicated.276 Multiphasic abdomen CT or MRI 
should be performed. Chest CT scans (with or without contrast) can be 
performed as clinically indicated. These surveillance recommendations 
may also apply to cases where observation of patients has been chosen. 
Less frequent surveillance may be appropriate for low-risk tumors such as 
well-differentiated stage I PanNETs. SSTR-based imaging or 
FDG-PET/CT scans are not recommended for routine surveillance. 
The optimal duration of surveillance is unknown. In one study of 123 
patients with resected sporadic PanNETs, most recurrences occurred 
within 5 years of resection, and all recurrences occurred within 10 
years.277 In select cases, including resectable locoregional or 
oligometastatic recurrence, surgical resection may be considered.

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-28 
Management of Locoregional Advanced and/or Metastatic Neuroendocrine 
Tumors of the Pancreas (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
To evaluate the extent of locoregional advanced disease and/or distant 
metastases, multiphasic abdomen, with or without pelvis, CT or MRI scans 
with IV contrast should be performed. SSTR-based imaging is also 
recommended. A chest CT scan with or without contrast and appropriate 
biochemical evaluation may be carried out as clinically indicated. 
Metastases in patients with NETs of the pancreas, when they develop, 
often occur first in the liver. In patients with limited hepatic disease for 
whom cytoreduction is possible, surgical excision of both the primary 
tumor and liver metastases with curative intent is recommended when 
possible and can be performed in a staged or synchronous fashion. See 
Principles of Surgical Management of Neuroendocrine Tumors in the 
algorithm. A meta-analysis reported that 5-year OS ranges from 41% to 
100% in this patient population.278 When performing staged 
pancreatoduodenectomy and liver resection, hepatectomy should be 
considered before pancreatic resection to reduce the risk of perihepatic 
sepsis from the contaminated biliary tree.279 Alternatively, consideration of 
belzutifan for resectable tumors in the setting of germline VHL alteration is 
an option (category 2B). The decision to use belzutifan in small tumors 
needs to be individualized. Although resection may provide clinical benefit, 
most patients with metastatic disease will experience recurrence.280,281 
Additional resection or ablation may be possible. A study of 172 patients 
who had liver resection of metastatic NETs (55 with the primary tumor in 
the pancreas) showed that significant long-term survival can be achieved 
after recurrence in many patients, with a 10-year OS rate of 50.4%.282 If 
resection is performed for advanced NETs and future treatment with 
octreotide or lanreotide is anticipated, cholecystectomy is recommended 
given the association between long-term treatment with SSAs and the 
development of biliary symptoms and gallstones.137 
Unfortunately, most patients who present with advanced PanNETs have 
unresectable disease. For selected patients who are asymptomatic and 
have low tumor burden and stable disease, observation can be 
considered, with marker assessment and multiphasic abdomen and pelvis 
CT or MRI scans every 12 weeks to 12 months until clinically significant 
disease progression occurs. Chest CT scans with or without contrast may 
also be performed as clinically indicated. In addition, treatment with 
octreotide LAR or lanreotide can be considered. The optimal time to begin 
therapy in this patient population is not known. 
For those who initially present with symptomatic disease, clinically 
significant tumor burden, or clinically significant disease progression, 
clinically significant symptoms should be managed as appropriate. 
Octreotide LAR or lanreotide are the most commonly used first-line 
options. Alternative front-line therapy may be considered in select cases 
(eg, systemic therapy or locoregional therapy prior to or concurrently with 
octreotide LAR or lanreotide).  
For patients with disease progression, preferred systemic therapy options 
are cabozantinib (category 1 if prior treatment with everolimus, lutetium Lu 
177 dotatate or sunitinib), everolimus (category 1 for progressive disease), 
sunitinib (category 1 for progressive disease), octreotide LAR or lanreotide 
(if tumor is SSTR-positive), PRRT with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (if tumor is 
SSTR-positive by imaging and progressive on octreotide LAR or 
lanreotide), and temozolomide plus capecitabine (preferred when tumor 
response is needed for symptoms or cytoreduction). Other recommended 
regimens include FOLFOX or CAPEOX for patients with bulky,

patients with progressive PanNETs; and consideration of RT with or 
without concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for locally 
advanced unresectable disease (excluding small bowel mesenteric). Of 
note, data for the use of belzutifan for larger tumors, locally advanced 
tumors, and distant disease are extremely limited. Clinical trials are 
ongoing (NCT04924075). Locoregional therapy is also an option (ie, 
liver-directed therapy for liver-predominant disease; consideration of RT; 
with or without concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for locally 
advanced unresectable disease [excluding small bowel mesenteric]; and 
palliative RT for oligometastatic disease and/or symptomatic masses 
[excluding mesenteric masses]).  
Symptom Control 
Somatostatin Analogs 
Patients with PanNETs and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion should, 
in most cases, receive treatment with either octreotide LAR or lanreotide 
and/or other medication to manage their symptoms as previously 
described. The one exception is patients with insulin-producing tumors 
that are SSTR-negative by imaging (in whom SSA treatment can 
paradoxically worsen symptoms).283 For symptom and/or tumor control, 
octreotide LAR 20–30 mg intramuscularly or lanreotide 120 mg 
subcutaneously every 4 weeks is recommended. Higher doses have been 
shown to be safe. Subcutaneous octreotide 100–250 mcg three times 
daily can be considered for breakthrough symptoms. If injection site-
related complications occur, consider switching to another SSA. After 
clinical, symptomatic, or radiographic progression on standard SSA doses, 
for symptom and/or tumor control, above-label dosing octreotide LAR (up 
to 60 mg once a month) or lanreotide (up to 120 mg every 14 days) may 
be useful in select cases. Additional strategies may also be considered for 
control of hormone-mediated symptoms as described in the previous 
sections, including debulking surgery, locoregional therapy, and agents 
like PPIs for gastrinomas, and diazoxide, everolimus, and/or cornstarch 
supplementation for insulinoma.283,284 For example, the hyperglycemia 
associated with everolimus can be leveraged to stabilize glucose levels in 
patients with insulinomas.285 
Tumor Control 
Somatostatin Analogs 
Results from the CLARINET study, in which 204 patients with GEP-NETs 
(including both carcinoid and PanNETs) were randomized to receive 
treatment with either lanreotide or placebo, showed that treatment with 
lanreotide was associated with in an improvement in PFS (PFS, not 
reached vs. 18 months; HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.30–0.73; P < .001).163 
Although no randomized studies to date have directly shown an antitumor 
effect of octreotide in PanNETs, the PROMID trial showed an 
improvement in time to tumor progression (14.3 vs. 6 months; P = 
.000072) compared to placebo in patients with midgut NETs.161  
Above-Label Dosing 
The phase II CLARINET FORTE study included patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic grade 1/2 midgut NETs or PanNETs with 
progression on standard-dose lanreotide (120 mg every 28 days), and 
demonstrated that a reduction in the dosing interval was feasible.140 The 
median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 5.5–8.3) in patients with PanNETs 
treated with lanreotide at a dose of 120 mg every 14 days for up to 48 
weeks. The randomized NETTER-1 (midgut tumors) and NETTER-2 
(GEP-NET with Ki-67 index 10%–55%) both compared lutetium Lu 177 
dotatate/standard-dose octreotide LAR to above-label octreotide LAR 60 
mg/month.139,166 While PRRT appeared to be superior to high-dose 
octreotide in both studies, the median PFS in the control arms was 8.4 
months in NETTER-1 and 8.5 months in NETTER-2; treatment appeared 
to be safe with possible cytostatic effect.

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-30 
SSTR-Negative Disease 
A retrospective study by Refardt et al investigated the outcomes of 
patients with SSTR-negative and SSTR-positive metastatic grade 1 or 2 
NETs.286 In a subgroup analysis of patients treated with SSAs, patients 
with SSTR-negative NETs were matched to those with SSTR-positive 
NETs by propensity score. The median OS of patients with SSTR-negative 
NETs was 39 months, compared to 72 months (P = .14) in those with 
SSTR-positive NETs. PFS was significantly inferior in the former group (15 
months vs. 47 months, P = .006).  
Choice of SSA Therapy 
Octreotide LAR and lanreotide share the same mechanism of action, and 
the Panel believes that either octreotide LAR or lanreotide are appropriate 
options for tumor control. Additional therapies can be given in place of or 
in addition to octreotide LAR or lanreotide, as discussed below. 
Molecularly Targeted Therapies 
The molecularly targeted agents everolimus, sunitinib, and cabozantinib 
have been confirmed to have antitumor activity and to improve PFS in 
patients with advanced PanNETs. In addition, as previously noted, 
belzutifan has activity in localized PanNETs not requiring immediate 
surgery, in the setting of germline VHL.   
Everolimus, administered orally at a dose of 10 mg once daily, was 
evaluated in the randomized phase III RADIANT-3 study, to which 410 
patients with advanced, progressive PanNETs were enrolled.287 In this 
study, the median PFS duration for patients randomized to everolimus was 
11.0 months compared with 4.6 months for patients receiving placebo (P < 
.001; HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.27–0.45). The median OS was 44.0 months 
(95% CI, 35.6–51.8 months) for those treated with everolimus compared 
to 37.7 months (95% CI, 29.1–45.8 months) to those receiving placebo 
(HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.73–1.20; P = .30).288 A subset analysis of 
RADIANT-3 suggested that the PFS benefit associated with everolimus is 
independent of prior or concurrent SSA therapy or prior chemotherapy.289 
Adverse events associated with everolimus include stomatitis, 
hyperglycemia, rash, diarrhea, and, in rare cases, pneumonitis.287,288 Other 
side effects have also been described.170-172 One report highlighted the 
outcomes of 169 pretreated patients with advanced NETs of the pancreas 
(n = 85) or other sites (n = 84) who received everolimus through a 
compassionate use program.174 A higher risk of adverse events was noted 
in patients with previous radiolabeled peptide therapy and chemotherapy. 
Sunitinib, an oral VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) also has 
activity in PanNETs. In a multicenter randomized study, sunitinib 37.5 mg 
once daily was compared with placebo in 171 patients with advanced, 
progressive, metastatic PanNETs.290 Those assigned to sunitinib had a 
median PFS duration of 12.6 months (95% CI, 11.1–20.6 months), 
compared to 5.8 months in patients receiving placebo (95% CI, 3.8–7.2 
months; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18–0.55; P = .000015), by blinded 
independent central review. In the intention-to-treat population, there was 
no significant difference in OS; median OS was 38.6 months (95% CI, 
25.6–56.4 months) for those treated with sunitinib and 29.1 months (95% 
CI, 16.4–36.8 months) for those treated with placebo (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 
0.50–1.06; P = .094), recognizing that 69% of patients on the placebo arm 
subsequently received sunitinib. Long-term treatment (median 87.1 
weeks) did not alter the safety profile.291 Adverse events associated with 
sunitinib included fatigue and, in rare cases, congestive heart failure.292 
Other side effects have also been described, including diarrhea, mucositis, 
and weakness.293 
More recently, cabozantinib, given at a dose of 60 mg daily, was 
investigated in the phase III CABINET trial in patients with moderately 
differentiated or well-differentiated locally advanced or metastatic 
pancreatic or extrapancreatic NETs. Patients were randomized 2:1 to

MS-31 
receive cabozantinib or placebo.177 Patients with PanNETs had to have 
had prior treatment with everolimus, sunitinib, or lutetium Lu 177 dotatate 
PRRT. In the pancreatic cohort, the median PFS was 13.8 months in the 
cabozantinib arm and 4.4 months in the placebo arm (stratified HR for 
progression or death, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.12–0.42; P < .001). Patients who 
received cabozantinib had an ORR of 19% (vs. 0% with placebo) and a 
median OS of 40.0 months (vs. 31.1 months with placebo; HR, 0.95). 
Overall, 65% of patients in the cabozantinib arm had a grade 3/4 adverse 
event possibly related to treatment, compared to 23% of patients in the 
placebo arm. While everolimus and sunitinib received FDA approval for 
PanNETs in 2011, cabozantinib is not currently approved for this 
indication. 
While belzutifan was approved in 2021 for the treatment of VHL disease-
associated tumors including PanNETs, the original study focused on 
patients with renal cell carcinoma (with other germline VHL disease-
associated neoplasms) and did not include patients with advanced 
disease.262 See the section on nonoperative management for additional 
information on belzutifan. Treatment with belzutifan yielded an impressive 
ORR of 91% in 22 patients with concurrent PanNETs.263 However, limited 
data exist to support the use of belzutifan in patients with metastatic or 
locally advanced PanNET.294 Furthermore, the role of belzutifan in the 
setting of somatic (but not germline) VHL alterations is similarly unclear. 
Clinical trials are ongoing (eg, NCT04924075). 
Cytotoxic Chemotherapy for Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine 
Tumors (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy is another option for patients with locoregional 
advanced or metastatic PanNETs. Oral temozolomide-based therapy is 
the most commonly used chemotherapy regimen for PanNET, typically in 
combination with capecitabine. Temozolomide has been administered 
using different schedules, either alone or in combination with other 
agents.181,295-298 In a randomized phase II study (ECOG-ACRIN E2211), 
patients with advanced low-grade or intermediate-grade PanNETs treated 
with temozolomide and capcitabine had a median PFS of 22.7 months, 
compared to 14.4 months for those treated with temozolomide alone (HR, 
0.58; P = .022).299 However, the median OS was not significantly different 
(temozolomide with capecitabine, 58.7 months; temozolomide, 53.8 
months; HR, 0.82; P = .42). A meta-analysis of 384 patients with 
advanced NENs reported an OS >12 months and a 73% disease control 
rate.300  
Other temozolomide-based combination regimens have been explored. 
One small study assessed the safety and efficacy of temozolomide 
administered with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against 
VEGF.295 Five of the 15 patients (33%) with PanNETs had a radiographic 
response (with no responses in the 19 patients with carcinoid tumors), and 
the toxicity was acceptable. In another single-arm study, the combination 
of temozolomide (150 mg/m2 on days 1–7 and 15–21 of every 28-day 
cycle) plus everolimus (10 mg/day) was found to be safe, with PRs 
observed in 40% of patients with PanNETs.301 It should be noted, 
however, that use of temozolomide was limited to 6 months due to 
concerns about the risk of selective lymphopenia with the biweekly 
schedule, and all patients received prophylaxis against pneumocystis 
jirovecii (carinii) pneumonia (PJP). Currently, the most commonly used 
regimen remains the 5-day temozolomide regimen alone or in combination 
with capecitabine, with most capping therapy at 13 cycles.299 
Other cytotoxic agents also have activity in PanNETs. One study with 89 
patients with PanNETs found a PR rate of 30%, a median PFS of 9 
months, and a median OS of 30 months,180 while a smaller study obtained 
a disease control rate of 78% with the use of FOLFOX.302 Another study 
with 48 patients with metastatic enteropancreatic NETs, 33 of which had 
PanNETs, reported a disease control rate of 83.3%, a median PFS of 12.6

months, and a median OS of 29.4 months.303 An ORR of 45.2% was 
demonstrated in patients with aggressive PanNETs who received multiple 
prior therapies and were treated with FOLFOX (n = 25) or FOLFOX and 
bevacizumab (n = 6).304 The disease control rate was 93.5%, with a 
median PFS of 6 months (95% CI, 5.0 months–7.0 months), and a median 
OS of 16 months (95% CI, 11.3 months–20.7 months) and 67 months 
(95% CI, 49.8 months–84.2 months) from the start of the study and from 
the time of diagnosis, respectively. The combination of capecitabine and 
oxaliplatin was assessed in a phase II study, with response rates of 23% 
in patients with poorly differentiated NETs and 30% in well-differentiated 
disease.305 As oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy has shown some promising 
results,306 more studies are needed to expand these findings. 
Radiolabeled Somatostatin Analogs for Advanced Pancreatic 
Neuroendocrine Tumors (Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
Treatment with radiolabeled SSAs has been reported to result in tumor 
responses in patients with advanced PanNETs.184-188 Numerous large, 
non-randomized cohort analyses have also reported encouraging survival 
rates with this approach.191,192,230 In general, these studies have enrolled 
only patients with evidence of high tumoral SSTR expression. One 
retrospective study of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate in a group of 610 Dutch 
patients with metastatic GEP-NETs and bronchial NETs included 133 
patients with PanNETs.230 Patients with a primary NET in the pancreas 
had the longest OS (71 months) and the ORR was 54% with six patients 
experiencing a CR. These data, coupled with the results of the 
randomized NETTER-1 study of high-dose octreotide versus lutetium Lu 
177 dotatate plus octreotide LAR in advanced midgut NETs (NETTER-1), 
led to the approval of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate for SSTR+ GEP-NETs in 
2018.166 Since then, there have been additional reports that treatment with 
lutetium Lu 177 dotatate can also lead to symptomatic and biochemical 
responses in patients with functional metastatic PanNETs.307  
More recently, data from two prospective studies have confirmed the 
activity of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate -based SSTR PRRT in PanNETs. The 
OCLURANDOM study was a prospective randomized noncomparative 
phase II study in which patients with SSTR+ PanNETs were randomized 
to receive lutetium Lu 177 or sunitinib.308 Overall, 84 patients were 
enrolled, 37% with Ki-67 index >10%. The primary endpoint was 12-month 
PFS by central review. The lutetium Lu 177 dotatate arm was associated 
with a 12-month PFS rate of 80.5% (90% CI, 67.5%–89.9%) and median 
PFS of 20.7 months (90% CI, 17.2–23.7 months); the sunitinib arm was 
associated with a 12-month PFS rate of 42% (90% CI, 29.1%–55.5%) and 
median PFS of 11 months (90% CI, 8.8–12.4 months). Grade 3/4 adverse 
events occurred in both groups (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, sunitinib), with 
fatigue (7% vs. 12%, respectively), decreased blood counts (12% vs. 
24%), and hypertension (12% vs. 19%) being the most common toxicities.  
The NETTER-2 study also enrolled patients with PanNETs in a 
prospective randomized trial for patients with advanced high-risk SSTR+ 
GEP-NET (Ki-67 index 10%–55%).139 A total of 226 patients were 
randomized 2:1 to lutetium Lu 177 dotatate plus octreotide LAR or 
octreotide LAR 60 mg/month in the first-line setting. The median Ki-67 
index was 16% (range 12%–25%), 65% had G2 disease, and 54% had a 
PanNET. The primary endpoint was PFS by central review, which was 
22.8 months (95% CI, 19.4–not estimated) in the lutetium Lu 177 dotatate 
group and 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.7–13.8) in the control arm (P < .0001). 
Consistent benefit was observed across all subgroups, including G2 
versus G3, pancreas versus. non-pancreas versus small intestine primary, 
providing additional support for PRRT in PanNETs. OS data were not 
mature at the time of the analysis. Time to deterioration in QOL was 
similar in both groups. One case of myelodysplasia was noted in the 
lutetium Lu 177 dotatate plus octreotide LAR group, although further 
follow-up is needed to full assess long-term safety.

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-33 
The Panel recommends PRRT with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate as a 
treatment option for patients with locoregional advanced PanNETs and/or 
distant metastases who have symptomatic disease, clinically significant 
tumor burden, or clinically significant progressive disease, and disease 
progression on octreotide LAR or lanreotide and with positive SSTR 
imaging. In the absence of a clear survival benefit and long-term safety 
data, the use of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate plus octreotide LAR or lanreotide 
in the first-line setting should be individualized, recognizing that a number 
of other treatment options have not been directly compared to PRRT (eg, 
chemotherapy, liver-directed therapy). 
Locoregional Therapies for Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors 
(Well-Differentiated Grade 1/2) 
Liver-directed therapies (see Principles of Liver-Directed Therapy for 
Neuroendocrine Tumor Metastases in the algorithm) may be considered in 
patients with progressive liver-predominant metastatic disease, to reduce 
tumor bulk and relieve symptoms of hormone hypersecretion.197 The Panel 
lists cytoreductive surgery or ablative therapy (ie, RFA,203 cryotherapy, 
microwave200,202) as recommendations for these patients. See the 
Principles of Surgical Management of Neuroendocrine Tumors. Although 
some groups report that the risks of cytoreductive surgery outweigh its 
benefits,309 others have reported good outcomes.310,311 
Additional options include RT (SBRT312 and stereotactic ablative 
radiotherapy [SABR]) and hepatic arterial therapies including bland 
hepatic TAE,204 TACE,313 and TARE.208-211,314 Whereas embolization in 
general is considered an effective approach in patients with 
liver-predominant disease,195,196,198 only limited data compare the various 
embolization techniques, and the optimal embolization approach remains 
uncertain. After any prior biliary instrumentation, there are increased risks 
of infectious complications associated with liver-directed therapies.315  
RT, with or without concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, may 
be considered for locally advanced unresectable disease (excluding small 
bowel mesenteric).316-318 Palliative RT is recommended for oligometastatic 
disease and/or symptomatic metastases (excluding mesenteric masses).  
Liver Transplantation Considered Investigational 
Several series have now reported the results of liver transplantation in 
patients with PanNETs whose metastases are confined to the liver.216-
219,319 A meta-analysis showed that, while 5-year survival rates are 
encouraging, the majority of patients undergoing liver transplantation 
ultimately develop recurrence.221 The Panel acknowledged the 
considerable associated risks and deemed liver transplantation to be 
investigational and not part of routine care at this time.  
Neuroendocrine Tumors Neoplasms of Unknown Primary  
The incidence rate for NETs of an unknown primary site is 0.84 per 
100,000 persons according to a SEER database analysis.1,2 Identification 
of the primary site can help guide treatment decisions, although there is 
growing overlap in the treatment of NETs arising in different organ 
sites.320,321 If the primary tumor cannot be identified, treatment decisions 
are generally guided by tumor histology (see Histologic Classification and 
Staging of Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors, above). Metastatic 
well-differentiated NETs are often treated like midgut tumors, since it is 
well documented that occult primary tumors can be often be found in the 
small bowel.322,323  
Evaluation of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of Unknown Primary 
The initial evaluation of a patient with biopsy-proven NENs of unknown 
primary includes family history, clinical manifestations, laboratory studies, 
imaging studies, and/or immunohistochemical studies.

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-34 
Given some differences in systemic treatment approaches for 
extrapancreatic NETs and PanNETs, establishing whether a patient has a 
primary PanNET can have important treatment implications (eg, greater 
role for chemotherapy). Tumor-localizing studies include imaging studies, 
such as chest CT scans with or without contrast, and multiphasic 
abdomen and pelvis CT or MRI scans. SSTR-based imaging may be very 
helpful in localizing primary NETs.89,324 An FDG-PET/CT or PET/MRI scan 
and with or without brain imaging with contrast (CT or MRI) can 
occasionally be useful in finding a primary tumor, but are less sensitive in 
well-differentiated NETs and should only be considered in cases of poorly 
differentiated tumors. 
EGD or EUS and/or colonoscopy can be considered in selected cases. 
Most of the time, primary tumors are obvious on DOTA PET scans. See 
Principles of Imaging in the algorithm. It is common for small bowel NETs 
to be small and difficult to visualize, although in some cases imaging may 
demonstrate an associated, sometimes calcified, mesenteric mass. 
Exploratory surgery is not routine for purely diagnostic purposes. 
However, if a small bowel primary tumor is suggested by symptoms and 
radiologic findings and if metastases can be optimally debulked, surgery 
can be considered (being careful to run the small bowel to assess for 
occult, and sometimes multiple primary tumors).323 Biochemical testing 
should be done as appropriate.  
Treatment of Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of Unknown Primary 
In the absence of a primary tumor identified in the pancreas, well-
differentiated grade 1/2 tumors should be treated similarly to locoregional 
advanced disease and/or distant metastases of the GI tract, as described 
above. This is especially true for patients with liver-dominant metastases 
and/or prominent mesenteric lymphadenopathy. If the primary tumor is 
found, treatment should be according to the specific tumor type. If the 
primary tumor is not identified, poorly differentiated NENs should be 
treated as described for Extrapulmonary Poorly Differentiated: 
Neuroendocrine Carcinomas/Large or Small Cell Carcinomas/Mixed 
Neuroendocrine-Non-Neuroendocrine Neoplasm, below. 
Well-differentiated grade 3 tumors should be managed and treated as 
described below in the Well-Differentiated Grade 3 Neuroendocrine 
Tumors section. 
Well-Differentiated Grade 3 Neuroendocrine Tumors 
Well-differentiated G3 NETs were introduced as a new category in the 
2017 WHO classification update of pancreatic NENs, and in the 2019 
WHO classification for digestive system (GEP) NENs (including unknown 
primary tumors).17,325 These encompass tumors that have a high 
proliferation rate, with a mitotic index >20 mitoses per 2 mm2 or a Ki-67 
index >20%, and a well-differentiated morphology.326 These occur mostly 
in the pancreas, stomach, and colon, although they can occur at any 
primary site. Well-differentiated G3 tumors have an intermediate prognosis 
compared to PDNECs and G1–G2 well-differentiated NETs.2,28,327 
Well-differentiated G3 tumors have and intermediate prognosis compared 
to PDNECs and G1–G2. The results from two studies showed that 
patients with well-differentiated G3 NETs had a significantly higher median 
OS (41–99 months vs. 17 months) compared to patients with 
PDNECs.328,329 
Evaluation of Well-Differentiated Grade 3 Neuroendocrine Tumors 
Imaging with multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI scans with contrast, 
chest CT scans (as clinically indicated), and SSTR-based PET imaging 
(SSTR-PET) is recommended. SSTR-based PET imaging should include 
PET/CT or PET/MRI of the skull vertex to mid-thigh with multiphase IV 
contrast (both arterial and portal venous phase), when possible. FDG-

potential impact of FDG avidity on prognosis.330-332 Biochemical evaluation 
should be performed as clinically indicated if the patient has symptoms 
suggestive of a secretory tumor. Pathology review is also recommended, 
recognizing the potential difficulty distinguishing G3 NET from large cell 
NEC (see Principles of Pathology in the algorithm).4,333 A subgroup of G3 
NETs arises in the setting of apparent grade progression over time; as 
such, a prior history of G1 or G2 NET strongly favors G3 NET (over NEC) 
if G3 disease is confirmed. Assessment of p53, Rb, and p16, by 
histopathologic analysis or molecular profiling, can be considered if there 
is uncertainty about the tumor’s degree of differentiation, as a mutation in 
these genes would suggest a PDNEC.4,334-336 SSTR 2A staining may also 
be helpful.337 Tumor/somatic molecular profiling should be considered for 
patients with locoregional unresectable or metastatic disease who are 
candidates for anti-cancer therapy to identify actionable alterations. 
Testing on tumor tissue is preferred; however, cell-free DNA testing can 
be considered if tumor tissue testing is not feasible. As appropriate, 
genetic counseling and testing for inherited genetic syndromes is 
recommended for duodenal NETs or PanNETs.  
Treatment of Well-Differentiated Grade 3 Neuroendocrine Tumors  
Treatment recommendations are based on the biology of the tumor. A 
tumor with favorable biology typically possesses Ki-67 <55%, is 
slower-growing, and has a positive SSTR-based PET result. A tumor with 
unfavorable biology typically has Ki-67% ≥55%, is faster-growing, and may 
yield a negative SSTR-based PET result (and shows positive uptake on 
FDG-PET). Importantly, the data informing the appropriate Ki-67 cutoff are 
limited and variability/heterogeneity of Ki-67 in a given tumor and over 
time in serial biopsies make decision-making less straightforward in this 
entity compared to other NENs. The clinical course can be heterogeneous 
and treatment considerations need to account for both pathologic and 
clinical features.  
For locoregional (resectable) disease, resection is recommended, along 
with regional lymphadenectomy, if feasible, regardless of tumor biology 
but is particularly recommended if there is favorable tumor biology (slow 
growing, positive SSTR-based PET imaging, Ki-67 index <55%).338 Patient 
factors should also be considered. For resectable locoregional disease 
with unfavorable biology, a clinical trial is preferred. Neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy can be given on a case-by-case basis for these patients 
and options include cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/etoposide, 
oxaliplatin-based therapy (FOLFOX or CAPEOX), or temozolomide with or 
without capecitabine. Temozolomide, with or without capecitabine, may 
have more activity in tumors arising in the pancreas compared to GI NETs. 
Following the completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the patient should 
undergo resection with regional lymphadenectomy if feasible.  
For resectable locally advanced or metastatic disease with favorable 
biology, resection of the primary and metastatic sites may be performed, if 
feasible, with acceptable risk and toxicity profile. The treatment for 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic tumors with favorable biology 
depends on the degree of tumor burden and the primary site (if primary 
tumor in place). If the patient is asymptomatic with low tumor burden, 
observation with a short interval follow-up scan is an option for select 
patients; otherwise, octreotide LAR or lanreotide is recommended if the 
patient has SSTR-positive tumors and/or has hormonal symptoms. 
Palliative RT is an option for oligometastatic disease and/or symptomatic 
metastases (excluding mesenteric masses).339  
There are multiple treatment modalities if the patient has favorable biology 
but clinically significant tumor burden or evidence of disease progression. 
Enrollment in a clinical trial is preferred. Other recommended treatment 
options include systemic therapy or locoregional therapy. Systemic 
therapy options include cabozantinib177; chemotherapy (temozolomide, 
with or without capecitabine,340,341 FOLFOX, CAPEOX, cisplatin/etoposide,

or carboplatin/etoposide); everolimus; octreotide LAR or lanreotide (if the 
patient has SSTR-positive disease and/or has hormonal symptoms); 
consideration of pembrolizumab for patients with microsatellite 
instability-high (MSI-H), mismatch repair deficient (dMMR), or advanced 
tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) tumors (≥10 mut/Mb and as 
determined by an FDA-approved test) that have progressed following prior 
treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options342,343; 
PRRT with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (if the tumor is SSTR-positive); 
sunitinib (pancreas only); and consideration of RT, with or without 
concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for locally advanced 
unresectable disease. For symptom and/or tumor control, octreotide LAR 
20–30 mg intramuscularly or lanreotide 120 mg subcutaneously every 4 
weeks is recommended. Higher doses have been shown to be safe. 
Subcutaneous octreotide 100–250 mcg three times daily can be 
considered for breakthrough symptoms. If injection site-related 
complications occur, consider switching to another SSA. 
In the phase III CABINET trial, patients with pancreatic or extrapancreatic 
NETs were randomized 2:1 to receive cabozantinib or placebo.177 
Although the numbers were small (N = 13 extrapancreatic G3 NET, N = 11 
pancreatic G3 NET), a subgroup analysis showed that treatment with 
cabozantinib improved the HR for disease progression or death in patients 
with grade 3 NETs in both the pancreatic (HR, 0.02) and extrapancreatic 
(HR, 0.79) cohorts. As such, cabozantinib is an option for patients with 
locally advanced/metastatic G3 NET (unresectable with clinically 
significant tumor burden or evidence of disease progression) with 
favorable biology.  
Emerging data suggest SSTR-based PRRT also has activity in G3 NETs. 
One small study reported outcomes in patients with heavily pretreated, 
progressive, well-differentiated G3 NETs treated with lutetium Lu 177 
dotatate.344 Out of 18 evaluable patients, 28% had a PR, 44% had stable 
disease, and 28% experienced disease progression. The disease control 
rate was 72% and the median PFS was 13.1 months. More recently, 
PRRT was evaluated in the first-line setting (NETTER-2 study) in patients 
with advanced high-risk SSTR+ GEP-NET (Ki-67 index 10%–55%). 139 A 
total of 226 patients were randomized 2:1 to lutetium Lu 177 dotatate plus 
octreotide LAR or octreotide LAR 60 mg/month in the first-line setting. The 
median Ki-67 index was 16% (range 12%–25%), 65% had G2 disease, 
and 54% had a PanNET. The primary endpoint was PFS by central 
review, which was 22.8 months (95% CI, 19.4–not estimated) in the 
lutetium Lu 177 dotatate-treated group and 8.5 months (95% CI, 7.7–13.8) 
in the control arm (P < .0001). Consistent benefit was observed across all 
subgroups, including G2 versus G3 NET, and pancreas versus 
non-pancreas versus small intestine primary. OS data were not mature at 
the time of the analysis. Time to deterioration in QOL was similar in both 
groups. One case of myelodysplasia was noted in the lutetium Lu 177 
dotatate plus octreotide LAR group, although further follow-up is needed to 
full assess long-term safety.  
After clinical, symptomatic, or radiographic progression on standard SSA 
doses, for symptom and/or tumor control, above-label dosing of octreotide 
LAR (up to 60 mg once a month) or lanreotide (up to 120 mg every 14 
days) may be useful in selected cases (category 2B). However, it should 
be noted that most studies assessing high-dose SSAs have focused on 
patients with low-risk tumors.138,140,166 In contrast, the NETTER-2 study 
enrolled patients with G2 and G3 GEP-NET (Ki-67 index 20%–55%), 
although the median Ki-67 index was only 17%.139 Furthermore, octreotide 
LAR 60 mg/month was inferior to Lu 177 dotatate PRRT (as measured by 
PFS) in that study.  
Temozolomide, with or without capecitabine, may have more activity in 
tumors arising in the pancreas compared to GI NETs. Evolving data 
suggest that well-differentiated tumors with intermediate Ki-67 levels (in

the 20%–55% range) may not respond as well to platinum/etoposide as 
patients with higher Ki-67 (>55%).34 A few studies reported that treatment 
with platinum-based chemotherapy yielded almost no response (0%–2% 
response rate).328,329,345  
In a retrospective study of patients with grade 3 NETs evaluating the 
efficacy of various first-line therapies, FOLFOX was found to have the 
highest ORR (56.4%).346 Treatment with platinum (carboplatin or 
cisplatin)/etoposide or capecitabine/temozolomide resulted in ORRs of 
35.1% and 27.3%, respectively. However, capecitabine/temozolomide had 
the longest median PFS (12.0 months). The median PFS was 6.9 months 
for platinum/etoposide and FOLFOX. Another retrospective study 
investigated the efficacy of capecitabine/temozolomide in patients with 
unresectable/metastatic grade 3 GEP NENs.341 Ninety-two percent of 
patients were treated with capecitabine/temozolomide and 8% of patients 
were treated with temozolomide monotherapy. Among patients with well-
differentiated grade 3 NETs, the time to treatment failure was 5.7 months. 
The OS was 31.7 months and the response rate was 41%. 
Locoregional therapy options are liver-directed therapy for favorable 
biology liver-dominant disease; palliative RT for oligometastatic disease 
and/or symptomatic metastases339; and consideration of RT, with or 
without concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for locally 
advanced unresectable disease.347 
In the event of locally advanced or metastatic disease with unfavorable 
biology, a clinical trial is a preferred option. Cytostatic agents like oral 
small molecules (everolimus, sunitinib, SSAs) are predicted to be less 
effective in the setting of G3 NETs with unfavorable biology, although 
formal studies are lacking in this specific population. Chemotherapy is 
often employed. In addition to regimens used for G3 NET with favorable 
biology, other options in this setting include irinotecan-based therapies 
(eg, FOLFIRI, cisplatin/irinotecan, FOLFIRINOX), extrapolating from 
NEC,348-352 although the data for G3 NET specifically are limited. Other 
options include the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab (category 
2B) (ORR approximately 15%–25%), recognizing that some of the studies 
assessing this combination did not distinguish between G3 NET and 
NEC.353-356 Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is not approved for 
concurrent use with IV ipilimumab; however, for nivolumab monotherapy, 
nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy subcutaneous injection may be 
substituted for IV nivolumab. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy has 
different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV nivolumab. 
Single-agent pembrolizumab can be considered for patients with MSI-H, 
dMMR, or advanced TMB-H tumors (≥10 mut/Mb and as determined by an 
FDA-approved test) that have progressed following prior treatment and 
have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.342,343  
For patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease with unfavorable 
biology, locoregional therapy options include consideration of RT, with or 
without concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, for locally 
advanced unresectable disease; consideration of liver-directed therapies, 
including embolization, selective internal RT, ablation, and SBRT312 for 
selected cases of liver-predominant disease after systemic therapy; and 
palliative RT for oligometastatic disease and/or symptomatic metastases 
(excluding mesenteric masses).  
Surveillance of Well-Differentiated Grade 3 Neuroendocrine Tumors 
Surveillance for resectable locoregional or locally advanced disease 
consists of a routine patient H&P examination along with appropriate 
imaging studies (multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI scans with 
contrast and chest CT scans [as clinically indicated]) every 12 to 24 weeks 
for the first 2 years and every 6 to 12 months thereafter, for up to 10 years. 
Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease with 
favorable biology should be monitored every 12 to 24 weeks (depending 
on tumor biology), with an H&P and multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or

MRI with contrast. A chest CT, with or without contrast, as well as 
SSTR-PET/CT or SSTR-PET/MRI or FDG-PET/CT scans, and 
biochemical markers, are also recommended as clinically indicated. 
Patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease with 
unfavorable biology should be followed similarly (except for SSTR 
imaging), and the interval for initial scans should be every 8 to 12 weeks 
(depending on tumor biology). 
Extrapulmonary Poorly Differentiated: Neuroendocrine 
Carcinoma/Large or Small Cell Carcinoma/Mixed Neuroendocrine-
Non-Neuroendocrine Neoplasm  
Although rare, extrapulmonary PDNECs can occur in a wide variety of 
organs. They are characterized by a high mitotic index and high Ki-67 
index. The most aggressive of these tumors histologically resemble classic 
small cell carcinoma of the lung. The most frequent organs involved are 
the cervix, esophagus, pharynx and larynx, colon, rectum, prostate, 
pancreas, and bladder.357 Most extrapulmonary PDNECs are aggressive 
and require combined multimodality treatment, usually following a 
treatment paradigm that parallels the treatment of small cell lung cancer. 
These tumors are rarely associated with a hormonal syndrome. 
Gastrointestinal tumors with mixed histology of poorly differentiated 
adenocarcinoma can be treated according to the NCCN Guidelines for 
Colon Cancer and Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (available at 
www.NCCN.org) depending on their clinical course. 
Results from a SEER database analysis of NECs found that 9% were 
extrapulmonary.357 The median survival for all NECs was 7.7 months. 
Compared to other primary NECs (26.0%), the survival was lower for lung 
NECs (5.6%) and GI NECs (13.1%) at 5 years. The median survival of 
patients with GI NECs was 7.5 months, with patients with small intestine 
tumors doing better (25.1 months) than patients with pancreatic NECs (5.7 
months) and those arising in an unknown primary site (2.5 months). 
Evaluation of Extrapulmonary Poorly Differentiated: Neuroendocrine 
Carcinoma/Large or Small Cell Carcinoma/Mixed Neuroendocrine-Non-
Neuroendocrine Neoplasm  
Multiphasic chest/abdomen/pelvis CT or chest CT and abdomen/pelvis 
MRI are recommended as baseline staging studies. Brain imaging with 
MRI or CT scan with contrast and/or FDG-PET should be performed as 
clinically indicated, and should be considered routinely in PDNECs of the 
thorax and neck. Biochemical markers are recommended if symptoms are 
suggestive of a secretory tumor. SSTR-based imaging is not part of the 
routine evaluation of PDNECs. Tumor/somatic molecular profiling should 
be considered for patients with locoregional unresectable or metastatic 
disease who are candidates for anticancer therapy to identify actionable 
alterations. Testing can be specifically considered for potentially 
actionable somatic findings including, but not limited to: NTRK fusions, 
RET fusions, BRAF V600E mutations, MSI-H, MMR deficiency, and 
TMB-H. Testing on tumor tissue is preferred; however, cell-free DNA 
testing can be considered if tumor tissue testing is not feasible.  
Treatment of Extrapulmonary Poorly Differentiated: Neuroendocrine 
Carcinoma/Large or Small Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma/Mixed 
Neuroendocrine-Non-Neuroendocrine Neoplasm 
Poorly differentiated NECs are often associated with non-neuroendocrine 
components such as adeno or squamous cell carcinoma. Management of 
these tumors is controversial. Chemotherapy regimens for non-
neuroendocrine components may be considered, although platinum-based 
therapy remains standard. 
For resectable extrapulmonary poorly differentiated NECs/large or small 
cell carcinomas/MiNENs, treatment options depend on the disease site. 
Such options may include surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy 
with or without RT; neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without RT and with 
resection; chemotherapy alone; and definitive chemoradiation (with 
cisplatin/etoposide or carboplatin/etoposide). For locoregional

unresectable disease, concurrent or sequential RT in combination with 
chemotherapy, or chemotherapy alone are recommended. 
Chemoradiation options include capecitabine (when etoposide in 
combination with platinum is not feasible), carboplatin plus etoposide, or 
cisplatin plus etoposide.347,358-362 
If metastatic disease is present, chemotherapy alone is recommended. 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for resectable, locoregional 
unresectable, or metastatic disease include carboplatin/etoposide,363 
cisplatin/etoposide,229,364 FOLFIRI,348 FOLFOX,365 and temozolomide366 
with or without capecitabine.367 For locoregional unresectable or 
metastatic disease, additional chemotherapy options include 
carboplatin/irinotecan, cisplatin/irinotecan,364 and FOLFIRINOX.350-352 
Carboplatin/etoposide363 and cisplatin/etoposide are most commonly used 
in first-line therapy.229,364 While the use of concomitant immunotherapy is 
standard in small cell lung cancer, it remains experimental in 
extrapulmonary NEC, although studies are ongoing (NCT03980925, 
NCT05058651). In addition, carboplatin/irinotecan and 
cisplatin/irinotecan364 have potential utility.350-352 The phase III TOPIC-NEC 
randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of etoposide plus cisplatin or 
irinotecan plus cisplatin in patients with advanced NECs of the digestive 
system showed that both regimens were comparable in terms of the 
median OS (etoposide/cisplatin: 12.5 months, irinotecan/cisplatin: 10.9 
months; HR, 1.04; P = .80) and median PFS (etoposide/cisplatin: 5.6 
months, irinotecan/cisplatin: 5.1 months; HR, 1.06; P = .80).349 The 
authors noted that grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurred more frequently 
in patients treated with etoposide plus cisplatin.  
It should be noted though that the efficacy of second-line or later lines of 
chemotherapy is very limited and survival is short.368 Available data are 
insufficient to guide selection of one chemotherapy regimen over another, 
although comorbidities, mutation profile, and site of primary often factor in 
to the decision. 
The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab (category 2B) is also an 
option for metastatic disease if the disease progresses following 
chemotherapy.354-356,369 The results of one phase II study (S1609 DART) 
revealed an ORR of 44% in patients with non-pancreatic high-grade NECs 
(including lung primaries) treated with combined ipilimumab and 
nivolumab.355 Subsequent data from an additional cohort of patients (N = 
19) with high-grade NENs (median Ki-67, 80%) revealed an ORR of 26% 
and a 6-month PFS of 32%.356 The median PFS was 2.0 months and the 
median OS was 8.7 months. The subgroup analysis of the CA209-538 
trial, centered on patients with advanced NENs that received the 
combined treatment, demonstrated an ORR of 24%.354 The median PFS 
was 4.8 months and the OS was 14.8 months. Immune-related toxicity 
occurred in 66% of cases. Importantly, data from the multi-cohort phase II 
DUNE study (N = 123) of durvalumab plus tremelimumab for patients with 
advanced NENs of GEP or lung origin suggested only modest activity 
(irRECIST ORR 9.1%) in G3 GEP NENs.370 The OS rate for these patients 
at 9 months was 36.1%. Furthermore, results of the NIPINEC study in 
which single-agent nivolumab was compared to combination therapy with 
nivolumab/ipilimumab revealed an ORR of 7.2% (median OS, 7.2 months; 
median PFS, 1.8 months) at 8 weeks with nivolumab, compared to an 
ORR of 14.9% (median OS, 5.8 months; median PFS, 1.9 months) with 
nivolumab/ipilimumab. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy is not approved 
for concurrent use with IV ipilimumab; however, for nivolumab 
monotherapy, nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy subcutaneous injection 
may be substituted for IV nivolumab. Nivolumab and hyaluronidase-nvhy 
has different dosing and administration instructions compared to IV 
nivolumab.

Some extrapancreatic NECs harbor an actionable mutation. Finally, 
pembrolizumab can also be considered for patients with dMMR, MSI-H, or 
TMB-H (≥10 mut/Mb as determined by an FDA-approved test) tumors that 
have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory 
alternative treatment options.342,343,371 370 
Targeted therapy is recommended based on the molecular alteration. 
Dabrafenib in combination with trametinib can be considered for patients 
with BRAF V600E mutation-positive tumors that have progressed following 
prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.372 
Entrectinib and larotrectinib can be considered for patients with NTRK 
gene fusion-positive tumors without a known acquired resistance mutation, 
that are metastatic or where surgical resection is likely to result in severe 
morbidity, and that have no satisfactory alternative treatments or that have 
progressed following treatment.373-375 Repotrectinib can be considered for 
patients with NTRK gene fusion-positive tumors that progressed on a prior 
NTRK-targeted treatment.376 Selpercatinib can be considered for patients 
with RET gene fusion-positive tumors that have progressed on or following 
prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment 
options.377 
Surveillance of Extrapulmonary Poorly Differentiated: Neuroendocrine 
Carcinoma/Large or Small Cell Carcinoma/Mixed Neuroendocrine-Non-
Neuroendocrine Neoplasm 
For patients with resectable disease, surveillance after treatment 
completion consists of a routine H&P along with appropriate imaging 
studies (chest CT with or without contrast and abdomen/pelvis MRI with 
contrast or multiphasic chest/abdomen/pelvis CT) every 12 weeks for the 
first year and every 6 months thereafter. However, patients with 
locoregional, unresectable disease and with metastatic disease should be 
monitored more closely every 6 to 16 weeks with an H&P and appropriate 
imaging studies as described above. 
Adrenal Gland Tumors 
ACCs are rare (incidence, 0.7–2 per million).378,379 ACC has a bimodal age 
distribution, with peak incidences in early childhood and the fourth to fifth 
decades of life. Females are more frequently affected (55%–60%).378,380 
Most cases are sporadic; however, ACCs have been observed in 
association with several hereditary syndromes, including Li-Fraumeni 
syndrome, Lynch syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, MEN1, and 
familial adenomatous polyposis.10,381-386 The underlying mechanisms of 
carcinogenesis in sporadic ACCs have not been fully elucidated; however, 
inactivating somatic mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene 
(chromosome 17p13387,388) and alterations at the 11p15 locus (site of the 
IGF2 gene389,390) seem to occur frequently. 
Approximately 60% of patients present with evidence of adrenal steroid 
hormone excess, with or without virilization.379 Signs and symptoms 
associated with hypersecretion of cortisol, called hypercortisolemia (± 
Cushing syndrome), include weight gain, weakness (primarily in proximal 
muscles), hypertension, psychiatric disturbances, hirsutism, centripetal 
obesity, purple striae, dorsocervical fat pad and supraclavicular fat pad 
enlargement, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Aldosterone-secreting 
tumors may present with hypertension, weakness, and hypokalemia. 
Androgen-secreting tumors in females may induce hirsutism, virilization, 
deepening of the voice, and oligo/amenorrhea.379 In males, 
estrogen-secreting tumors may induce gynecomastia and testicular 
atrophy. Hormonally inactive ACCs typically produce symptoms related to 
tumor burden, including abdominal pain, back pain, early satiety, and 
weight loss.379  
Evaluation and Treatment of Adrenal Gland Tumors 
All patients with adrenal gland tumors need biochemical evaluation and 
appropriate imaging. Biochemical evaluation to evaluate for primary

with adrenal protocol: non-contrast CT (if Hounsfield unit [HU] <+10, no 
further imaging and no screening for PCC is needed; if HU >+10, proceed 
with contrast CT with washout [depending on HU and imaging 
characteristics, additional imaging and workup may be indicated])395 or 
MRI with and without contrast. Functional evaluation should be done as 
noted above. ACCs can oftentimes secrete multiple hormones; therefore, 
if imaging is suspicious for ACC, evaluation for sex steroid in addition to 
the above evaluation is indicated. If several hormones are over-secreted, 
ACCs are more likely. 
History of a primary cancer outside of the adrenal gland raises the 
question of metastatic disease to the adrenals. However, it is very 
important that PCC is ruled out prior to considering diagnostic biopsy of 
the adrenal mass. In these patients, an image-guided needle biopsy can 
be considered only if clinical suspicion for PCC is low; plasma or urine 
fractionated metanephrines, with or without catecholamines, are normal; 
and the results will impact disease management. False-negative biopsies 
are possible; therefore, proceeding directly to surgery should be 
considered in some cases. If the tumor is determined to be a metastasis 
from another site, treatment should be according to the appropriate NCCN 
disease-specific treatment guideline (to see Treatment by Cancer Type, 
go to www.NCCN.org). If biopsy reveals adrenocortical tissue, then 
functional evaluation should proceed as described here. 
Evaluation and Treatment of Primary Aldosteronism 
When primary aldosteronism is suspected, plasma aldosterone and 
plasma renin activity should be assessed. Patients with primary 
aldosteronism have elevated plasma levels of aldosterone and low levels 
of renin activity. The plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio in patients with 
primary aldosteronism is usually >30.391 Confirmatory testing is 
recommended if positive results are obtained. Oral or IV salt loading and 
measurement of urine or plasma aldosterone is recommended to test for 
adequate suppression.396 Serum electrolytes should also be measured, 
because excessive aldosterone production causes both sodium retention 
and potassium excretion. The Endocrine Society has developed detailed 
guidelines for the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of primary 
aldosteronism,391 and these guidelines have been modified over time.397,398 
Benign primary aldosteronism is much more common and can be caused 
by a unilateral adrenal adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Adrenal 
vein sampling for aldosterone can be considered for distinguishing these 
two causes of benign primary aldosteronism and should be considered if 
the patient is a surgical candidate, because CT imaging cannot always 
differentiate between an adenoma and hyperplasia. It may be reasonable, 
however, to exclude adrenal vein sampling in patients <40 years when 
imaging only shows one affected gland, because bilateral hyperplasia is 
rare in this population. Cortisol measurement in the catheterization 
samples is used to confirm proper catheter placement. Minimally invasive 
adrenalectomy is recommended for adenoma,399 whereas medical 
management with spironolactone or eplerenone for hypertension and 
hypokalemia is recommended for patients with bilateral adrenal 
hyperplasia and for nonsurgical candidates. 
Evaluation and Treatment of Hypercortisolemia (± Cushing Syndrome) 
Patients who present with symptoms of hypercortisolemia (± Cushing 
syndrome) should be evaluated for evidence of hypercortisolemia with one

of the following tests: 1) overnight 1-mg dexamethasone suppression test; 
2) 2 to 3 midnight salivary cortisol measurements; or 3) free cortisol in a 
24-hour urine sample.392,400 Elevated levels of cortisol are indicative of 
hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome). If a diagnosis of 
hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome) is confirmed, plasma ACTH 
should be checked in the morning to determine if it is ACTH-dependent or 
ACTH-independent (ACTH <5 pg/mL). Adrenal masses that secrete 
cortisol are not mediated by ACTH (ACTH independent), and ACTH-
dependent tumors can arise in the pituitary or ectopic NET sources. If a 
clear pituitary adenoma is not visible by MRI, inferior petrosal sinus vein 
sampling can be considered to differentiate adrenal from pituitary and 
ectopic causes in ACTH-dependent hypercortisolemia (± Cushing 
syndrome). Endocrinology referral should be considered for the 
biochemical workup, localization of hypercortisolemia, and medical 
therapy for hypercortisolism until more definitive therapy can be arranged. 
Hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome) can be associated with either 
benign adrenal tumors (adrenal adenoma) or malignant adrenal tumors. 
Malignancy should be suspected if the tumor is >4 cm or is 
inhomogeneous with irregular margins and/or has local invasion or other 
malignant imaging characteristics. Some centers may use 6 cm as a cutoff 
instead of 4 cm. For these tumors, FDG-PET/CT scans, chest CT scans 
with or without contrast, and adrenal protocol (as previously described or 
MRI with and without contrast) are recommended. Benign adrenal tumors 
(ie, <4 cm, contralateral gland normal, circumscribed tumor, other benign 
imaging characteristics) should be resected. It is important that patients 
who have cortisol-secreting adrenal tumor receive perioperative 
glucocorticoids since the contralateral adrenal secretion will be transiently 
suppressed. For more details, see the Endocrine Society's Clinical 
Practice Guidelines for the Treatment of Cushing Syndrome.392 
Treatment of Nonfunctioning, Benign Adrenal Tumors 
Adrenal tumors that do not secrete hormones are often discovered 
incidentally during scans for unrelated reasons (incidentalomas). It is still 
important to evaluate for biochemical secretion of hormones for primary 
aldosteronism, hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome), and PCC and 
PGL as listed above to confirm they are non-secreting. Most 
nonfunctioning tumors are benign and can be left untreated. Masses 
showing radiographic features of myelolipoma are considered benign. In 
addition, tumors <4 cm that are homogenous, with smooth margins, and 
that appear lipid-rich according to CT or MRI criteria are also usually 
benign. A minimally invasive adrenalectomy is preferred for tumors <4 cm 
and benign-appearing lesions if resection is indicated due to tumor 
growth.399 If malignancy is suspected and the disease is localized, locally 
resectable, or regionally advanced, an open adrenalectomy is 
recommended. Metastatic disease should be treated similar to ACC. 
Evaluation of Adrenocortical Carcinoma  
ACC should be strongly suspected in tumors >4 cm with irregular margins 
or that are internally heterogeneous and if they secrete multiple 
hormones.379 On CT scans with IV contrast, adjacent lymph nodes or liver 
metastases may be present. On unenhanced CTs, the HU number is 
typically higher in carcinomas than in adenomas, and a threshold value of 
10 HU has been proposed as a means of distinguishing benign from 
malignant adrenal tumors.379 If the HU attenuation value is <10 on 
unenhanced CT, then the tumor is probably benign. If the HU attenuation 
value is >10 on unenhanced CT, then enhanced CT and washout at 15 
minutes is recommended. If the absolute washout value is >60% at 15 
minutes, the tumor is likely benign; if <60%, the tumor is possibly 
malignant.401-403 MRIs more clearly document local invasion and 
involvement of the inferior vena cava than CT scans.379 Whether CT or 
MRI scans are performed, they should be performed using an adrenal 
protocol.

FDG-PET/CT, chest CT scans with or without contrast, abdomen/pelvis 
CT or MRI scans with contrast, and a biochemical evaluation for 
hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome), primary aldosteronism, and 
androgen excess are also recommended for resectable, unresectable, or 
suspected metastatic disease.  
One study found that 5.8% of adults with ACC tested positive for Li 
Fraumeni syndrome (TP53 gene) and genetic testing should be routinely 
offered to all patients with ACC.404 Another analysis found that 
approximately 3% of patients with ACC have Lynch syndrome, leading the 
authors to recommend that patients with ACC also undergo genetic testing 
for Lynch syndrome.385 Patients with ACC may also consider MSI, MMR, 
and TMB (by an FDA-approved test) testing. Genetic counseling and 
testing for inherited genetic syndromes is also recommended. 
Treatment and Surveillance of Localized Adrenocortical Carcinoma 
Surgical resection of the tumor with removal of radiographically or clinically 
evident lymph nodes is recommended in patients with localized ACC, and 
may require removal of adjacent structures such as the liver, kidney, 
pancreas, spleen, and/or diaphragm for complete resection. Open 
adrenalectomy is recommended in tumors with a high risk of being 
malignant because of increased risk for local recurrence and peritoneal 
spread when performed laparoscopically.399,405 It is thus important to 
achieve negative margins and avoid breaching the tumor capsule.  
Because of the rarity of ACCs, no randomized, prospective trials of 
adjuvant therapy have been published. Most retrospective reports have 
examined the use of adjuvant mitotane, an oral adrenocorticolytic agent.406 
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits of mitotane after 
resection of ACC in patients without distant metastasis included five 
retrospective studies reporting on 1249 patients.407 The meta-analysis 
found benefit of adjuvant mitotane, with significantly longer relapse-free 
survival (RFS) and OS, suggesting that adjuvant mitotane may be an 
effective postoperative strategy. The phase III multicenter ADIUVO trial 
randomized 91 patients with ACCs considered to be at low to intermediate 
risk for recurrence in a 1:1 ratio to assess the efficacy of adjuvant mitotane 
compared to surveillance.408 RFS) is the primary endpoint. In the mitotane 
group, the 5-year RFS was 79%, compared to 75% in the surveillance 
group (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.30–1.85). There was no significant difference 
in terms of the 5-year OS (mitotane, 95%; surveillance, 86%). The study 
ended early due to slow recruitment.  
There are three treatment options if the patient is at high risk for local 
recurrence based on positive margins, ruptured capsule, large size, and 
high grade. A clinical trial is recommended if available. Adjuvant external 
beam RT to the tumor bed can also be considered in these cases, 
particularly if concern exists regarding tumor spillage or close margins 
after surgery. Additionally, based on the available data, adjuvant mitotane 
therapy can be considered. Adjuvant mitotane therapy can also be 
considered after resection of ACC, although its use in this setting is 
controversial (category 3). Mitotane blood levels should be monitored. 
Some institutions recommend target levels of 14 to 20 mcg/mL if tolerated. 
Steady-state levels may be reached several months after initiation of 
mitotane. Because of the adrenolytic effects of mitotane, replacement 
doses of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone) 
should be prescribed to treat adrenal insufficiency if it is used; 
corticosteroids usually are required for the rest of the patient’s life. 
Because of the potential risks and uncertain benefits of adjuvant mitotane, 
several NCCN Member Institutions do not advocate its use in the adjuvant 
treatment of patients with resected ACCs. The role of chemotherapy in the 
adjuvant setting is unproven, although enrollment to the ongoing 
ADIUVO-2 study of adjuvant mitotane with or without chemotherapy is 
encouraged (NCT03583710) for patients at high risk of recurrence post-
resection.

MS-44 
A follow-up should be performed every 12 weeks to 12 months for up to 5 
years, and then as clinically indicated. Recurrences after 5 years are 
thought to be very rare. A chest CT scan, with or without contrast, and an 
abdomen CT or MRI scan with contrast and biomarkers (if the tumor is 
initially functional) should be considered.  
Management of Locoregional Unresectable or Metastatic Adrenocortical 
Carcinoma 
Observation with chest CT scans with or without contrast, and 
abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI scans with contrast, every 12 weeks, and 
relevant biomarkers (if the tumor is initially functional) can be considered 
for clinically indolent disease, with systemic treatment initiated at tumor 
progression. Resection may be considered if >90% of the primary tumor 
and metastases can be removed, particularly if the tumor is initially 
functional. In the case of bulky disease or if <90% of the tumor is 
removable, surgery can be reconsidered following a response to systemic 
therapy.  
For locoregional unresectable or metastatic disease, local therapy may be 
considered (ie, SBRT,312 thermal ablative therapies, liver-directed 
therapies). Commonly, however, systemic therapy should be considered, 
preferably in a clinical trial. The options include mitotane monotherapy, 
various combinations of cisplatin, carboplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and 
mitotane, or pembrolizumab monotherapy.  
Mitotane monotherapy has been studied in the setting of locally advanced 
or metastatic disease.409-411 PR rates are thought to occur in 10% to 30% 
of patients.412 The optimal doses and duration of mitotane treatment for 
metastatic disease have not yet been standardized, but some institutions 
recommend target levels of 14 to 20 mcg/mL, if tolerated. Higher doses 
may be difficult for patients to tolerate, whereas lower doses may be less 
effective.412 Steady-state levels may be reached several months after 
initiation of mitotane. As noted above, because of the adrenolytic effects of 
mitotane, replacement doses of corticosteroids (hydrocortisone with or 
without fludrocortisone) should be prescribed to treat adrenal insufficiency. 
This replacement therapy is usually required for the remainder of the 
patient’s lifetime.  
Several studies have evaluated the combination of mitotane with other 
cytotoxic agents, including cisplatin and etoposide. Preferred regimens 
include cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide, with or 
without doxorubicin, and with or without mitotane. One of the larger 
studies analyzed the combination of mitotane with cisplatin, etoposide, 
and doxorubicin in 72 patients with unresectable adrenal carcinoma, 
yielding an ORR of 49% (according to WHO criteria) and a complete 
hormonal response in 16 of 42 patients with functioning tumors.413 A 
retrospective study with 43 patients in Asia with metastatic ACC treated 
with the same regimen reported a median OS of 15.4 months (95% CI, 
11.6 months – not reached) and a median PFS of 6.2 months (95% CI, 
4.3–10.0 months).414 Analysis of results from the international randomized 
controlled phase III FIRM-ACT trial comparing treatment of metastatic 
ACC with etoposide, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and mitotane versus treatment 
with streptozotocin and mitotane with a crossover design found no 
difference between the regimens in the primary endpoint of OS (14.8 vs. 
12.0 months; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.61–1.02; P = .07).415 However, 
response rates (23.2% vs. 9.2%, P < .001) and PFS (median PFS, 5.0 
months vs. 2.1 months; HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.43–0.69; P < .001) were 
improved with the 4-drug regimen and an OS benefit (17.1 vs. 4.7 months) 
was seen in those who did not cross over to the other combination. Rates 
of serious adverse events were similar in the two arms. However, the 
toxicity of concurrent chemotherapy plus mitotane should be considered 
when making treatment decisions, and mitotane monotherapy may still be 
appropriate in selected patients.

Pembrolizumab can also be considered as a single agent or in 
combination with mitotane. These regimens were preference stratified. 
Pembrolizumab, with or without mitotane, and mitotane monotherapy are 
other recommended regimens. A small phase II study investigating the 
use of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced ACCs found an ORR of 
23% and a disease control rate of 52%.416 The median OS was 24.9 
months. Another small study with 16 patients with advanced ACC 
demonstrated an ORR of 14% (95% CI, 2%–43%).417 One phase II study 
reported a 15% ORR and a 54% clinical benefit rate.418  
A follow-up with chest CT scans, with or without contrast, and 
abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI scans, with contrast, or FDG-PET/CT scans 
should be performed every 12 weeks to 12 months, up to 5 years, and 
then as clinically indicated. 
Pheochromocytomas/Paragangliomas 
Pheochromocytomas are neoplasms of the chromaffin cells of the adrenal 
medulla in 80% to 90% of cases. Ectopic/extra-adrenal PCCs that arise 
from sympathetic and para-aortic sympathetic ganglia are called 
PGLs.419,420 Pheochromocytomas and PGLs occur in 0.05% to 0.1% of 
hypertensive patients, and their combined annual incidence in the United 
States is estimated to be between 500 and 1600 cases.421 Approximately 
10% to 15% of PCCs and PGLs are malignant, but it could be up to 
40%.393,422 Pheochromocytomas release catecholamines (epinephrine and 
norepinephrine) and their metabolites metanephrine and normetanephrine, 
resulting in hypertension, arrhythmia, and/or hyperglycemia. About 40% of 
PGLs secrete catecholamines. Head and neck PGLs only secrete 
catecholamines about 5% of the time and often it is dopamine. 
The peak incidence of occurrence for PCCs is between the third and fifth 
decades of life, but they generally occur at a younger age and are more 
likely to be bilateral in patients with familial disease. Paragangliomas are 
more likely to be malignant than PCCs in the adrenal medulla (about 40% 
vs. 10%). Pheochromocytomas and PGLs associated with a familial 
syndrome tend to be more aggressive and more likely to metastasize than 
sporadic tumors.423 In fact, a study showed that 87.5% of patients 
presenting with these tumors prior to age 20 harbored a germline mutation 
in one of several genes tested if they also had metastatic disease.424 For 
those without metastases, the rate of identification of these mutations was 
still high, at 64.7%. The OS of patients with PCCs and PGLs can be 
heterogeneous, but a systematic review and meta-analysis of seven 
studies of 738 patients reported survival to be 63% at 5 years.425 
Predicting who will go on to develop metastasis is difficult, but some 
studies have reported that almost half of patients have not progressed a 
year after diagnosis.426 Delays at a median of 5.5 years with a range from 
0.3 to 53.4 years between initial diagnosis and metastasis have been 
reported in a retrospective study spanning 55 years of patients with PCCs 
or PGLs, and many such patients survive long term after treatment of 
metastatic disease.427 Thus, patients presenting during childhood, 
adolescence, or young adulthood require careful, lifelong surveillance (see 
Surveillance of Pheochromocytomas/Paragangliomas, below). 
Evaluation for Pheochromocytomas/Paragangliomas 
A patient with possible PCCs should be evaluated with fractionated 
metanephrines and normetanephrines in 24-hour urine or free 
metanephrines in plasma. Elevated levels of metanephrines or 
normetanephrines are suggestive of PCC or PGL. In general, adrenal 
PCCs more commonly secrete metanephrines and PGLs secrete 
normetanephrines, with a few exceptions.419,420 Concurrent medications 
should be reviewed before testing for those that interfere with plasma or 
blood metanephrine/normetanephrine evaluation, including 
acetaminophen, certain beta- and alpha-adrenoreceptor blocking drugs, 
serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.428 
Elevations in metanephrine or normetanephrine levels that are three times

above the upper limit of normal are diagnostic. Urine or plasma 
catecholamines are no longer routinely recommended for the evaluation of 
PCC as 15% to 20% of patients with PCC have normal levels of urine 
catecholamines due to intermittent secretion in some tumors and 
insignificant secretion by others.429 Measurement of serum and/or 24-hour 
urine-fractionated catecholamines (for dopamine) or methoxytyramine (if 
available) may be appropriate for cervical PGLs. Methoxytyramine is 
helpful as the metabolite of dopamine in cervical tumors but it is not 
commercially available in many places. Both catecholamines and 
metanephrines/normetanephrines can represent false-positive results.  
Adrenal protocol CT or MRI is recommended, if not already done. Other 
imaging studies, including multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI scans, 
SSTR-based imaging (PET/CT or PET/MRI), FDG-PET/CT scans (skull 
vertex to mid-thigh), chest CT scans with or without contrast, and 
metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans with SPECT/CT should be 
performed as appropriate if metastatic or multifocal disease is suspected. 
Data on the role of functional imaging in PCC/PGL are evolving and the 
preferred method remains unclear. CT scans are most helpful for adrenal 
masses and PGLs. However, there are some instances where extra-
adrenal PGLs are seen better with MRI scans. MIBG scans are less 
sensitive than FDG-PET and 68Ga-DOTATATE for metastatic and 
multifocal PCCs/PGLs (in patients with VHL and SDH syndromes but not 
in those with MEN1 or neurofibromatosis type 1 syndromes or some 
patients with sporadic PCCs).430 SPECT/CT imaging of involved sites is 
recommended. Obtain an MIBG scan if considering treatment with I131-
MIBG. 
Genetic Counseling/Testing in Pheochromocytomas/Paragangliomas 
While many PCCs and PGLs are thought to be sporadic, increasing 
evidence shows that a number of PCCs and PGLs are in fact associated 
with inherited genetic syndromes.421,431 Pheochromocytomas occur in 
patients with MEN2A, MEN2B, and other familial diseases such as 
neurofibromatosis and VHL syndrome (see Principles of Hereditary 
Cancer Risk Assessment and Genetic Counseling in the algorithm). 
Paragangliomas are also associated with polycythemia-paraganglioma-
somatostatinoma syndrome due to somatic mutations in the HIF2A 
gene.432,433 In addition to germline mutations associated with these 
syndromes (ie, RET, NF1, VHL), germline mutations in SDHB, SDHA, 
SDHAF2, SDHD, SDHC, TMEM127, MAX, FH, and MDH2 have also been 
associated with an increased incidence of PCCs and PGLs.422,431-437 SDHB 
gene mutations are associated with a 40% to 60% risk of developing 
metastatic disease.422 Patients <45 years of age or those with multifocal, 
bilateral, or recurrent lesions are more likely to have a heritable mutation, 
although many individuals with a hereditary syndrome present with solitary 
disease and no family history.437 Because a significant proportion of 
patients with a PCC or PGL have a heritable mutation,431 genetic 
counseling is recommended in patients with such a diagnosis and in those 
with a family history of these tumors, with genetic testing when 
appropriate.  
Individuals with known germline mutations associated with PCCs and 
PGLs should undergo lifelong biochemical and clinical screening, 
beginning at around ages 6 to 8 years.437 Surveillance should start at 6 to 
10 years for patients with SDHB mutations and 10 to 15 years for those 
with all other forms of hereditary PCC/PGL. The type and timing of the 
surveillance should be based on which gene is affected and take into 
account known genotype-phenotype relationships. MRI may be the 
preferable imaging modality for tumor detection in these individuals in 
order to limit radiation exposure.419,420

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-47 
Treatment of Pheochromocytomas/Paragangliomas 
Medical Preparation for Treatment 
Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for both benign and 
malignant PCCs and PGLs. Surgery or stress can cause a sudden release 
of large amounts of catecholamines, causing very significant and 
sometimes life-threatening hypertension. Alpha blockade is necessary 
treatment for all hormonally secreting PCCs and PGLs regardless of 
clinical symptoms. If additional treatments are planned, patients may need 
medication adjustments. Therefore, patients with PCCs or PGLs should 
receive alpha-adrenergic blockade with aggressive volume repletion and 
high-salt diet for 7 to 14 days or until stable as medical preparation for 
treatment. Alpha 1-selective receptor blockers include terazosin, 
doxazosin, and prazosin, and non-selective receptor blockers include 
phenoxybenzamine. Medications that will precipitate a hormone-mediated 
crisis should be avoided. If the patient has a hypertensive crisis, consider 
the addition of nitroprusside, phentolamine, or nicardipine for the treatment 
of hypertension. Cardiac arrhythmias can be managed with esmolol or 
lidocaine. Hypoglycemia and hypotension can be seen postoperatively. 
Treatment with IV fluids for volume expansion with the inclusion of 
dextrose for glucose levels is recommended.  
If additional blood pressure control is needed after alpha blockade, the 
addition of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can be used. Calcium 
channel blockers are not recommended as monotherapy unless the 
patient cannot tolerate alpha blockade. Metyrosine can be used in addition 
to alpha blockade to control blood pressure. Beta blockade (B1-selective 
blockers or non-selective beta-blockers) can also be added to alpha 
blockade to control tachycardia. Generally, alpha- and beta-blockers 
should be administered independently, and use of combination 
beta-/alpha-blockers is not recommended. Non-selective alpha blockade 
phentolamine (IV) can be used intraoperatively for additional blood 
pressure control. Doxazosin has a longer half-life and is oftentimes more 
available than some of the other agents.  
Treatment Recommendations 
Resection is the recommended treatment for patients with resectable 
tumors. A minimally invasive approach, when safe and feasible, is the 
preferred treatment for adrenal medullary tumors, including PCCs.438-440  
For locally unresectable tumors or distant metastatic disease,441 
observation is recommended, if the disease is asymptomatic or is 
slow-growing with low volume. There are limited treatment options for 
advanced tumors. For locally unresectable or distant metastatic secreting 
tumors, alpha blockade should be continued along with one of the 
following options: enrollment in a clinical trial; RT with or without 
cytoreductive (R2) resection, when possible (for locally unresectable 
tumors); cytoreductive (R2) resection, when possible (for distant 
metastatic tumors); systemic therapy; or palliative RT (for oligometastatic

are limited and clinical trials are ongoing (NCT03946527). If injection site-
related complications occur, consider switching to another SSA.  
Radioligand therapy has been studied for a number of years. A review of 
48 patients with PCC or PGL treated with 131I-MIBG therapy at four 
centers showed that, while PRs were rare, stable disease was achieved 
after 83.1% of treatments.452 Of 16 patients with refractory PCC and PGL 
treated with 131I-MIBG, 23.5% (90% CI, 8.5%–46.1%; P = .009) achieved 
a biochemical response, defined as a ≥50% reduction in urine 
catecholamines. Five point nine percent (90% CI, 0.3%–25.0%) and 
29.4% (90% CI, 12.4%–52.2%) of patients achieved a radiographic 
response rate, as determined by CT/MRI based on RECIST version 1.1 
and 123I-MIBG scintigraphy, respectively.453 A meta-analysis of 17 studies 
that included a total of 243 patients with malignant PCC or PGL found a 
stable disease rate of 52% (95% CI, 0.41–0.62) after 131I-MIBG 
therapy.454 PRs and CRs were seen in 27% and 3% of patients, 
respectively.  
The results of a phase 2, open-label, multicenter study investigating HSA 
iobenguane I-131 to treat patients with malignant, recurrent, and/or 
unresectable PCC or PGL revealed that the primary endpoint (a reduction 
in antihypertension medication by at least half) was met by 25% of all 
patients who received at least one therapeutic dose (n = 68) and 32% of 
patients who received two therapeutic doses (n = 50).444 The objective 
tumor response was evaluated as a secondary endpoint. Overall, 23% of 
patients had PR, which went up to 30% in patients who received two 
therapeutic doses, and 68% of patients had stable disease. The median 
OS was almost 37 months in patients who received at least one 
therapeutic dose. The most commonly reported side effects in patients 
who received any dose of HSA iobenguane I-131 were nausea, 
myelosuppression, and fatigue. In 2018, HSA iobenguane I-131 became 
an FDA-approved option for patients who have an MIBG-positive scan; 
have unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic PCC or PGL; and 
require systemic anticancer therapy. However, the drug has not been 
available in the United States since 2024. 
A study of 20 patients with high SSTR expressing PCC or PGL treated 
with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate assessed the effectiveness of PRRT in 
controlling hypertension.455 Most patients receiving PRRT saw no change 
in medication to treat hypertension. The median PFS was 39 months and 
median OS was not reached with a median follow-up time of 28 months. A 
systematic review and meta-analysis of 201 patients with inoperable or 
metastatic PCCs or PGLs determined that treatment with PRRT led to an 
ORR of 25% (95% CI, 19%–32%) and a disease control rate of 84% (95% 
CI, 77%–89%).456 Clinical responses were reported in 61% of patients. In 
a retrospective analysis of 15 patients with unresectable or metastatic 
PCC and PGL treated with PRRT with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, 20% of 
patients had progressive disease, while 53% had stable disease.450    
An ENETS Centre study with 22 patients with progressive or metastatic 
PCCs or PGLs treated patients with PRRT with either 90Y-dotatate or 
lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, and 131I-MIBG.457 Patients treated with PRRT 
had increased PFS and treatment response compared to 131I-MIBG 
treatment, but no significant differences were seen in OS. Other case 
studies have been presented at conferences458-460 or published461,462 that 
have also shown improvements in patients with high SSTR expressing 
PCC or PGL treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate. A retrospective study of 
22 patients (2 localized and 20 metastatic) with PCC and PGL determined 
that treatment with PRRT with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate resulted in 
improved outcomes.451 The median OS and median PFS were 49.6 
months and 21.6 months, respectively. Forty-seven percent of patients 
achieved a scintigraphic response of >50%. Forty percent of patients 
achieved a biochemical response (>50% reduction) for chromogranin A 
and 25% of patients achieved a biochemical response for catecholamines.

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-49 
In a subgroup analysis, Ki-67 <15% was associated with improved OS (P 
= .013) and PFS (P = .005). Prospective studies assessing the use of Lu 
177 dotatate PRRT and other radioligand therapies in PCCs/PGLs are 
ongoing (NCT03206060, NCT06045260, NCT05636618). 
A retrospective review of 52 evaluable patients treated with various 
systemic chemotherapy regimens for metastatic PCCs or PGLs showed 
that patients with a response to chemotherapy (reduction in symptoms, 
antihypertensive medications, or tumor size) had a median survival of 6.4 
years and non-responders had a median survival of 3.7 years.447 
Approximately 33% of patients exhibited a tumor response. In a long-term 
follow-up of 18 patients with metastatic PCCs or PGLs treated with CVD, 
11% of patients had a CR, while 44% had a PR.463 Temozolomide has 
also demonstrated efficacy in patients with PCCs or PGLs, especially in 
those with the SDHB mutation (although this finding needs to be 
validated). 448,464 A randomized study of temozolomide with or without a 
PARP inhibitor is ongoing (NCT04394858). 
In the phase II FIRSTMAPPP study, patients with metastatic PCCs and 
PGLs were randomized 1:1 to receive sunitinib at a dose of 37.5 mg/day 
or placebo.445 Sunitinib demonstrated antitumor activity in these patients. 
The 12-month PFS rate (primary endpoint) was 36% (90% CI, 23%–50%) 
in the sunitinib arm and 19% (90% CI, 11%–31%) in the placebo arm. 
Patients treated with sunitinib had a median PFS of 8.9 months (placebo, 
3.6 months), median OS of 26.1 months (placebo, 49.5), and an ORR of 
36.1% (placebo, 8.3%). Sunitinib was also evaluated in the non-
randomized SUTNET clinical trial in 50 patients with metastatic or 
unresectable PCCs/PGLs.465 The 12-month PFS rate (primary endpoint) 
was 53.4% (5% CI, 41.1–69.3) and the median PFS was 14.1 months 
(95% CI, 8.9–25.7). The ORR was 15.6% and the median OS was 49 
months (95% CI, 21.2–NA). Of note, sunitinib was used at a dose to 50 
mg/day for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week break, in this study. Other 
VEGF TKIs may also have activity in PCCs/PGLs and are currently under 
study.466  
Surveillance of Pheochromocytomas/Paragangliomas 
Surveillance intervals for patients with PCCs or PGLs are similar to those 
for other NETs. Following complete resection, H&P should be performed 
and blood pressure and tumor markers should be measured after 12 
weeks to 12 months, then every 6 to 12 months for the first 3 years, and 
then annually for up to 10 years. After 10 years, surveillance should be 
considered as clinically indicated. In addition, chest CT scans with or 
without contrast, and abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI scans with contrast can 
be considered. Timing for these surveillance events and procedures can 
be earlier if symptoms dictate or less frequently if the disease is stable and 
there are no new symptoms. Both catecholamines and 
metanephrines/normetanephrines can represent false-positive results. 
Concurrent medications should be reviewed to identify those that may 
interfere with plasma metanephrines evaluation. Evaluations that are 3 
times above the upper limit of normal are diagnostic. Surveillance for 
cervical PGL should be done as previously described. For locally 
unresectable disease or distant metastases, H&P should be performed 
and blood pressure and plasma-free or 24-hour urine-fractionated 
metanephrines and normetanephrines should be measured. 
Chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scans with contrast; chest CT scans (with or 
without contrast) and abdomen/pelvis MRI scans without contrast (if the 
patient is at risk for a hypertensive episode); MIBG with SPECT/CT (if 
there is a previous MIBG-positive scan or concern for disease 
progression) prior to considering radionuclide therapy; FDG-PET/CT 
scans (for bone dominant disease); or SSTR-based imaging (if there is a 
previous SSTR-positive scan or concern for disease progression prior to 
considering radionuclide therapy) can be considered. In addition, 
individuals with hereditary PCC/PGL may require more frequent and 
longer follow-up (see Principles of Hereditary Cancer Risk Assessment

and Genetic Counseling in the algorithm). For cervical PGLs, surveillance 
recommendations are the same as described in the evaluation section.  
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia  
The MEN syndromes are characterized by tumors that arise from 
endocrine organs and cells throughout the body. The two most common 
syndromes are MEN1 and MEN2. MEN1 is an autosomal-dominant 
inherited syndrome characterized by hyperparathyroidism (most 
commonly 4-gland hyperplasia), pituitary adenomas, and PanNETs; MEN1 
may also be associated with NETs of the lung and thymus, adrenal 
tumors, multiple lipomas, and cutaneous angiomas. MEN2 is also an 
autosomal-dominant inherited syndrome and is associated with MTC 
(98%); PCC (50%), often bilateral; and hyperparathyroidism (25%). In 
addition, familial MTC occurs in patients without MEN2 and is inherited as 
an autosomal dominant disease. 
MEN1 is associated with the germline mutation or inactivation of the tumor 
suppressor gene MEN1 (chromosomal locus 11q13 encoding the menin 
protein),467 whereas MEN2 and familial MTC are associated with germline 
mutations of the proto-oncogene, RET (chromosomal locus 10q11.2), that 
lead to activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor, RET.468 Somatic 
mutation of the MEN1 gene is also the most common known genetic 
alteration in sporadic parathyroid adenomas, gastrinomas, insulinomas, 
and bronchial NETs.10 Somatic RET mutations are found in sporadic 
MTC.469  
MEN1 
MEN1 (or Wermer syndrome) is typically characterized by tumors of the 
parathyroid and pituitary glands; NETs of the pancreas, thymus, bronchi, 
or GI tract; adrenal tumors; and/or multiple lipomas and skin angiomas. 
Over 98% of patients with MEN1 either have or will develop primary 
hyperparathyroidism, and about 50% will develop symptoms from 
functioning benign or malignant neoplasms of the pancreas.10 About 30% 
to 40% of patients have functioning tumors of the pituitary, and an 
additional 20% to 55% of patients also have or will develop nonfunctioning 
PanNETs.470  Approximately 2% of patients with MEN1 develop thymic or 
bronchopulmonary NETs.471 Thymic and duodenopancreatic 
neuroendocrine neoplasias are the leading cause of death in patients with 
MEN1.472 Approximately 30% of patients with MEN1 die from NETs.471 
Examples of functional syndromes include hypercalcemia related to 
parathyroid hyperplasia; galactorrhea or amenorrhea associated with a 
prolactinoma; Zollinger-Ellison syndrome associated with gastrinoma and 
hypersecretion of gastrin; and hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome) or 
acromegaly related to a pituitary tumor or solitary or bilateral adrenal 
tumors. Ectopic hypercortisolemia (± Cushing syndrome) may be caused 
by a NET of the pancreas, thymus, or bronchus, or by an MTC. In addition, 
although rare, patients may develop symptoms as a result of an excess of 
several hormones from more than one gland, such as hyperparathyroidism 
and a simultaneous gastrinoma, insulinoma, or a functioning pituitary 
tumor. However, in most patients, a single hormonal syndrome dominates 
the clinical picture. 
About 80% of patients with MEN1 and hypoglycemia related to insulinoma 
have multiple islet cell neoplasms. Patients with MEN1 and 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome also frequently have more than one tumor. Of 
these tumors, 70% are gastrin-secreting NETs in the duodenum and/or 
periduodenal lymph nodes. Nonfunctioning PanNETs are usually larger 
when clinically detected, and are more likely to be associated with 
metastases at the time of presentation. The development of metastatic 
NETs of the pancreas or thymus are the most common causes of death 
associated with MEN1. The clinical characteristics of pancreatic endocrine 
tumors are summarized under Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Pancreas 
(Well-Differentiated Grade 1-2), above.

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-51 
Evaluation of MEN1 Syndromes 
A clinical diagnosis for MEN1 can be made when an individual patient has 
two or more MEN1-associated tumors (ie, multi-gland parathyroid 
hyperplasia, enteropancreatic NETs, pituitary tumors).471 For patients 
known or suspected to have MEN1, clinical evaluation includes 
biochemical evaluation of hormone levels and imaging to localize the site 
of tumors. In particular, patients should be evaluated for parathyroid 
tumors, PanNETs, pituitary tumors, and lung/thymic NETs (see below). In 
addition, genetic counseling and testing for inherited genetic syndromes 
should be provided (see Genetic Counseling/Testing in MEN1, below). 
Evaluation for Parathyroid Tumors in MEN1 
Primary hyperparathyroidism associated with parathyroid adenomas is the 
most common manifestation of MEN1. Measurement of serum calcium 
levels is recommended if hyperparathyroidism is suspected. If calcium 
levels are elevated, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 25-OH vitamin D 
levels should be checked.  
Imaging of parathyroid glands is less helpful in MEN1 because of the 
multiple gland hyperplasia.471 Imaging of the parathyroid glands using 
neck ultrasound, 4-D CT, or sestamibi scanning with SPECT is 
recommended if calcium levels are elevated and may aid in identifying 
ectopically situated parathyroid glands. Preference of scan will depend on 
institutional practice/protocol.  
The technetium 99m (Tc 99m) sestamibi and ultrasound scanning are 
about 80% and 70% sensitive, respectively, for identifying solitary 
parathyroid adenomas found in most patients with sporadic 
hyperparathyroidism. However, these scans are only about 35% accurate 
in patients with familial hyperparathyroidism and 4-gland hyperplasia. 
Neither scan can distinguish between adenomatous and hyperplastic 
parathyroid glands. Because most patients with familial 
hyperparathyroidism have multiple abnormal parathyroid glands, 
preoperative localization studies are less accurate and abnormal 
parathyroid glands are best identified during surgery.473,474 Tc 99m 
sestamibi with SPECT can improve sensitivity and specificity compared to 
planar scan.475  
Four-dimensional (4D-CT) is a method of multiphase CT imaging that uses 
a fourth dimension of changes in contrast attenuation over time and is 
increasingly used for preoperative imaging.476 It has 60% to 87% 
sensitivity and allows for more robust diagnostic accuracy than traditional 
sonography or nuclear scintigraphy techniques. Three- or four-phase CT 
scanning protocols consist of precontrast, arterial, early-delayed, and late-
delayed phases.  
Evaluation for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors in MEN1  
Approximately 75% of patients with MEN1 and PanNETs have associated 
symptoms of hormone hypersecretion. The various characteristics of 
endocrine tumors of the pancreas (eg, gastrinoma, insulinoma, 
glucagonoma, VIPoma, somatostatinoma) are summarized under 
Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Pancreas (Well-Differentiated Grade 1-2), 
above. The workup for PanNETs in the context of MEN1 is similar to that 
for sporadic PanNETs. Biochemical evaluation as clinically indicated and 
multiphasic abdomen, with or without pelvis, CT or MRI are 
recommended. Imaging with EUS and SSTR-based imaging can be used 
as appropriate if there are equivocal CT findings. In particular, EUS is 
recommended if resection is being considered to preoperatively assess 
and localize tumors. For details on the evaluation for pancreatic tumors, 
see Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Pancreas (Well-Differentiated Grade 1-
2), above.

NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2025 
Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-52 
Evaluation for Pituitary Tumors in MEN1 
Pituitary or sella MRI with contrast is recommended when evaluating for 
pituitary tumors. Various laboratory tests are also used to evaluate for 
suspected pituitary tumors. The Panel recommends testing serum insulin-
like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (category 2B), serum prolactin, luteinizing 
hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone, alpha subunits, thyroid-
stimulating hormone and free T4, and plasma ACTH. Elevated prolactin 
levels are indicative of prolactinoma, and increased IGF-1 occurs in 
acromegaly. 
Evaluation for Lung/Thymic Neuroendocrine Tumors in MEN1  
Chest CT with contrast and multiphasic abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI are 
recommended to evaluate for lung or thymic NETs in patients with MEN1. 
Other biochemical evaluation should be done as clinically indicated. 
Genetic Counseling/Testing in MEN1 
Genetic counseling and testing for inherited genetic syndromes should be 
offered to individuals with a clinical diagnosis of MEN1 (see Evaluation of 
MEN1 Syndromes, above). Genetic risk evaluation and genetic testing for 
hereditary endocrine neoplasia syndromes is also recommended in a 
patient with clinical suspicion for MEN1 with ≥2 of the following, or 1 of the 
following and a family history of ≥1 of the following: primary 
hyperparathyroidism, duodenal NET/PanNET, pituitary adenoma, or 
foregut carcinoid (lung, thymic, or gastric). It should be noted that a 
germline MEN1 mutation is uncommon in individuals with a single 
MEN1-associated tumor and no family history. Only 10% of patients with 
MEN1 have a de novo germline mutation in MEN1, and thus no family 
history of MEN1-associated tumors. 
Treatment of MEN1 Syndromes 
Primary therapy of locoregional disease in patients with MEN1 focuses on 
treatment of the specific hormonal syndrome and/or treatment of the 
underlying hyperplasia or tumor. When a patient presents with 
hyperparathyroidism and PanNETs, the hyperparathyroidism is usually 
treated first. A consultation with an endocrinologist for all patients with 
MEN1 should be considered.  
Treatment of Parathyroid Tumors in MEN1 
Treatment options for parathyroid hyperplasia in patients with MEN1 
include subtotal parathyroidectomy with or without cryopreservation of 
parathyroid tissue with or without thymectomy (the bilateral upper thymus 
is a common site of ectopic parathyroid glands and thymic NETs). Total 
parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue with or 
without cryopreservation of parathyroid glands, and with or without 
thymectomy, is another recommended option.477-479 A randomized, 
prospective trial compared these surgical approaches in 32 patients with 
MEN1 and hyperparathyroidism.480 No significant differences were 
observed in outcomes including recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Adverse 
outcomes include persistent hyperparathyroidism (2%–5%) and 
hypocalcemia (1%) because of inadequate or excessive resection, 
respectively, even by expert surgeons. Additionally, postoperative 
bleeding or hoarseness due to injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve may 
occur in about 1% of patients.  
Treatment of Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors in MEN1 
Treatment of PanNETs associated with MEN1 is similar to sporadic 
PanNETs and focuses on surgical excision preceded by medical 
management if necessary (see relevant site-specific recommendations in 
Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Pancreas (Well-Differentiated Grade 1-2), 
above). However, in contrast to patients with sporadic disease where a 
tumor is usually solitary, PanNETs associated with MEN1 are frequently 
multiple.481 Removal of a single functioning tumor, although a reasonable 
approach for sporadic tumors, may miss additional tumors in the setting of 
MEN1. MEN1-associated metastatic PanNETs are often slower growing

than metastatic sporadic tumors. Observation can be considered for non-
functioning, indolent tumors. Surgical resection should be considered in 
cases of: 1) symptomatic functional tumors refractory to medical 
management; 2) a tumor >2 cm in size; or 3) a tumor with a relatively rapid 
rate of growth over 6 to 12 months. The Panel recommends endoscopy 
with EUS prior to pancreatic surgery to preoperatively assess and localize 
tumors.  
For clinically significant progressive disease or symptomatic patients, 
treatment options are as for metastatic disease in the sporadic setting (see 
Management of Locoregional Advanced and/or Metastatic Neuroendocrine 
Tumors of the Pancreas (Well-Differentiated Grade 1-2), above). 
All patients who might require splenectomy should receive trivalent 
vaccine (ie, pneumococcus, haemophilus influenzae type b, 
meningococcal group C) preoperatively. Furthermore, in patients with 
advanced NETs undergoing abdominal surgery in whom long-term SSA 
treatment is planned, prophylactic cholecystectomy is recommended due 
to a higher risk of cholelithiasis in patients receiving SSAs.137 Metastatic 
disease in patients with MEN1 is treated as in patients with NETs arising 
sporadically, according to the appropriate tumor type. 
Treatment of Pituitary Tumors in MEN1 
The Panel recommends considering a consultation with endocrinology for 
the treatment of patients with pituitary tumors associated with MEN1, 
including those with prolactinoma, hypercortisolemia (± Cushing 
syndrome), acromegaly, and nonfunctioning tumors. 
Treatment of Lung/Thymic Neuroendocrine Tumors in MEN1 
The recommendations for the workup and treatment of lung and thymic 
NETs are the same as for patients with sporadic disease [see 
Neuroendocrine Tumors of the Gastrointestinal Tract (Well-Differentiated 
Grade 1/2), Lung, and Thymus in the algorithm]. 
MEN1 Surveillance 
All patients with MEN1 should be followed for the development or 
progression of MEN1-associated tumors, starting at 8 to 15 years of 
age,482-486 regardless of previous tumors or treatments. In contrast to 
sporadic hyperparathyroidism, patients with familial hyperparathyroidism 
(including MEN1), isolated familial hyperparathyroidism, or 
hyperparathyroidism associated with jaw tumor syndrome are more likely 
to develop recurrent disease.487 Consider referral to an endocrinologist. 
The patients are also more likely to have or develop new parathyroid 
carcinomas, PanNETs, pituitary tumors, and/or bronchial/thymic tumors. 
Carcinoid (neuroendocrine) tumors occur in approximately 3% of patients 
with MEN1.471 Bronchial NETs occur more frequently in females, while 
thymic NETs occur more frequently in males. In addition, individuals who 
smoke appear to be at increased risk for the development of thymic 
NETs.471 In one prospective study, the authors compared the use of 
lanreotide to active surveillance in patients with MEN1-associated 
PanNETs <2 cm.488 The results revealed that lanreotide treatment 
significantly improves the median PFS (median not reached vs. 40 
months).   
The Panel recommends annual calcium levels to screen for parathyroid 
tumors. If calcium levels rise, PTH and 25-OH vitamin D should be 
measured and re-imaging with neck ultrasound and/or parathyroid 
sestamibi with SPECT scan (SPECT-CT preferred) or 4D-CT should be 
performed. Cross-sectional CT or MRI with contrast of the neck can also 
be considered. For prolonged surveillance, studies without radiation are 
preferred.  
Surveillance for MEN-1–associated PanNETs is accomplished by 
following serum hormones as symptoms indicate or if they were previously

elevated. Cross-sectional imaging with abdomen/pelvis CT or MRI with 
contrast every 1 to 3 years or serial EUS can also be considered in 
patients with MEN1. Surveillance for pituitary tumors includes a pituitary or 
sella MRI with contrast of the pituitary every 3 to 5 years. Prolactin, IGF-1, 
and other previously abnormal pituitary hormones should be followed 
every 3 to 5 years or as symptoms indicate. For surveillance of lung or 
thymic NETs, the Panel suggests that cross-sectional chest CT or MRI 
with contrast be considered every 1 to 3 years. For prolonged surveillance, 
studies without radiation are preferred. All close family members of 
patients with MEN1 should receive genetic counseling, and genetic testing 
should be considered as described above.

MEN2 is caused by a germline mutation in the RET proto-oncogene and 
can be further subdivided into MEN2A (Sipple syndrome) and MEN2B 
based on the spectrum of accompanying endocrine tumors and disorders. 
MTC is seen in nearly all patients with MEN2A and MEN2B and is often 
the first manifestation of the syndrome.237 Patients with MEN2A may also 
have or develop PCC (usually bilateral, 50%) and hyperparathyroidism 
(about 25%).237 Some patients with MEN2A have lichen planus 
amyloidosis or Hirschsprung disease. Most patients with MEN2B have 
mucosal neuromas or intestinal ganglioneuromas in addition to MTC; 50% 
of these patients have PCC, but almost none have hyperparathyroidism 
(<1%).237 Nearly all patients with MEN2B have Marfanoid habitus and/or 
poor dentition. Some patients also have ectopic lenses in the eye or very 
flexible joints. 
MTC is a calcitonin-secreting tumor of the parafollicular or C cells of the 
thyroid, accounting for about 4% to 7% of thyroid cancers but about 15% 
of all thyroid cancer deaths. About 75% of MTC cases are sporadic, 
whereas approximately 25% are considered familial or hereditary. Familial 
MTC associated with MEN2 normally arises in the first to third decades of 
life, but sporadic MTC is typically diagnosed in the fourth to fifth decades 
of life. All types of familial MTC are typically multifocal and preceded by 
C-cell hyperplasia; however, sporadic MTC is usually unifocal. Familial 
MTC arising in the absence of other endocrine malignancies or disorders 
is the least aggressive, whereas MTC associated with MEN2B is the most 
aggressive. MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial MTC are all autosomal-
dominant inherited diseases and are associated with germline mutations 
of the proto-oncogene, RET.11,489 
The initial symptoms associated with MEN2A and MEN2B include a mass 
in the thyroid gland (with or without adjacent central or lateral cervical 
lymph node adenopathy) and, less frequently, symptoms of excess 
hormone production related to MTC (such as diarrhea and facial flushing), 
PCC (headaches, increased perspiration, and rapid heart rate), or 
hyperparathyroidism. For a full discussion of the management of MTC 
(including the use of selective RET inhibitors), consult the NCCN 
Guidelines for Thyroid Carcinoma (available at www.NCCN.org). The 
following discussion focuses on the presentation of MEN2 and on the 
issues unique to MTC in this setting. 
Evaluation of MEN2A, MEN2B, and Familial MTC 
A clinical diagnosis of MEN2A includes findings of ≥2 MEN2A-associated 
tumors (MTC, PCC, or hyperparathyroidism) in a single individual or in 
first-degree relatives.490,491 A clinical diagnosis of MEN2B includes the 
presence of MTC, PCC, mucosal neuromas of the lips and tongue, 
medullated corneal nerve fibers, distinctive facies with enlarged lips, 
Marfanoid body habitus, or the inability to cry tears.490,491 Genetic 
counseling and testing for inherited genetic syndromes should be offered 
to individuals with a clinical diagnosis of MEN2.  
Before surgical resection of MTC in these patients, basal calcitonin and 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels should be measured, because 
these test results help guide the extent of nodal dissection required,

Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors 
MS-55 
particularly in patients with occult disease detected by screening. Patients 
with low calcitonin and high CEA levels usually have more aggressive 
tumors. Neck ultrasound of thyroid and cervical lymph nodes should also 
be performed to document intrathyroidal tumors and to possibly identify 
cervical lymph node metastases. 
For patients with MEN2 who have a parathyroid tumor, serum calcium 
level should be measured. If it is found to be elevated, PTH and 25-OH 
vitamin D levels should be measured. A neck ultrasound, parathyroid 
sestamibi scan with SPECT, or 4D-CT is also recommended. Preference 
of scan will depend on institutional practice/protocol. 
Patients with MEN2 should be evaluated for a coexisting PCC (see 
Evaluation for Pheochromocytomas/Paragangliomas, above) before 
administration of anesthetic or before any invasive procedure. Patients 
should be evaluated with plasma-free or 24-hour urine-fractionated 
metanephrines and normetanephrines. Concurrent medications should be 
reviewed for those that may interfere with plasma metanephrines 
evaluation. Elevations that are three times above the upper limit of normal 
are diagnostic. Both catecholamines and 
metanephrines/normetanephrines can represent false-positive results. 
Because patients with PCC have persistent vasoconstriction, medical 
therapy (ie, alpha blockade with volume repletion, high salt diet, additional 
therapy as needed) is required preoperatively (see Treatment of 
Pheochromocytomas/Paragangliomas, above).  
Genetic Counseling/Testing in MEN2 
Genetic counseling and testing for inherited genetic syndromes should be 
offered to individuals with a clinical diagnosis of MEN2 (see Evaluation of 
MEN2A, MEN2B, and Familial MTC, above). Surveillance PCC/PGL 
should start by age 11 for children in the American Thyroid Association 
high- and highest-risk categories and by age 16 in children in the 
moderate risk category.492 Surveillance comprises an annual 
measurement of plasma-free metanephrines or 24-hour urine for 
fractionated metanephrines and adrenal imaging with CT or MRI in 
patients with positive biochemical results.492  
Treatment of MEN2A, MEN2B, and Familial MTC 
The treatment of MTC associated with MEN2 is similar to the management 
of its sporadic counterpart (see the NCCN Guidelines for Thyroid 
Carcinoma, available at www.NCCN.org). However, patients with familial 
disease are much more likely to have bilateral thyroid carcinomas. In 
addition, patients may have synchronous PCC and MTC. In these cases, 
resection of PCC should take priority over thyroidectomy.  
Patients with MEN2 and familial MTC may be prone to hypoparathyroidism 
because the thyroid gland is often already removed prophylactically or for 
treatment of C-cell hyperplasia or MTC. The consensus of the Panel is for 
parathyroidectomy of abnormal glands. Subtotal parathyroidectomy is 
recommended when all glands appear abnormal. Some surgeons 
recommend prophylactic parathyroidectomy of all normal parathyroid 
glands with immediate autotransplantation in patients with MTC, while 
others believe the risk of hypoparathyroidism with this approach (about 
6%) is too high to warrant the procedure. If a normal parathyroid gland is 
not preserved in situ in patients with MEN2A, it can be autotransplanted to 
the forearm, since recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism occurs in almost 
20% of these patients. If hyperparathyroidism recurs with a documented 
elevated PTH level in the ipsilateral basilic vein, the tumor can be removed 
or subtotally resected. 
The comprehensive care of patients with PCC and MEN2 is similar to that 
of PCC in other settings.493 As patients with MEN2 have an appreciable 
risk for bilateral tumors, a cortical-sparing adrenalectomy may be 
considered. For synchronous bilateral PCCs, a bilateral adrenalectomy is 
recommended. An interesting retrospective, population-based, 
observational study of 563 patients with MEN2 and PCC from 30 centers

across three continents found that adrenal-sparing resections led to similar 
rates of recurrence with lower rates of adrenal insufficiency or steroid 
dependency (43% vs. 86%).494 More studies are needed, however, before 
this approach can be routinely recommended.  
Emerging data suggest that RET kinase inhibitors have activity in patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic PCC harboring a RET gene fusion that 
has progressed on or following prior systemic treatment.495 Of six patients 
treated with selpercatinib in the LIBRETTO-001 trial, a PR or better was 
reported in 4/6 (67%). 
MEN2 Surveillance 
Follow-up surveillance is described in the NCCN Guidelines for Thyroid 
Carcinoma (available at www.NCCN.org) for patients with RET mutations 
treated for MTC or for patients who have undergone parathyroidectomy. 
Follow-up for treatment of PCCs in these patients is similar to patients who 
have sporadic disease (see Surveillance of 
Pheochromocytomas/Paragangliomas above).  
Future Trial Design 
Recent successes have shown that large randomized controlled trials 
studying treatments for NETs can provide practice-changing results. 
Current recommendations for clinical trials in NETs stem from the 2021 
National Cancer Institute NET clinical trials planning meeting and include 
the following496: 
• 
Clinical trials for bronchial, midgut, and pancreatic NETs should be 
done separately and if not feasible, patients should be stratified 
according to site of origin and/or enrolled into cohorts of pancreatic 
and extrapancreatic NET.  
• 
Well-differentiated NETs and poorly differentiated NECs should be 
studied in separate trials. 
• 
Clinical trials for well-differentiated NETs should be stratified based 
on tumor grade or individuals should be enrolled into cohorts 
based on grade (eg, G1/2 vs. G3).  
• 
Trials should take into account the number of previous lines or 
types of therapy.  
• 
For randomized trials that use a placebo as control, crossover at 
the time of disease progression for individuals treated with placebo 
should be considered.  
• 
Protocols of trials evaluating SSTR-targeted therapies should 
clearly define SSTR-positive disease and account for variability in 
SSTR expression.  
• 
PFS is an appropriate primary endpoint for phase III trials in 
well-differentiated NETs. 
• 
OS may be an appropriate endpoint for phase II and III trials in 
individuals with poorly differentiated NECs. 
• 
Correlative studies can be included to identify potential biomarkers 
of efficacy.  
• 
Patient-reported outcome measures should be included in clinical 
trials to provide additional assessment of the impact of treatment. 
Rigorous studies will allow continued progress in the development of 
improved treatments for patients with NENs.
