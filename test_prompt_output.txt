Abstract
The aim of the present guidance paper was to update the previous ENETS
guidelines on well-differentiated gastric and duodenal neuroendocrine tumours
(NETs), providing practical guidance for specialists in the diagnosis and manage-
ment of gastroduodenal NETs. Type II gastric NETs, neuroendocrine carcinomas
(NECs), and functioning duodenal NETs are not covered, since they will be dis-
cussed in other ENETS guidance papers.

GASTRIC NEUROENDOCRINE
TUMOURS

Introduction – general background
Gastric neuroendocrine neoplasms (gNENs) are rare tumours with an
increasing annual incidence of 0.4/100,000, and a prevalence of
3/100,000.1 The vast majority of gNENs are well-differentiated neu-
roendrocrine tumours (NETs), which are usually classified according to
the background gastric pathology into three major categories:
(i) type I when chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is present resulting in
hypergastrinaemia (the most common type, accounting for 75%–
80% of all gNENs); (ii) type II when the tumour occurs due to hyper-
gastrinaemia in the context of Zollinger–Ellison syndrome (ZES) and

multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN-I) syndrome (5% of
gNENs); type III, which are sporadic lesions not associated with
hypergastrinaemia (15%–25% of gNENs). Type I gNETs are indolent,
with negligible risk of metastases (<5%) and excellent long-term sur-
vival (almost 100%); the prognosis of a patient with type II gNETs
needs to be assessed in the context of MEN-I syndrome; however,
the risk of metastases may vary between 10% and 30%. Type III
tumours are usually more aggressive, owing to the high prevalence
of metastatic disease (>50%) and the more unfavourable long-term
survival (5-year survival rate 70%), although they present well-
differentiated morphology in the majority of cases. Type III gNENs
may also have higher grades. The key questions discussed in the pre-
sent paper are summarised in Table 1. Data were identified by MED-
LINE database searches and expert opinion/recommendations given
according to the best available evidence and the authors’ experi-
ence. Each recommendation for treatment and diagnosis will have a
level of evidence and grade of recommendation as per the GRADE
system (Table S1). The major features of gNETs are summarised in
Table 2.

Assessment of gastric neuroendocrine
tumours
1.2.1
|
Pathology
Gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs) are different from other
gastrointestinal NETs as in the stomach a clear aetiology is emerging
where gastric NETs are induced in the context of hyperplasia of
enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. In 1993 an aetiological framework
for gastric NETs was reported,2 where gastric NETs were either
found in a setting of ECL cell hyperplasia associated with high gas-
trin levels due to autoimmune fundic atrophic gastritis (type I NETs),
high gastrin levels due to gastrinoma (type II NETs) or without ECL
hyperplasia (type III NETs). More recently, general atrophy in chronic
H. pylori associated gastritis,3 functional failure of parietal cells due
to mutations4 or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use5 have also been
reported to be associated with NETs, some with a background of
ECL cell hyperplasia but in cases of proton pump inhibition also
associated with parietal cell hyperplasia. These newly described gas-
tric NETs are similar to the originally described type I gNETs as they
are secondary to failed acid secretion. The secondary (type I and
type II) gNETs have a more indolent course2,5 and can be reversible
if the cause can be impeded. It is therefore important to recognise
the associated gastric mucosal changes.6
Adequate tumour sampling is essential for grading NETs as pre-
scribed in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of gas-
trointestinal tumours of 2019.7 As NETs are usually located deep in
the mucosa (not at the surface) attention should be paid to this when
taking biopsies.
Gastric NETs are graded using the same criteria as for all gastroin-
testinal sites:8
G1: mitotic count <2 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index <3% in hotspot
of at least 500 cells.
G2: mitotic count between 2 and 20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index
between 3% and 20% in hotspot of at least 500 cells.
G3: mitotic count >20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20% in hot-
spot of at least 500 cells.
1.2.2
|
Endoscopy
The primary diagnostic tool for gNETs is oesophagogastroduode-
noscopy (OGD). For the assessment of gastric NETs, not only rep-
resentative biopsies of the tumour but also biopsies of the
surrounding mucosa and other parts of the stomach (antrum and
body-fundus) are essential as these give clues on the nature/
aetiology and, with this, the prognosis and treatment of the NET.
In addition, sampling of gastric juice for pH measurement is
strongly encouraged. Furthermore, virtual chromoendoscopy (nar-
row-band imaging, blue light imaging, i-scan) may be useful to pro-
vide
additional
information
to
identify
field
changes
or
precancerous lesions in underlying atrophic mucosa.9 In addition
to OGD, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be performed in all
lesions >1 cm regardless of type and in all lesions of type III
regardless of size, unless large or metastatic lesions are found.
Reporting should include size of the lesion infiltration depth and
assessment of local lymph nodes.
Recommendations
Evaluation of gNETs should always include:
1. Biopsies to evaluate proliferative activity of the tumour (Ki67
and/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).

3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).
1.2.3
|
Imaging and laboratory examinations
Biomarker assessment should include fasting gastrin and chromo-
granin A (CgA). Whereas gastrin may be useful to differentiate
between different types (elevated in type I and type II, normal in
type III), CgA is only useful as a tumour marker in type III gNETs.
In the presence of ongoing PPI therapy gastrin and CgA are not
diagnostic and are difficult to interpret. In general, caution should
be used when evaluating CgA values, considering the different
diagnostic accuracy of available assays. Parietal cell and intrinsic
factor antibodies, vitamin B12 and thyroid function parameters
should be measured in suspected cases of autoimmune gastritis.
Whereas type I gNETs do not usually require additional cross-
sectional imaging, type III gNETs should undergo cross-sectional
imaging – liver contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and/or contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography
(CT), with previous ingestion of water immediately before examina-
tion, to fill stomach and duodenum and better depict small enhancing
lesion in the arterial phase, and functional imaging, preferentially
somatostatin receptor PET/CT (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT).
These should also be considered in cases of type I gNETs with
metastases on EUS or high-risk features of metastases (G2, lymphatic
or vascular invasion, size ≥1 cm). Recently, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT has
been suggested in selected cases with tumour diameter >1 cm, G2
tumours (perhaps Ki-67 > 10 but exact cutoff not determined), or R1
margins after endoscopic resection.10
Prognosis depends on type, size, grading, histological risk factors
(e.g., lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion), completeness of
resection and initial tumour stage.
Recommendations
1. Gastrin assessment is useful to differentiate between different
types of gNETs. CgA is useful as tumour marker only in type III
gNETs (3b-A).
2. Cross-sectional radiological imaging (CT/MRI) and 68Ga-SSA-PET-
CT are not required in type I gNETs, unless metastases on EUS or
in the presence of high-risk features (G2, vessel invasion, sus-
pected T2 on EUS ) (3b–A).

Management strategy for type I gNETs
1.3.1
|
Introduction
Treatment options for type I gNETs include surveillance, endoscopic
resection, somatostatin analogues (SSA) and eventually surgery. As
prognosis is usually quite favourable and tumour growth slow and risk
of metastases is below 1% in tumours <10 mm, all NET <1 cm can be
observed without any need for intervention.11,12 The ideal schedule
for observational OGD is not defined and clinical practice ranges from
every 6 months to every 2 years. Planning the first follow-up after
6 months and then every 12 months is the most widely used
approach. A regular rebiopsy of lesions is not necessary unless atypi-
cal features (e.g., ulceration, erosion, pitting) appear, suggesting inva-
sive progression of the lesion. The management of type I gNETs is
summarised in Figure 1.
1.3.2
|
Q1 – What is the role of endoscopic
resection for type I gNETs? Is additional treatment
required in cases of R1 endoscopic resection?
Endoscopic resection should be considered for type I gNETs larger
than 1 cm and for those lesions demonstrating increased Ki-67 as
these features are associated with an increased risk of metastases and
progression.11,13 Many small type I gNETs are G1 or low G2
(Ki-67 < 10%);14 however, a Ki-67 cutoff has not been defined to
determined when excision should be performed. Endoscopic ultraso-
nography to determine depth of local invasion and assessment of local
lymph nodes should be performed in lesions >1 cm and in smaller
tumours with “high” G2 grade (cutoff not established) before any
resection. No other imaging modality is required at this stage. The re-
section technique of choice depends on size and position of the
lesion, invasion depth and local experience. Endoscopic mucosal re-
section (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and full-
thickness resection (FTR) are all associated with a low risk profile for
both bleeding and perforation. It is not clear which is the best endo-
scopic technique to be used for achieving a complete R0 resection.15
However, resection by ESD or FTR achieve higher rates of R0 resec-
tion, but no randomised trials have compared all techniques head-to-
head.16,17 For R1 resection status a re-resection in a “step-up”
approach could be recommended (e.g., ESD after EMR, FTR after
ESD), although data showing risk of local recurrence after R1

resection are scarce,18 particularly for smaller tumours which may be
managed by a non-interventional endoscopic surveillance after initial
R1 resection.19
Conclusion/recommendations
1. Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger
than 1 cm (2b-A).
2. ESD and FTR are more effective to achieve R0 resection compared
to EMR (2b-B).
3. In case of incomplete resection (R1) of a NET >1 cm a step-up
approach (EMR > ESD > FTR > surgery) is recommended (4-C).
1.3.3

Q2 – When should somatostatin analogues
be used to treat type I gNETs?
Type I gNETs usually express somatostatin receptors. Thus, therapy
with SSA can be initiated in metastasised patients or patients not
amenable to endoscopic or surgical resection (e.g., difficult location,
old age, comorbidities). SSA therapy is associated with a high com-
plete response rate of 25%–100%, but relapse is frequently observed
after discontinuation of therapy.20 Thus, continuous therapy would be
the appropriate approach. Another reason for starting SSA therapy
could be large tumour size or the requirement of repeated endoscopic
resection for progressive lesions, although data evaluating this
approach are lacking. Another therapeutic approach could be direct
inhibition of gastrin signalling in tumour cells. Indeed, the gastrin
receptor
inhibitor
netazepide
has
been
evaluated
in
a
proof-
of-concept phase II trial with 16 patients showing a complete
response rate in 30% of patients.21 Like SSA treatment, tumour
relapse after discontinuation was observed in all patients. The clinical
benefit of netazepide needs to be evaluated in larger randomised clini-
cal trials before any recommendation for its use can be formulated.
Recommendations
1. In type I gNET patients when tumour resection is indicated but
endoscopic or surgical techniques are not possible, SSA therapy is
appropriate (2b-A).
1.3.4
|
Q3 – What is the recommended follow-up
schedule in type I gNETs?
An endoscopic follow-up every 12 months is recommended after
complete endoscopic resection of a type I gNET. Whether this interval
can be increased after prolonged periods without evidence of relapse
or whether the interval should be shortened in case of incomplete
(R1) resection or risk factors associated with progression (grading G2,
size >20 mm) should be carefully discussed with the patient. In gen-
eral, no cross-sectional imaging is required for follow-up. In addition,
repeated evaluation of biomarkers CgA and gastrin should not be per-
formed as these markers are elevated due to the underlying CAG and
are not an indicator of relapse or progression. Follow-up OGD is
recommended in a type I gNET that does not require resection,
although the optimal interval for planning endoscopy is not estab-
lished
(1–2 years
can
be
considered,
following
first
follow-up
6–12 months after initial diagnosis). Apart from risk of tumour pro-
gression or relapse after resection in NET lesions, patients with CAG

carry a relevant risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma. Although
only one international guideline recommends a regular endoscopic
follow-up for patients with CAG, the yearly rate of adenocarcinoma
detection is up to 1% in patients with type I gNETs.14 Whether this
reflects an increased risk of adenocarcinoma development in patients
with a previous diagnosis of gNET is not clear. For CAG patients with-
out a gNET, intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection have been
linked to an increased risk of adenocarcinoma progression. Given the
high risk of adenocarcinoma detection upon follow-up of gNETs, this
supports the recommendation to perform an endoscopic follow-up
every 12–24 months in patients with previously diagnosed gNETs
(specific timing may be proposed according to tumour size and histo-
logical features), whereas a 3-year interval is recommended in CAG
patients without gNETs.22
Recommendations
1. An endoscopic follow-up by OGD is recommended 12 months
after complete endoscopic resection of type I gNET (2b-B).
2. In
those
not
requiring
resection
first
follow-up
should
be
12 months and then consider annual to every 1–2 years (2b-B).
3. In patients with type I gNET, endoscopic follow-up by OGD is
recommended also given the risk of developing gastric adenocarci-
noma related to CAG (2b-A).
1.3.5
|
Q4 – When is surgery recommended for
type I gNETs?
Although type I gNETs are usually treated by an endoscopic approach,
upfront surgical resection is recommended in all tumours that are
greater than 20 mm in size or with suspected muscolaris propria inva-
sion (either on axial imaging or EUS). In addition, surgery could be
considered in tumours showing high risk features on biopsy (e.g., high
grade 2 NET [cutoff not established], lymphovascular invasion). A lim-
ited resection with sampling of local lymph nodes is the preferred
approach. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy should be
discussed in patients with known lymph node metastases or might be
proposed as a completion procedure after final histology has proven
lymphatic spread, although there are no solid data supporting this
option.
Endoscopic resection should not be attempted in the presence of
invasion into the muscularis propria, suspected lymph node metasta-
ses or high-risk features of metastatic spread (e.g., high Ki-67, vascular
invasion, size >20 mm). These patients should receive full staging
including cross-sectional imaging as described previously and 68Ga-
SSA-PET-CT and upfront surgical management. The optimal cutoff
value for Ki-67 is not determined, but Ki-67 values above 10% should
trigger evaluation of surgical treatment. In the rare instance of a G3
type I gNET a primarily surgical approach is recommended due to high
risk of metastases.23 Regarding tumour size, no clear cutoff for surgi-
cal management can be defined. Only limited data exist on tumour
size and risk of metastases in the subgroup of type I gNETs. Data from
the SEER database and from a large series from Taiwan showed that a
cutoff of 20 mm was associated with an increased risk of lymph node
metastases.13,24
In case of incomplete endoscopic resection (R1) or risk features in
final pathology after endoscopic resection, a surgical approach should
be discussed with the patient to achieve R0 resection and/or re-
section of local lymph nodes to exclude metastatic spread. In cases of
lesions not amenable to an endoscopic approach (e.g., location close
to cardia) a primary surgical resection might be necessary.
SSA treatment to reduce gastrin production, thus diminishing the
stimulus for further tumour growth and progression, could be pro-
posed in patients who could not undergo resection or for multiple
larger tumours or frequent relapse. Antrectomy should no longer be
routinely offered but might be an option in patients not tolerating
SSA or declining continuous application.
Recommendations
1. Surgical approach is recommended in tumours >20 mm or with
suspected muscolaris propria invasion (either on axial imaging or
EUS). In addition, surgery could be considered (in tumours show-
ing high risk features on biopsies (high Ki-67, lymphovascular inva-
sion) (2b-A).
2. Limited resection with local nodal sampling is the preferred surgical
strategy (3b-A).
3. Gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy (specific kind of re-
section according with the tumour site) should be discussed in
patients with known lymph node metastases or might be proposed
as a completion procedure after final histology has proven lym-
phatic spread after full exploration with cross sectional imaging
(3b-A).

Type II gNETs

the context of hypergastrinaemia associated with ZES which may

Management strategy for type III gNETS

Background
Type III gNETs have been traditionally regarded as highly aggressive
tumours requiring extended surgical resections (i.e., partial or total
gastrectomy) with lymphadenectomy. However, with the widespread
use of high-definition endoscopy, type III gNETs of smaller size and
lower grade are increasingly being detected. A recent systematic
review of 147 type III gNENs in which tumour management was
reported found that 45% were G1, 35% were G2 and 20% were
G3.26 As a result, less invasive treatment options, ranging from endo-
scopic resection to surgical wedge resection, have been investigated

in highly selected patients. The management of type III gNETs is sum-
marised in Figure 2.
1.5.2
|
Q5 – Can endoscopic treatments be
proposed to treat type III gNETs?
Type III gNETs should be carefully characterised using endoscopy,
biopsy, cross sectional thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI, and often
functional imaging (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT or FDG/PET-CT depending on
tumour grade) and in most cases EUS. Evidence from several retro-
spective
case
series
suggests
that
carefully
selected
patients
who have no evidence of lymph node involvement can be safely and
successfully
managed
by
endoscopic
resection.
Endoscopic
re-
section appears to be most appropriate in patients who have localised
G1 tumours ≤10 mm in diameter, because tumours greater than this
size are more likely to have lymph node metastases (even though
these may not be detected by imaging techniques).26,27 However
endoscopic resection can also be considered in patients with slightly
larger tumours (<15 mm) and low G2 (Ki-67 3–10%) histology, partic-
ularly if the risks of surgical resection are considered to be high.26
Current evidence does not support the use of a particular endoscopic
resection technique (EMR vs. ESD).26 Some very small (<5 mm)
tumours have also been unintentionally removed by avulsion biopsy
with no evidence of subsequent tumour recurrence, but this approach
is
not
generally
recommended.26
Patients
with
positive
re-
section margins (R1) should be considered for additional endoscopic
resection or surgical salvage if appropriate. Patients who have under-
gone endoscopic resection should have close follow up with endos-
copy and imaging (thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI) to detect local
and distant tumour recurrence.
Recommendations
1. Endoscopic resection may be considered in patients who have
localised type III G1 gNETs ≤10 mm, and occasionally larger
tumours with Ki-67 <10% and <15 mm in diameter if the risks of
surgical
resection
are
high
provided
adequate
staging
is
allowed (3a–C).
1.5.3

Q6 – When should limited or extended
surgical treatments be proposed to treat type III
gNETs?
Several clinicopathological features should be carefully evaluated to
identify the best surgical option (limited vs. extended resection) for
patients with type III gNETs.
A limited gastric wedge resection without standard lymphade-
nectomy can be considered as treatment option in patients with loca-
lised, G1 type III gNETs with no evidence of lymph node involvement
on preoperative imaging (including EUS).26 In patients fulfilling the
above-mentioned criteria, tumour size, depth of infiltration and pres-
ence of lymphovascular invasion should be further assessed to define
the extent of surgical resection. Therefore, a wedge resection can be
safely proposed to patients with G1 type III gNETs <20 mm, limited to
the submucosal layer and with no evidence of lymphovascular inva-
sion.26,28 The role of wedge resections in patients with G2 type III gNETs
remains debated, as tumour grade represents a powerful predictor of dis-
ease aggressiveness. Similarly, the tumour size cutoff for proposing lim-
ited surgical resection is not clearly defined. Type III gNETs <10 mm are
usually managed with endoscopic resection, whereas a limited surgical re-
section might be considered as initial treatment option for lesions measur-
ing >10 mm and <20 mm.26 Recent experiences report favourable

oncological outcomes after endoscopic resection/limited surgical resec-
tion, thus strengthening the notion that a conservative approach might be
appropriate for highly selected patients with type III gNETs.27,29 In the
presence of positive margins (R1) after endoscopic resection, salvage sur-
gical wedge resection represents a possible treatment strategy.
Radical surgical resection, either total or subtotal gastrectomy, with
lymphadenectomy represents the procedure of choice for all the patients
diagnosed with type III gNETs showing at least one of the following fea-
tures: (1) nodal or distant metastases on preoperative imaging, (2) Ki-67
proliferative index defining a G3 tumour (Ki-67 >20%), and (3) tumour
size >20 mm. Radical surgery is recommended as second-line treatment
when final histology reveals one or more of the following findings: pres-
ence of nodal metastases, higher tumour grade compared with original
biopsy, lymphovascular invasion or lack of complete tumour clearance
(R1), in patients initially managed with a limited wedge resection.26
Recommendations
1. A limited wedge resection with local nodal sampling (without standard
lymphadenectomy) can be considered as a treatment option in patients
with localised, G1–G2 type III gNETs, with no evidence of lymphade-
nopathy on full staging preoperative imaging (including EUS) (2b-B).
2. Radical surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is recommended in
type III gNETs when nodal metastases are found/suspected on preop-
erative staging, if Ki67 >20% or tumour diameter >20 mm (2b-B).
1.5.4
|
Q7 – What scheduled follow-up is
recommended after endoscopic/surgical resection of
type III gNETs?
Follow-up of patients who underwent surgical resection of type III
gNETs is based on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging (thora-
coabdominal CT/liver-MRI with sometimes OGD and/or EUS or func-
tional imaging [68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and/or FDG-PET/CT depending on
the tumour grade]). The timing of follow-up has never been clearly
defined. When a total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is per-
formed, the follow-up schedule adopted for gastric adenocarcinoma
should be applied.26 On the other hand, patients managed conserva-
tively (endoscopic or surgical local excision) should undergo OGD
after about 3 months to check the resection site and if this shows no
macroscopic residual tumour, they should have regular follow-up with
cross-sectional imaging and endoscopy/EUS. The frequency and
choice of test will be influenced by the final tumour size and grade as
well as patient fitness and in most cases, it will be possible to reduce
the frequency of follow up as time progresses after resection. 68Ga-
SSA-PET-CT (or FDG-PET/CT depending on the tumour grade) and
biopsies should be performed in the presence of a suspected disease
relapse, but they are not routinely part of the follow-up programme.30
Recommendations
1. Radiological follow-up by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recom-
mended in patients treated by surgical resection for type III gNETs (5-A).

DUODENAL NEUROENDOCRINE
TUMOURS
2.1

Introduction – general background
Like gNETs, duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs) are rare
tumours but also with an increasing incidence found mostly at OGD
or axial imaging for other reasons (incidental discovery) but also can
be found as primaries at workup for patients with stage 4 diseases or
more rarely as part of inherited syndromes such as MEN-I and neuro-
fibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Most dNETs are non-functional tumours,
but duodenal tumours secreting gastrin are not infrequent (either spo-
radic or as part of MEN-I) and more rarely tumours secreting somato-
statin (so called somatostatinomas) (see Guidance paper on functional
pancreatic NETs).
The overall incidence of dNETs is low accounting for only 2.8% of
all NETs.31,32 The annual age adjusted incidence for dNET has been
reported to be 0.19 per 100,000.32 Traditionally, dNETs have been
classified into non-functioning (approximately 90% of lesions) or func-
tioning tumours (those secreting specific peptides of hormones elicit-
ing a functional clinical consequence or syndrome)33 and can be
summarised as:
1. Non-functioning dNETs (they can secrete peptides and substances
not resulting in a clinical condition or syndrome).
2. Duodenal composite gangliocytoma/neuroma and neuroendocrine
tumour (CogNET) (previously known as gangliocytic paragan-
glioma), occurs almost exclusively in the second part of the duode-
num and periampullary region and is considered a composite
tumour of epithelial NETs and ganglioneuroma.34
3. Duodenal gastrinoma (gastrin secreting and either sporadic or part
of MEN-I where duodenal localisation is very frequent) and soma-
tostatinomas (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance
paper on functioning pancreatic NETs).
4. Duodenal NEC (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance
paper for digestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).

Assessment of dNETs
2.2.1
|
Pathology
Pathological assessment and grading of dNETs is like that of NETs of
all other sites. Adequate sampling is needed and the deep mucosal
location of these lesions, usually suspected by the endoscopist due to
the smooth surface as opposed to the more common adenomas and
carcinomas of the duodenum, warrants an attempt to perform deep
biopsies. Morphologically, the main differential diagnosis in the duo-
denum is the CoGNET, previously classified as a ganglioneuroma or
paraganglioma, but now shown to be more similar to NETs.36,37
In cases with a high proliferation rate (i.e., mitotic count >20 in
2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20%), NEC and adenocarcinoma with

neuroendocrine features should be ruled out (see guidance paper for
digestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).
2.2.2
|
Endoscopy
Most dNETs are in the first or second part of the duodenum.38 Symp-
toms range from mostly none at incidental discovery to symptoms
attributed to gastric outlet obstruction (in rare cases of large lesions)
or anaemia. Patients with dNETs close to the ampulla and CoGNET
which occur in the periampullary region can present with gastrointes-
tinal bleeding, abdominal pain, anaemia or jaundice.38,39 Periampullary
dNETs are not infrequent in patients with neurofibromatosis type
1 (NF1), also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease including
somatostatinomas.40,41
At OGD, dNETs have similar features to gNETs but are typically
single small sessile, erythematous or pale lesions in the duodenal cap,
bulb or D1 to D2.6 In recent years, increasingly smaller lesions have
been detected, owing to the better mucosal visualisation with modern
endoscopic tools. The reported mean size of dNETs varies between
7 mm and 1.5 cm.42 Up to 10% of dNETs can occur as multiple
tumours, which should prompt a diagnosis of MEN-I. It has been
reported that approximately a quarter to a third of patients with
dNETs and ZES, have undiagnosed MEN-I.43,44
Endoscopic characterisation of dNETs has been described by Bor-
bath and colleagues.6 Diagnosis is usually confirmed at endoscopic
forceps biopsy (care as very small lesions may be almost completely
excised at biopsy sampling and making future identification hard in
case of R1 resection). Tumours of 1 cm or above should have accurate
local staging by EUS as regional lymph node metastases occur in up to
40%–60% of cases, especially in duodenal gastrinomas.43,45,46
Recommendations
Evaluation of dNETs should always include:
1. Biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate proliferative activ-
ity of the tumour (Ki-67 and/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).
2. Endoscopic assessment of dNETs should include tumour location
to identify periampullary tumours (2b-A).
3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).
2.2.3
|
Imaging and laboratory examinations
Duodenal NETs are generally diagnosed by endoscopy and endoscopic
ultrasound. Computed tomography after ingestion of water to fill stom-
ach and duodenum, is recommended to help preoperative exploration.
CT-enterography, MRI, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and 18F-DOPA-PET/CT are
not sufficiently accurate for localisation of well-differentiated gastrodu-
odenal primary tumours,47–49 but these examinations are used to help
staging of regional and distant metastases.50
Laboratory tests are required for patients newly diagnosed with
dNET. It is especially important to recognise potential gastrinoma
(serum gastrin, chromogranin and occasionally secretin testing). Other
laboratory tests, if symptoms are suggestive, may include somato-
statin, and very rarely growth hormone releasing factor and cortisol
with urinary 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid.38 If a diagnosis of genetic syn-
drome is suspected (e.g., MEN-I or NF1) specific laboratory tests and
germline testing is advised38,51 Distinguishing between dNET and
neurofibromas may be difficult in some cases especially on axial
imaging.
Recommendations
1. Locoregional and distant staging examiner actions for dNETs
include contrast-enhanced CT (with water ingestion), liver -MRI
and 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT (3b-B).
2. Ruling out gastrinoma and screening for genetic syndromes when
appropriate should be considered for dNETs (3b-B).
2.3
|
Management strategy for dNETs
Factors that need to be considered prior to endoscopic resection of
dNET are:
1. Size of tumour (commonly estimated at EUS and OGD).
2. Depth of invasion in relation to the deep muscle layer (estimated
at EUS).
3. Any evidence of lymphadenopathy and/or metastatic spread on
EUS, liver-MRI, thoracoabdominal CT and functional imaging, pref-
erably 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.
4. Grade and morphology of tumour (determined by endoscopy, EUS
and endoscopic biopsy).
5. Endoscopic
appearance:
central
depression/ulceration
implies
invasion.
6. Suitability for endoscopic resection: size of lesion/endoscopic
access/location of lesion/proximity to ampulla.
7. Hormone secretion status.
8. Patient age and performance status.
Size of the lesion is not a definitive guide to the correct treat-
ment. Treatment options are: endoscopic surveillance, endoscopic re-
section (by EMR/ESD/underwater EMR/over the scope clip), local
duodenal resection (LR) or pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). The out-
comes may be related to the factors of the tumour at presentation
rather than the type of resection procedure.52 The management of
dNETs is summarised in Figure 3.
When defining surgical indications for dNET, several key points
should be considered (see section 8.3).
2.3.1
|
Q8 – When is endoscopic
resection indicated?
Very small non-functioning lesions 5 mm or less in D1 are commonly
removed after lifting injection and snare (or by diagnostic biopsy)
before any histological diagnosis is made and these lesions do not
usually recur or metastasise.

---
For younger and fitter patients who have lesions of 5–10 mm
(and up to 15 mm in some centres), an opinion should be sought
from therapeutic endoscopy about resection and the associated
risks. EUS should be performed as well as axial and functional imag-
ing. Most of these lesions are grade 1 and not invading the muscle
layer.
In
these
circumstances
an
endoscopic
resection
using
EMR/Cap EMR/ESD is reasonable, but risks of perforation are signif-
icant, especially in D2. If endoscopic therapy is high risk (published
rates of perforation 15%–25%) or unlikely to be curative, LR
(i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision or enucleation) or pancrea-
toduodenectomy (PD) (if considered essential by the surgeon) should
be considered. Endoscopic therapy combined with laparoscopy for
rescue in the event of perforation has been performed which may
represent a novel and valuable alternative to ESD, able to guarantee
a
high
R0
rate
and
a
low
risk
of
intraoperative
duodenal
perforation.53
Duodenal NETs can be multiple, particularly if they are gas-
trinomas, and an association with MEN-I exists. Somatostatino-
mas
can
also
occur
in
the
duodenum,
often
close
to
the
ampulla, but generally are without a clinical syndrome. There is
an
association
with
NF1
(functioning
tumours
are
being
addressed in a separate guidance paper on pancreatic func-
tional NETs).
Recommendations
1. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 should be removed
using EMR type techniques (3b-C).
2. Lesions of 5–10 mm (and up to 15 mm in some centres) can be
removed endoscopically after imaging work-up, but risks are rela-
tively high (3b-C).
2.3.2
|
Q9 – Can a “watch and wait” strategy be
proposed in dNETs?
A watch and wait policy could be considered for very small (<5 mm)
dNETs that cannot easily be resected, are non-functional, G1 and not
invading the muscularis propria. This policy has usually been applied in
patients unfit for endoscopic resection or surgery, since a more defini-
tive therapy would be recommended in most cases, although a watch
and wait policy has more recently been recommended as a result from
some small series with limited follow-up. It is not clear if watch and
wait is a suitable option in a patient who is fit for resection.54,55
Recommendations
There is very limited evidence for a watch and wait policy and generally
this is applied to those unfit for surgery or endoscopic resection (3b-C).
2.3.3
|
Q10 – When is surgery indicated?
Data on nodal risk in very small non-functioning dNETs are scarce.
Some series report nodal metastases as a common finding in patients
with dNET (40%–60%), with tumour size being the most relevant risk

factor for nodal involvement.56 In cases with a tumour diameter >1 cm,
nodal metastases were found in 13 out of 18 cases. Tumour location
may be another important feature to be considered when defining sur-
gical indication. Lesions arising in the ampullary/periampullary area dif-
fer from other dNETs due to a more aggressive biological behaviour in
some studies57 but not in others.56 Functioning neoplasms harbour a
higher metastatic potential.58 Tumour invasion beyond the submucosa,
tumour grade G2–G3 and lymphovascular invasion are factors affecting
the risk of nodal metastases.
Despite very low grade evidence surgical resection may be indi-
cated in patients with dNETs showing any of the following features:
1. Tumour size >10 mm; (some centres may advocate endoscopic
removal in 10–15 mm).
2. Tumour extending beyond the submucosa.
3. Tumour grade G2–G3.
4. Lymphovascular invasion.
5. Functioning neoplasms.
Regarding the extent of resection, PD (pancreatoduodenectomy)
and LR (local resection) represent the two main alternatives:
In general, pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy is the
procedure of choice for ampullary/periampullary neoplasms, due to
their particular aggressiveness. When nodal metastases are pre- or
intraoperatively identified, PD with nodal dissection is indicated in order
to obtain a proper oncological clearance. However, for lesions <20 mm,
less aggressive approaches (i.e., local excision with lymphadenectomy or
pancreas-sparing total duodenectomy) may be considered options. At
least eight lymph nodes should be harvested to stage patients accu-
rately.59 However, radical surgery is associated with a high rate of
short- and long-term complications. Therefore, when feasible from an
oncological perspective, other surgical strategies should be considered.
Local duodenal resection (i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision
or enucleation) represents a valuable and safe option, especially for
patients with non-ampullary, non-functioning, dNET and without sus-
pected nodal involvement at staging,52 (where endoscopic resection is
not possible). The role of nodal dissection in this setting is unclear as
recent experience does not support the clearance of occult nodal
metastases due to lack of association with survival advantages.60
Recommendations. 1. Surgery is recommended in cases of size >10–
15 mm and/or tumour extending beyond the
submucosa and/or grade G2-G3 and/or lym-
phovascular invasion (3-B).

MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR
GASTRIC AND DUODENAL G2–G3
METASTATIC NETS
3.1
|
Treatment with curative intent
Due to the lack of effective systemic therapeutic options surgery
should be evaluated even in the presence of metastatic condition
depending on the tumour spread and tumour biology if a complete
tumour resection seems to be possible (R0-resection).
Gastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy includes the removal of
locoregional lymph nodes, so the presence of locoregional lymph
node metastases should not preclude surgery as a treatment option.
In dNET a transduodenal tumour excision with lymph node sampling
or pancreatoduodenectomy are the treatments of choice.30 The com-
plete resection of single or multiple liver metastases might be benefi-
cial even for G3 tumours.61 Thus, surgical resection should be
evaluated in G2 and in very selected cases of G3-NET depending on
the general health condition of the patient. Single or multiple metas-
tases in other locations should be evaluated for a complete
resection.
3.2
|
Widespread metastatic disease
In the presence of metastases, a systemic therapeutic approach is
similar to that recommended for advanced/unresectable NET from
other primary sites, owing to the lack of available data in homoge-
neous series of gastric or duodenal NETs. Somatostatin analogues
are indicated for NETs G1–G2 with low Ki67 (<10%), and positive
somatostatin receptors but can be administered in tumours with
higher Ki-67 if slow tumour growth or slow progression are seen.
Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid option
depending on the receptor status of the tumour. Molecular-
targeted therapy with everolimus is a therapeutic option, but with
limited
evidence.62
In
NET
G3
chemotherapy
should
be
administered.63
3.3
|
Palliative primary tumour resection
In cases of unresectable distant metastases a palliative primary
tumour resection can be considered rarely to avoid local complica-
tions. The kind and extent of surgery has to be evaluated depending
on the location of the tumour and possibility of complications of sur-
gery. A gastrectomy can be necessary in rare cases but a wedge resec-
tion, distal or subtotal gastric resection should be preferred to reduce
perioperative
morbidity.
A
gastric
bypass
without
tumour
re-
section should be favoured in case of bulky disease with infiltration of
the visceral arteries or pancreas.
3.4
|
Local recurrence
In the presence of local recurrence without diffuse metastatic spread,
operative resection should be favoured to avoid bleeding or intestinal
obstruction and to maintain quality of life. Even in the presence of dis-
tant metastatic spread palliative surgery should be considered to
ensure quality of life depending on the tumour biology and the gen-
eral health status of the patient. Endoscopic procedures such as stent
or jejunal catheterisation are alternatives for patients with a poor gen-
eral health status.

3.5
|
Follow-up
The interval for follow-up by contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT
and/or liver-MRI, 3–12 months, should be based on the malignant
potential of the tumour.64 Follow-up by additional 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT
is helpful when the patient's clinical status and the results of CT or
MRI and biochemistry are discordant. The sensitivity of 68Ga-SSA-
PET-CT is superior to contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT for
characterisation and detection of lymph node metastases and for visu-
alisation of metastases to bone and liver,65 and therefore provides
earlier detection of new lesions. FDG-PET/CT is instead used in G3
tumours and can also be helpful in high G2 NET when 68Ga-SSA-PET-
CT is negative. Re-evaluation of untreated patients should be per-
formed at 3–6 month intervals.
Recommendations
1. Surgery with curative intention of metastatic gastroduodenal NET
G1/G2/G3 should be performed, if a complete tumour (including
metastases) resection seems feasible (4-B).
2. Palliative surgery (primary resection, bypass) may be indicated in
metastatic disease to maintain quality of life (4-C).
3. The choice of systemic therapy for metastatic gastroduodenal NET
depends on tumour grading and includes biotherapy, everolimus,
PRRT and chemotherapy (4-B).

CONCLUSIONS
4.1
|
Gastric NETs
1. Evaluation of the type of gNETs by assessing separate biopsies
from the antral and fundic mucosa is needed.
2. Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger
than 1 cm, whereas a surgical approach should be proposed in
tumours larger than 2 cm. Tumours between 1 cm and 2 cm in size
are usually managed by endoscopic resection after EUS evaluation,
although surgery might be indicated in selected cases with G2
tumours and high Ki-67 (cutoff not established), and in G3
tumours.
3. In type III gNETs, a surgical approach is recommended. However,
in selected patients with small (<1 cm) G1 tumours, endoscopic re-
section may be appropriate.
4.2
|
Duodenal NETs
1. Endoscopic assessment should include tumour location to identify
periampullary tumours. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm.
2. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 may be removed using
EMR type techniques, whereas larger tumours (>1 cm) and/or
tumour extending beyond the submucosa and/or grades G2–G3
and/or lymphovascular invasion and/or functioning neoplasms
should be managed by a surgical approach after complete disease
staging by dedicated CT, liver-MRI+/ 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.
4.3
|
Unmet needs
1. The prognostic role of Ki67 in type I gNETs is unclear.
2. Long-term outcomes of endoscopic resection for both selected
gastric type 3 NETs, and also duodenal NETs, are lacking.
3. The risk of progression in low-grade gastroduodenal NETs after
incomplete R1 endoscopic resection is unknown.
4. The role of somatostatin analogue treatments in managing type I
gNETs has not yet been established.
5. More data are required regarding natural history PPI-induced
gNETs.

INTRODUCTION
Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) arise from the diffuse
neuroendocrine cell system and may occur at many
different disease sites. Most frequently, these neoplasms
occur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The
term NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine
tumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine
carcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all
NENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic
small intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)
since these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced
disease stages. In general, the management of other
gastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or
Pan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs
such as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)
expression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.
Recommendation
 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be
based on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-
ity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of
the disease [IV, A].
INCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY
Gastroenteropancreatic
NENs
(GEP-NENs)
constitute
a
heterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal
phenotype and the capacity to secrete amines
and
hormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells
of the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has
increased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The
incidence of localised and regional NENs has increased
more than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The
incidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the
USA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology
and End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/
100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has
recently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of
individual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at
Annals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of
GEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e
2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the
national and regional registries and are heterogeneous and
mostly retrospective.2e4
Men are affected slightly more frequently than women
and show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-
differentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of
the pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of
the thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.
Pancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von
Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and
neuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are
multifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades
earlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are
often early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of
a hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was
reported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing
revealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried
germline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.
MUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6

Recommendations
 While most NENs are sporadic, a hereditary background
should be considered, particularly in Pan-NETs.
 Genetic testing should be carried out in patients with
multiple
endocrine
neoplasias
(hyperparathyroidism
and/or pituitary tumours), a family history of NENs or
associated diseases and features suspicious of a heredi-
tary disease, as well as in young patients (<40 years of
age) with gastrinoma [IV, A].
DIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
Histological diagnosis is mandatory in all patients and can
be carried out on resection specimens or core biopsies in
advanced disease. The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on
hematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-
logical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine
phenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-
tion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or
chromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is
very exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,
but in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully
excluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers
are often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended
due to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be
classiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,
rarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1
to G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).
These two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-
cally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-
ation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences
between the two classes. Therefore, the World Health
Organization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the
heterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET
G3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,
histomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation
in Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in
separating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of
well-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid
exclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for
gastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-
ﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones
such as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)
can be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-
tomatology, but there is no complete agreement between
immunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there
can be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion
[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].
IHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs
according to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both
the number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67
index based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported
(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these
two methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other
biomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in
case functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and
p53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3
(Table
2).8
For
appropriate
pathological
diagnosis,
morphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for
CgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].
NETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive
system represent tumour entities that differ in their biology
and clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may
secrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF
to functional status.10
Recommendation
 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,
grading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and
synaptophysin should be reported. SSTR staining or spe-
ciﬁc staining for peptide hormones and amines as well as
use of molecular markers is optional and dependent on
clinical requirements [III, A].
STAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT
Disease stage and tumour grade are the two major indepen-
dent prognostic parameters and should always be assessed
[III, A]. Since the WHO 2010 classiﬁcation, NENs are graded

according to Ki-67 index and mitotic count (Table 1). For
staging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-
tem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-
ciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth
edition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-
ican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11
for various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system
of adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the
primary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in
advanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs
have a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-
testinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,
available at Annals of Oncology online).
Computed
tomography
(CT)
constitutes
the
basic
radiological method for NET imaging because of its wide
availability, standardised reproducible technique and generally
high diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)
mayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity
is poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases
may be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect
NETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The
detection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e
94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the
sensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range
87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-
tageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is
usually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative
imaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,
diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the
restricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as
in tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-
tion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e
100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e
95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e
80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean
sensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e
98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%
(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging
of the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung
metastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it
offers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-
sound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-
sions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy
monitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT
should be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the
current optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs
with 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range
86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne
needle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle
for histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound
(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas
and liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in
MEN1 syndrome patients.
Imaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)
positron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT
(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of
NET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-
operative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy
(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is
considerably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-
sectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)
together with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a
higher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal
lesions as well as unknown primary tumours.
The sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-
PET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range
83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and
duodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the
corresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%
and 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-
glucose (FDG) is optional in NENs. FDG is the tracer of choice
for G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose
metabolism and less SSTR expression than the low-grade
NETs, for which the situation is usually the reverse.29 Com-
bined SSTR imaging and FDG-PET-CT has been shown to be
complementary for lesion detection. Findings of FDG-
positive NETs at PET-CT indicate worse prognosis.29e31
The author panel believes that optimal diagnostic and
prognostic information can be achieved by submitting all
NET G2/G3 patients to PET-CT with both FDG and 68Ga-

DOTA-SSA (DOTATOC/DOTATATE/DOTANOC); however, this
procedure needs validation and cannot be generally re-
commended, but should rather be adopted on an individual
basis,
balancing
the
potential
advantages
with
the
increasing costs [IV, C].
Recommendations
 Disease stage by TNM classiﬁcation and tumour grade
are the two major independent prognostic parameters
and should always be assessed [III, A].
 Whole-body SSTR imaging should be part of the tumour
staging, preoperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].
B 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT is recommended but, if not
available, SRS can be used, although it is considerably
less sensitive [IV, B].
B SRS should include cross-sectional imaging by SPECT.
 MRI should be preferred compared with CT for the
detection of liver, pancreas, brain and bone lesions,
while CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs [III, A].
 The use of FDG-PET is optional in NENs and should be
adopted on an individual basis, balancing the potential
advantages with the costs [IV, C].
MANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE
Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locoregional
disease in NET G1 and G2. In functional NETs, clinical
symptoms should be managed before any intervention
[IV, A].
Pan-NETs
Preoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take
into account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc
symptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and
signs of local invasiveness (Figure 1).
Several studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-
wait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-
NETs 2 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up
and the absence of prospective studies still suggest a
cautious attitude towards this approach.
Currently, a conservative management of incidentally
discovered Pan-NETs 2 cm, consisting of a yearly high-
quality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the
presence of important comorbidities and when a deep
localisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a
pancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-
mended for young patients and in cases when signs of local
invasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/
or presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-
ment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard
pancreatectomy
with
lymphadenectomy
is
mandatory,
whereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation
or central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered
when the indication for surgery is related to long life
expectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-
ence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.
Curative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally
associated with an improved long-term survival and a low
risk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-
creatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with

regional lymphadenectomy35 is recommended for Pan-NETs
>2 cm [IV, A]. Enucleation may represent an alternative
approach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36
Functioning Pan-NETs 2 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent
ideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely
distant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-
ation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected
patients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait
management is contraindicated.
Surgery may also play a role in the presence of
borderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy
with vascular resection is associated with improved out-
comes and it should be carefully considered in the
presence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-
vasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large
tumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should
discourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite
the lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk
features, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.
The role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still
controversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear
beneﬁt in terms of survival.37
For Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see
Section 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of
Oncology online.
SI-NETs
Macroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces
the risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and
ischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is
recommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-
denectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs
is inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the
high likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for
SI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a
systematic
lymphadenectomy
(at
least
8
nodes)
are
mandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency
setting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk
of an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally
recommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,
as the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute
or chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse
intestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic
radical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph
nodes can be achieved in 80% of cases if carried out by
experienced surgeons.40

intervention, medical treatment is required in function-
ally active tumours [IV, A].
 For NF-Pan-NETs 2 cm, a conservative approach with
surveillance consisting of yearly, high-quality imaging is
suggested [IV, B].
 For Pan-NETs >2 cm, the risk of nodal metastases is
increased, therefore, a standard pancreatectomy (pan-
creaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with
regional lymphadenectomy is recommended [IV, A].
 The presence of high-risk features (e.g. large borderline
tumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should
discourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A].
 NF-Pan-NETs in the setting of MEN1 syndrome are often
stable or slow growing; therefore, a watch-and-wait
management of these tumours can be safely adopted
when 2 cm in size [IV, A].
 When surgery is indicated, a minimally invasive approach
is recommended whenever feasible [IV, B].
 Macroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs is
recommended
along
with
systematic
mesenteric
lymphadenectomy [IV, A].
 Surgery is also recommended in the presence of locally
advanced SI-NETs, as the presence of large mesenteric
mass can cause acute or chronic intestinal obstruction
and/or localised/diffuse intestinal ischaemia [V, B].
MANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE
Surgery for metastatic disease
Given the relatively indolent behaviour of a large fraction of
GEP-NETs, surgery also plays a role in metastatic disease.41
A surgical approach is indicated in selected patients affected
by stage IV GEP-NETs who have exclusive or predominant
liver involvement, after having carefully evaluated the
tumour grading, distribution of LMs and primary site [IV, B].
Upfront surgery should be excluded in the presence of
extra-abdominal metastases and high-grade GEP-NENs [IV,
B].42 It seems reasonable to consider the presence of an
advanced NEC G3 as an absolute contraindication for sur-
gery [IV, A], whereas NET G3 should not be excluded a
priori.
Another crucial parameter for considering a surgical
approach is the distribution of LMs.43 Surgical resection
should be attempted in the presence of resectable or
potentially resectable LMs.43 A curative resection (R0, R1) of
GEP-NETs with LMs is associated with a 5-year overall sur-
vival (OS) rate of around 85%.41 Preselection biases due to
better performance status (PS) or less advanced disease are
likely to inﬂuence this result. GEP-NET LMs are frequently
more extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even
intraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to
achieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial
when multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site
and presence of symptoms are important factors to be
considered before planning a possible palliative surgical
resection.
Palliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-
ease is generally indicated for preventing complications
related to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].
However, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in
patients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement
in
survival.
A
recent
large
single-centre
experience
demonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV
disease
after
prophylactic
palliative
SI-NET
resection,
compared with no or delayed resection when needed.44
The role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is
unclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-
ating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients
affected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those
patients
with
symptoms
related
to
tumour
burden,
debulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.
Patients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-
NETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is
generally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need
for palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the
risk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-
ered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent
evidence from retrospective series suggested that primary
Pan-NET resection is associated with better long-term
outcomes.45
Nevertheless,
the
potential
advantage
of
palliative
surgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking
surgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of
survival and underlies the bias of preselection of better
prognosis patients for surgery.
Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very
selected patients with unresectable LMs when the following
criteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-
logical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67
<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-
static diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-
ease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before
transplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In
these selected patients with good baseline prognostic
factors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46
Liver transplantation is preferably considered in patients
with functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-
pies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected
by SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-
nosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed
within a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully
considering all the alternative therapeutic options.
In patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete
surgical
resection,
vascular
and
ablative
locoregional
modalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.
Locoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of
supplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology
online. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as
alternative therapy to LM resection in patients with
resectable LMs [V, C]. Combining resection and radio-
frequency ablation (RFA) may provide the opportunity to
achieve complete tumour removal, allowing more limited

resections when otherwise more extensive hepatectomies
could compromise residual liver function.
Adjuvant therapy
There are no data to support adjuvant therapy in NET G1/
G2, as data from prospective randomised clinical trials
(RCTs) are lacking [IV, A]. However, in aggressive NENs (NEC
G3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy
(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are
warranted.
Medical therapy
The goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-
associated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].
Treatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-
tide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning
NETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved
in 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations
[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly
transient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,
ﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or
slow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to
increase the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose
[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular
(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)
120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-
tion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to
alleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data
are lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.
octreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in
cases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide
LAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label
based on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when
established options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha
(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.
three times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with
SSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on
treatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,
due to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight
loss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50
Telotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan
hydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of
serotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-
ment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III
trial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS
diarrhoea (4 bowel movements per day) compared with
placebo. Durable response (deﬁned as 30% improvement
in bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study
period) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated
with 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),
respectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-
CAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-
ments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of
telotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of
liver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were
observed at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response
showed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in
global quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,
diarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250
mg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-
ated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA
and can be recommended for this indication as an add-on
treatment to SSA [I, A].
In progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide
therapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms
[II,
B],
although
efﬁcacy
may
not
be
durable
(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1
study, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two
treatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of
the patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ
octreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg
arm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration
(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly
better than the TTD in the control arm. There was no
difference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-
ing.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may
occur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-
glycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires
careful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best
select treatment options in refractory CS, either dose
escalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.
telotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).
Other treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms
include everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,
but also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it
is not approved in this indication by either the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-
tion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic
insulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by
tumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for
the risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-
trinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-
hibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are
a standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-
NETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other
bioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective
treatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs
refractory to SSA.57
Antiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy
selection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-
ment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour
extent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,
the sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence
level of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility
to drugs in different countries.
Antiproliferative
medical
treatment
options
include
targeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also
named biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in
NETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the
multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been
introduced more recently in the management of NETs. None

Somatostatin analogues. SSAs are an established anti-
proliferative therapy in metastatic GEP-NETs, based on two
placebo-controlled trials. Most frequently, they are used in
ﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the
settings in which they have been studied. Overall response
rates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed
prolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in
therapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1
and with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with
octreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with
placebo.58
The CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in
midgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver
tumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of 10%.
Most patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset. The
median progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached
with lanreotide (>27 months) and was 18 months in the
placebo arm.59 The CLARINET extension study also showed
efﬁcacy in
progressive
disease
patients with
entero-
pancreatic NETs.60 There is very good long-term tolerability
of both SSAs.47,58,59 SSAs can be recommended for tumour
growth control in advanced SSTR-positive, slowly-growing
GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I, A; European Society
for Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale
(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A; ESMO-
MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. SSAs can be recom-
mended in patients with unknown disease status, stable or

progressive disease. Tumour burden may impact the treat-
ment onset. Positive SSTR status is generally required but is
not predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly
SRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS
beneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are
still premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61
and patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have
stable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may
be applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low
tumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of
extra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A
watch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in
advanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET
G2 rather than NET G1.
IFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and
supported by recent results from a large randomised trial
(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for
IFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for
antiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have
been exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status
on functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where
there are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].
Everolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a
dose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has
shown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are
low (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies
demonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in
Pan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily
pretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in
patients with few prior therapies.63,64
The registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients
(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-
tion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-
NETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6
months with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS
beneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-
NET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS
v1.1
score:
3].
Addition
of
the
SSA
pasireotide
to
everolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt
compared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs
(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA
and everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may
be functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in
the treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further
studied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-
zotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials
(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).
The efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with
poor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4
trial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs
were
included.
Median
PFS
was
11
months
with
everolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio
(HR) 0.48]. There was a beneﬁt in terms of PFS prolon-
gation in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56 (0.37e0.8)] and the
lung NET subgroup [HR 0.5 (0.28e0.88)], and everolimus is
EMA-approved for NF-GI and lung NETs. Everolimus should
be used in patients with clearly progressive GI NETs [I, A;
ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. The efﬁcacy derived from a
post hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-
terns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum
NET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-
limus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].
However, the treatment sequence needs to be further
studied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.
Health-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-
lation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of
Cancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not
identify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-
limus as compared with placebo.69,70
The use of everolimus is less clear in patients with
advanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a
prolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in
combination with octreotide compared with placebo and
octreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by
central reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-
tients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically
beneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of
note, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a
trend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,
although not statistically different from the placebo arm.
Everolimus should be used with caution if considered for
patients with CS.72
Most frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis
(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections
(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia
(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-
istics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus
trials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.
However, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment
interruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in
individual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-
embolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation
and regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are
on everolimus treatment.
There are no data to support the use of everolimus in
NECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some
value in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are
ongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and
NECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).
Sunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-
approved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In
a randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared
with placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable
Pan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5
months) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was
<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with
sunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest
side-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in
multiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with
sunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects
include diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),
vomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%). Other side-effects include
hypertension (26%), lymphopaenia (26%) and hair colour

Sunitinib
is
recommended
in
the
management
of
advanced progressive Pan-NETs [I, A]. The drug has no
indication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising
data from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and
NEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.
The appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains
unclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual
factors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted
drugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside
of clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a
phase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated
activity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-
ulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared
with placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,
most frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81
Ongoing randomised controlled trials will provide more
data on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary
Material, available at Annals of Oncology online).
Systemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in
advanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results
with
systemic
ChT
for
advanced
well-differentiated
non-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-
atic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic
well-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%
(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended
in this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher
probability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of
15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated
with beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered
under these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).
Systemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable
LMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs
using a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].
ORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be
considered upfront in bulky disease without documented
prior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses
from European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated
in RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective
trials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,
either alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;
preliminary results from the prospective explorative two-
arm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼
145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-
based ChT and suggest superiority of the combination
therapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect
to PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,
respectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-
balanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis
to therapy in favour of the combination arm may have
impacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM
(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-
methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression
or promoter methylation for preselection of patients is
controversial.86,88
In cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from
high-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the
primary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/
etoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].
Although ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)
is very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is
crucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line
therapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective
studies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM
alone or in combination with CAP  bevacizumab, of 5-FU
intravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-
tin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90
The ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,
Ki-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/
etoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may
be considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in
selected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs
(Figure 4).
PRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-
positive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET
lesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two
peptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and
DOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90
(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity
and the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus
dosimetry.
Recently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1
trial has compared
177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8
weeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg
octreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4
weeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated
(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease
within a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously
been treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE
was superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-
mary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE
was 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose
octreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI
0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with
a higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth
PRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend
towards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with
an improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-
tion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,
pain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-
tients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs
who fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are
reported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at
further therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than
midgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational
studies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported
overall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients
with both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including
NETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut
region.54,96e98
177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by

the EMA and the FDA, not only in patients with midgut
NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] but also in patients
with Pan-NETs [III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4]. Results
from RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular
targeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-
temic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,
and PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]
(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT
should be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for
SSTR-positive Pan-NETs.
For more information about selection criteria and PRRT
biomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,
available at Annals of Oncology online.
The published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about
280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of
patients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support
the therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of
patients.99e102 The overall results show disease control
rates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e
53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients
Figure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.
The stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.
A watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be
considered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.
Locoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.
In Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-
based therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.
STZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400
mg/m2.
One author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of
targeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.

with a Ki-67 <55% compared with those with higher Ki-67
values (there are fewer patients with a Ki-67 >55%). In
patients with a Ki-67 of >35%, mPFS was 6.8 months in one
study,101 and in patient subgroups with Ki-67 >55%, mPFS
was 6 months, 4 months and 4 months, respectively from
the different studies.99,100,102 PRRT may be considered in
patients with NET G3 [IV, C], however, patients need to be
carefully selected and prospective trials are warranted to
further establish which patients with NEN G3 might beneﬁt
most from PRRT. The NETTER-2 trial has recently been
initiated to address this issue (NCT03972488).
Treatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE is in general considered
safe, however, up to 3%e4% of the patients may develop
irreversible bone marrow toxicity such as leukaemia or bone
marrow dysplasia. Mild renal toxicity grade 1/2 has been re-
ported long term in 30% of the patients (see Section 5 of
supplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology
online).

and maintenance therapy, see Section 6 of supplementary

Recommendations
 A surgical approach is indicated in selected patients
affected by stage IV GEP-NETs who show exclusive or pre-
dominant liver disease after careful evaluation of tumour
grading, distribution of LMs and primary site [IV, B].
 Upfront surgery is not indicated in the presence of extra-
abdominal metastases and high-grade GEP-NENs [IV, B].
 Presence of an advanced NEC G3 is considered an abso-
lute contraindication for an upfront surgery [IV, A].
 Palliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-
ease is generally indicated for preventing complications
related to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV,
C]. However, it is controversial if primary tumour
removal in patients with stage IV disease translates to
an improvement in survival.
 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-
toms in patients affected by metastatic functioning
SI-NETs [IV, B].
 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms
related to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery
may be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered
in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].
 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very
selected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].
 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an
alternative therapy to LM resection in patients with
resectable LMs [V, C].
 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].
However, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy
with platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].
 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid
options for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with
other systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.
The choice of the procedures depends on the local
expertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and
the localisation of liver involvement [V, C].
 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be
applied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve
control of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-
tions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)
[IV, A].
 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,
locoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-
tive to systemic treatment [IV, B].
 Systemic therapy should be administered to control
tumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth
[I, A].
 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients
with CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,
glucagonoma) [I, A].
 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-
tristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-
ment to SSAs [I, A].
 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve
symptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of
IFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].
 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant
impact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].
 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires
careful information to be given to the patient before and
directly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper
treatment [IV, A].
 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on
pathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth
behaviour and SSTR imaging.
 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients
with low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable
disease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term
favourable prognosis.
 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for
tumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing
SSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,
A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;
ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. Positive SSTR
status is generally required but is not predictive of
response.
 IFN-a can be considered for antiproliferative therapy
if other treatment options have been exploited or
are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative on functional
imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where there
are fewer therapy options compared with Pan-NETs
[IV, B].
 Everolimus is EMA-approved for progressive Pan-NET G1/
G2 with or without prior ChT, for NF-GI and lung NETs [I, A;
ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In GI NETs, everolimus should
be used in patients with clearly progressive disease [I, A].
 The use of everolimus after PRRT is recommended in
intestinal NETs, if PRRT is available [V, A], although the
treatment sequence needs to be further studied in the
absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.
 The combination therapy of SSA and everolimus for an
antiproliferative purpose is not recommended [II, D].

 Sunitinib is one of the EMA-approved treatment options
in advanced progressive Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1
score: 3].
 Both sunitinib and everolimus cannot be recommended
in NEC G3 outside of clinical trials [V, E].
 The use of systemic ChT is recommended in advanced
Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A].
B In patients with non-resectable LMs and/or other
distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs, STZ/5-FU is
recommended in progressive disease [II, A].
B TEM alone or in combination with CAP is recommen-
ded as alternative ChT in Pan-NETs [II, B].
B Systemic ChT can also be recommended in bulky
disease
without
prior
tumour
progression
in
Pan-NETs [II, B].
B Cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide is recommen-
ded standard ﬁrst-line ChT in NEC G3 [III, A]. There is
no established second-line therapy, but different
regimens [e.g. 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI),
5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin
(FOLFOX),
CAPTEM

bevacizumab] may be considered [IV, B].
 In NET G3, response rates to cisplatin/etoposide are
low, and the use of this combination is not recommen-
ded [IV, C].
 ChT cannot be recommended in well-differentiated
slowly growing NETs of the GI tract [II, C]; exceptions
may be rapidly progressive tumours or NET G2 with
higher Ki-67 close to NET G3 [V, C].
 PRRT is recommended as second-line therapy in patients
with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs who
fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT [I, A].
 177Lu-DOTATATE is EMA- and FDA-approved for patients
with midgut NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] and
Pan-NETs [III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4].
 In Pan-NETs, PRRT should be used after failure of
approved therapies [III, A].
 In carefully selected patients, PRRT may be considered in
NET G3 [IV, C].
 SSA should be combined with PRRT in patients with
functioning tumours (CS) to prevent increasing symp-
toms such as diarrhoea and/or ﬂushing and hormonal
crisis soon after PRRT [II, A].
 It is also common practice to continue SSA beyond PRRT
in functioning tumours, as a full resolution of CS-related
symptoms is rarely achieved after PRRT [II, A].
 The combination of SSA with PRRT is not recommended
in patients with NF-NETs, [IV, C] and it remains unclear if
SSA should be continued after PRRT as a maintenance
therapy.
PERSONALISED MEDICINE
In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity of
comparative
randomised
trials,
therapy
selection
in
advanced non-resectable disease is frequently based on
individual patient clinical and pathological features and
SSTR imaging [IV, A]. Several issues are unresolved: to
consider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or
systemic
therapy,
or
locoregional
therapies.
Among
systemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with
higher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact
treatment choices. The treatment selection should be based
on an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-
enced centres including experts familiar with the disease.
Recently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have
an impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in
prospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-
nostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)
of 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value
for PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103
Recommendation
 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity
of comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in
advanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-
ical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].
FOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND
SURVIVORSHIP
Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom
monitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and
SSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1
and NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that
imaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET
G2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3
months [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced
disease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging
intervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing
length of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where
shorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e
20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,
small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the
appendix
or
rectum
do
not
need
any
follow-up
if
R0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological
features [IV, A].
Imaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available
with SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive
alternative, should be included in the follow-up and is
recommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a
has been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous
SSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the
liver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be
considered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second
malignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is
inconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of
a NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-
markers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE
represents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or
NEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence
detection; the NETest has potential to predict response to
PRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was
superior to CgA in a validation study.104e106
In NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also
indicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence. NSE and
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be monitored in NEC;

---
CgA may also be elevated in NET G3. Conventional imaging
includes thoracic and abdominal scans every 2e3 months.
FDG-PET may be required in case of suspected recurrence to
discriminate lesions from unspeciﬁc ﬁndings; otherwise,
high-resolution CT is the imaging method of choice, unless
resection is considered in locally advanced NEN G3,
where FDG-PET is mandatory to exclude distant metastatic
disease.
Recommendations
 Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom
monitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional
and SSTR imaging [V, B].
 In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1eG2, it is recom-
mended that imaging is carried out every 3e6 months
(CT or MRI), and in NEC G3 every 2e3 months [V, C].
Similar staging intervals apply to advanced disease.
 Follow-up should be lifelong, although the staging inter-
vals may be extended to 1e2 years with increasing
length of follow-up.
 Small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the
appendix or rectum do not need any follow-up if
R0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological
features [IV, A].

## ABSTRACT

Background: In many solid tumors, early tumor shrinkage predicts the durability of treatment response. It is unclear whether this is the case for neuroendocrine tumors treated with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).

Methods: Data from the phase III NETTER-  1 study of [ 177 Lu]Lu-  DOTA-  TATE ( 177 Lu-  DOTATATE) for the treatment of advanced, well-  differentiated, midgut NETs were used to investigate whether objective tumor shrinkage (local review) with  177 LuDOTATATE is associated with progression-  free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) duration.

Results: Overall, 117 patients were treated with  177 Lu-  DOTATATE (four cycles of 7.4 GBq every 8 weeks). In a landmark analysis, best tumor shrinkage from baseline until data cut-  off (prior to first progression) was not associated with PFS ( n =  102; hazard ratio:  1.002 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99-1.02]; nominal p = 0.7808). In further ad hoc analyses, patients on the  177 LuDOTATATE arm were dichotomized into ≥ 30% tumor shrinkage from baseline (18/117 [15.4%]) and &lt; 30% shrinkage (99/117 [84.6%]). Median (95% CI) PFS was 17.6 (16.5-30.3) months in the ≥ 30% shrinkage group and 25.0 (19.4-31.0) months in the &lt; 30% group. OS was not significantly different for the two tumor shrinkage groups (not estimable [31.0 months-not estimable] and 44.3 [34.9-53.8] months, respectively).

Conclusions: These results suggest the benefit of PRRT and the potential PFS and OS benefit of  177 Lu-  DOTATATE should not be based on tumor shrinkage (objective response versus stable disease) and that lack of tumor shrinkage should not impact application of the approved four cycles of  177 Lu-  DOTATATE.

## 1   |   Introduction

Tumor size reduction forms the basis of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria that have been used for decades to evaluate treatment effects on solid tumors [1, 2]. In many tumor types, significant tumor shrinkage is associated with durable response and better outcomes, and early tumor shrinkage has been proposed as a prognostic factor for survival [3-8]. The relationship  between  tumor  shrinkage  and  peptide  receptor  radionuclide  therapy  (PRRT)  outcome  in  neuroendocrine  tumors (NETs) is not so obvious and poses a number of challenges [9-11]. For  example,  assessment  by  morphological  change  may  not  be ideal  for  slow-  growing  tumors,  and  the  development  of  intralesional fibrosis following PRRT can result in tumors appearing to remain the same size or even increase despite improvements in progression-  free survival (PFS) and quality of life [12-16].

Most  NETs  express  somatostatin  receptors  (SSTRs),  which  can be  used  as  a  therapeutic  target  [17-19].  Lutetium-  177  [ 177 Lu]LuDOTA-  TATE (hereafter ' 177 Lu-  DOTATATE'), a radiolabeled somatostatin analog, is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  advanced SSTR-  positive gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs [20-22]. Approval was based on results from the pivotal NETTER-  1 trial, an  open-  label,  multicenter,  phase  III  trial  of  patients  with  advanced,  well-  differentiated,  progressive,  SSTR-  positive  midgut NETs [23, 24].  177 Lu-  DOTATATE plus octreotide long-  acting repeatable (LAR) 30 mg significantly prolonged median PFS compared  with  the  control  arm  of  high-  dose  octreotide  LAR  (not reached  vs.  8.5  months;  hazard  ratio  [HR]  0.18  [95%  confidence interval  (CI):  0.11-0.29]; p &lt;  0.0001)  and  demonstrated  a  significantly greater objective response rate of 18% versus 3% with high-  dose octreotide LAR ( p &lt;  0.001) as assessed by RECIST v1.1. Overall survival (OS) with  177 Lu-  DOTATATE plus octreotide LAR 30 mg was 11.7 months longer than that observed with high-  dose octreotide LAR but was not statistically significant.

Studies suggest that, for NETs, PFS and OS benefits of treatment can be observed without the specified 30% tumor size reduction required for a partial response as defined by RECIST [11, 25-27]. The NETTER-  1 trial represents a unique example of a large randomized clinical trial that offers the opportunity to further explore whether tumor shrinkage on  177 Lu-  DOTATATE treatment is associated with more durable efficacy and superior PFS and/or OS.

## 2   |   Materials and Methods

## 2.1   |   Study Design and Patients

NETTER-  1  was  an  international,  multicenter,  open-  label,  randomized controlled phase III trial (Clini  calTr  ials.  gov identifier:  NCT01578239)  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 177 Lu-  DOTATATE in patients with advanced, well-  differentiated, SSTR-  positive midgut NETs with disease progression during treatment with octreotide LAR. Full eligibility criteria, study design, and  procedures  have  been  described  in  detail  previously  [23]. Briefly,  231  patients  were  randomized  1:1,  aged ≥ 18  years  with advanced, well-  differentiated inoperable midgut NET Grade 1 or Grade 2 (Ki67 index ≤ 20%). At baseline, patients had confirmed radiological disease progression by RECIST v1.1 while taking octreotide LAR at a standard dose (30 mg/month) and positive uptake on OctreoScan. Patients were enrolled between September 6, 2012, and January 14, 2016. The primary analysis used a data cut-  off date of June 30, 2016, and for this ad hoc analysis we used the final analysis data cut-  off date of January 18, 2021.

## 2.2   |   Treatment

Patients were randomly assigned to either the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE group (four cycles of 7.4 GBq every 8 weeks [intravenous infusion] plus best supportive care of intramuscular octreotide LAR 30 mg every 4 weeks) or the control group (treated with high-  dose octreotide LAR 60 mg every 4 weeks). Concomitant amino acid infusion was administered for renal protection. Treatment continued until disease progression, occurrence of intolerable adverse events, or withdrawal of consent. After 72 weeks, patients still in the study were to proceed to the long-  term survival follow-  up phase.

## 2.3   |   Assessments

Tumor response (change from baseline in the sum of target lesion diameters) was evaluated using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging every 12 weeks. During long-  term follow-  up, local radiographic assessments were performed every 6 months.

## 2.3.1 | Landmark Analysis (Tumor Shrinkage and PFS by Time Point)

Best tumor shrinkage was calculated based on the best percentage change from baseline (PCHG) in the sum of target lesion diameters  (based  on  local  scan  assessment)  until  each  of  the  following  time  points  and  on  or  before  first  progression  or  censoring: 150 days  (~21 weeks),  180 days  (~26 weeks),  36 weeks,  48 weeks, 72 weeks,  and  no  limit  (study  cut-  off).  Patients  whose  best  response was progressive disease (defined as a change in the sum of target lesion diameters of ≥ 20% and/or appearance of new lesions) were excluded from the analysis. Duration of PFS was determined from the relevant time point to first disease progression or death from any cause, i.e., with the exception of the 'no limit' time point (where the duration of PFS was calculated from randomization to first progression or censoring), the 'baseline' was reset at the relevant time point. Patients who were not still at risk of progression at this time point were excluded, i.e., patients who discontinued the  study,  died,  progressed,  or  who  were  missing  post-  baseline measurements prior to the relevant time point. For each treatment arm, the best response in terms of PCHG in the sum of target lesion diameters was used as a covariate in a Cox regression analysis to explain the rate of PFS endpoint events (disease progression or death from any cause). HRs, 95% CIs, and event probability estimates at different time intervals were determined separately for the two treatment arms.

## 2.3.2 | Analysis of PFS and OS by Dichotomized Tumor Shrinkage

In further ad hoc analyses, patients on the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE arm of  the  study  were  categorized  into  two  tumor  shrinkage groups

based on PCHG: 'at least 30% decrease' and 'less than 30% decrease'. For these analyses, the intent-  to-  treat principle was used, i.e.,  patients  with  a  baseline  target  lesion  diameter  but  no  postbaseline results were grouped in the '&lt; 30% decrease' category. PFS and OS were analyzed by tumor shrinkage groups. This analysis was not performed on the control group due to the small number of patients achieving a tumor shrinkage of at least 30%.

## 3   |   Results

## 3.1   |   Patient Population and Baseline Tumor Characteristics

The  NETTER-  1  full  analysis  set  (defined  as  all  patients  who underwent randomization) included 231 randomized patients, with 117 assigned to the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE group and 114 to the control group. Patient demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment groups and have been described previously [23, 24]. The mean age (SD) of study participants was 63 (9) years in the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE arm and 64 (10) years in the control arm, and 54% and 47% of participants were male,  respectively.  Overall,  11/117  (9.4%),  35/117  (29.9%),  and 71/117 (60.7%) patients in the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE arm and 13/114 (11.4%), 34/114 (29.8%), and 67/114 (58.8%) patients in the control arm had a Krenning score of 2, 3, or 4, respectively, as defined by the highest tumor uptake on OctreoScan, while under treatment with octreotide LAR (20 to 30 mg every 3 to 4 weeks for a maximum period of 3 years) [24].

## 3.2   |   Best Percentage Change From Baseline

Patient  numbers eligible for analysis at week 72 decreased to 52/117 (44.4%) in the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE group, and a faster decline was seen in the control group, with 19/114 (16.7%) eligible at the same time point. In the follow-  up phase, 64/117 (54.7%) patients  in  the 177 Lu-  DOTATATE  arm  and  49/114  (43.0%)  in the  control  arm  were  eligible  for  assessment  at  6 months;  the number of patients eligible for assessment dropped to &lt; 10% by 60 months in the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE arm and 48 months in the control arm.

Figure S1 shows the median best tumor shrinkage at each time point by treatment arm. The median (minimum, maximum) of best  PCHG prior to progression at any time point up to week 12 was 0 ( -38.5, 19.2) for the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE group ( n =  99) and 2.9 ( -54.6, 18.0) for the control group ( n =  80). Up to week 48,  the  median  of  best  PCHG  was -12.3  ( -60.0,  11.4)  for  the 177 Lu-  DOTATATE group ( n =  66) and 0 ( -46.4, 8.5) for the control  group  ( n =  31).  Up  to  week  72,  the  median  of  best  PCHG was -10.8  ( -64.0,  11.4)  and -10.6  ( -46.4,  5.0)  for  the 177 LuDOTATATE ( n =  49) and control ( n =  14) groups, respectively.

The best PCHG for each evaluable patient is shown in Figure 1. Most  patients  (78/102,  76.5%)  treated  with  177 Lu-  DOTATATE experienced  some  form  of  tumor  shrinkage,  but  only  18  patients  showed  a  change  of  at  least  30%.  Fewer  patients  in  the control group showed any tumor shrinkage (34/86, 39.5%), and only seven patients had at least 30% tumor reduction by local review. Results from central analysis, available up to week 72, did not differ significantly from those from local analysis (data not shown).

## 3.3   |   Relationship Between Best Tumor Shrinkage (Continuous Scale) and PFS

The  association  between  PFS  and  tumor  shrinkage  was  analyzed by treatment group. In the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE group, PFS did not appear to be significantly associated with tumor shrinkage (Figure 2). HRs were approximately 1.0 for all time points analyzed suggesting that  177 Lu-  DOTATATE therapy prolonged PFS even when tumor shrinkage was minimal during treatment cycles. In the control group, tumor shrinkage between baseline and ~21 weeks was associated with improved PFS ( n =  64;  HR 0.918 [95% CI: 0.865-0.974]; p =  0.005) (Figure 2). At later time points with lower patient numbers, this association was not as evident, although the relationship remained significant when no time limit (until data cut-  off) was used ( n =  86;  HR 0.967 [95% CI: 0.943-0.991]; p =  0.0065).

Tumor  shrinkage  from  baseline  for  evaluable  patients  (those who have both baseline and post-  baseline measurements) was plotted versus PFS in Figure S2.

## 3.4   |   Analysis of PFS and OS by Dichotomized Best Tumor Shrinkage

In  the 177 Lu-  DOTATATE  group,  18/117  (15.4%)  patients  had tumor shrinkage ≥ 30%, and 99/117 (84.6%) patients had tumor shrinkage &lt; 30%. Baseline disease characteristics were similar among the two tumor shrinkage groups (Table S1).

The median (95% CI) PFS was 17.6 (16.5-30.3) months for the ≥ 30%  tumor  shrinkage group and 25.0 (19.4-31.0) months for the &lt; 30% decrease group (Figure 3). Overlapping CIs indicated that tumor shrinkage had no significant association with PFS.

Similar  tumor  shrinkage  analyses  were  performed  for  OS (Figure 4). Median (95% CI) OS was not estimable (31.0 monthsnot  estimable)  for  the ≥ 30%  tumor  shrinkage  group  and  44.3 (34.9-53.8)  months  for  the  &lt; 30%  decrease  group  for  patients treated with  177 Lu-  DOTATATE. The CIs overlapped, indicating that tumor shrinkage had no significant association with OS.

Results from central analysis, available up to week 72, showed minor variations without any significant differences (data not shown).

## 4   |   Discussion

The aim of this study was to use the data from the phase III NETTER-  1  trial  to  evaluate  the  relationship  between  tumor shrinkage  and  PFS  and  OS  in  patients  with  SSTR-  positive, advanced midgut NETs. PRRT has previously been shown to result in similar OS benefits in patients with gastroenteropancreatic  NETs  (GEP-  NETs)  who  had  stable  disease  compared with  those  achieving  a  tumor  response  (complete  and  partial response) [11, 28]. Conversely, in a larger cohort of patients with

Seven patients in the control group had at least a 30% tumor reduction, but only four of these were considered a partial response due to censoring, progression of non-  target lesions, and progression at a later time point.

bronchial NETs and GEP-  NETs, a clear tendency for improved OS outcomes was observed for patients achieving an objective best tumor response compared with those with stable disease only [9].

The NETTER-  1 trial provided an opportunity to further assess this in a large, well-  defined prospective trial focused on patients with  advanced,  progressive,  well-  differentiated,  SSTR-  positive midgut NETs.

0.11-0.29]; p &lt;  0.0001) [20, 23]. In the current ad hoc analyses, there was no obvious association between best tumor shrinkage and PFS in the  177 Lu-  DOTATATE arm. When tumor shrinkage was dichotomized into &lt; 30% decrease and ≥ 30% decrease, no relationship between tumor shrinkage and PFS or OS was observed among patients treated with  177 Lu-  DOTATATE.

In the NETTER-  1 trial,  177 Lu-  DOTATATE treatment was found to  prolong  median  PFS  compared  with  high-  dose  octreotide LAR treatment (not reached vs. 8.5 months; HR 0.18 [95% CI:

These results are not altogether surprising. We might hypothesize that the lack of correlation between objective response and PFS/OS is because objective response is more likely to occur in higher proliferating tumors (which shrink by a greater percentage but then may progress more quickly) and stable disease is more  likely  to  be  the  best  response  in  more  indolent  tumors.

FIGURE 2 |    Forest plot showing the impact of a one-  unit increase in best tumor shrinkage on the hazard rate for PFS by time point (full analysis set). Best tumor shrinkage was calculated based on the best percentage change from baseline in the sum of target lesion diameters (based on local scan assessment) until each of the time points and on or before first progression. PFS was determined from the relevant time point to first disease progression or death from any cause. An HR &lt; 1.0 suggests a one-  unit increase in best tumor shrinkage may be associated with a decreased hazard rate for PFS (i.e., prolonged PFS), while an HR &gt; 1.0 suggests a one-  unit increase in best tumor shrinkage may be associated with an increased hazard rate for PFS (i.e., reduced PFS). Control: High-  dose octreotide LAR 60 mg every 4 weeks. CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; LAR, long-  acting repeatable; PFS, progression-  free survival.

However,  an  additional  study  would  be  required  to  investigate any such association. Objective tumor shrinkage may not occur  quickly,  or  indeed  at  all,  for  very  slow-  growing  NETs [10,  12,  13,  29].  However,  we  believe  it  is  more  likely  that  the mechanism of action of  177 Lu-  DOTATATE and the time required to observe best response were responsible for the overall lack of association between PFS and best tumor shrinkage in the  177 LuDOTATATE group, given that higher best tumor shrinkage (up to data cut-  off) was associated with prolonged PFS in the highdose octreotide LAR control group. It remains to be further elucidated why a subset of patients with midgut NETs that received high-  dose  octreotide  LAR  responded  with  objective  tumor shrinkage that corresponded with durable benefit. However, for patients  receiving  177 Lu-  DOTATATE, tumor size reduction on imaging can be modest and best response may take up to a year to be seen [28, 30]. Therefore, we included later time points of up to 18 months in our analysis. Practically, the mechanism of action of  177 Lu-  DOTATATE may cause heterogeneous tumor effects that can influence imaging measurements and subsequent tumor size assessments. Resulting necrosis and/or fibrosis can look like a stabilization or even an increase in tumor size on a scan [10, 13-15, 31-33]. Although it was not investigated in this study, it is possible that tumor necrosis and/or fibrosis may account, at least in part, for the relatively low response rate; however, this would require further investigation.

There are numerous reports in the literature demonstrating PFS benefits with targeted therapies in patients with NETs without objective tumor response, as defined by RECIST criteria. With targeted agents used in the treatment of NETs, including somatostatin analogs (SSAs), everolimus, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, objective response rates are low (&lt; 10%) [26, 27, 34]. Studies with everolimus for advanced NETs found a PFS benefit with only a low proportion of patients showing an objective tumor response (2%-5%) [27,  34].  Similar  results  have  been  observed  with  the SSA lanreotide when used to treat patients with metastatic pancreatic/intestinal NETs [25]. Consistent with our results, an analysis of 268 patients with GEP-  NETs and thoracic NETs treated with  177 Lu-  DOTATATE found that patients with stable disease had similar PFS and OS as patients with tumor regression based

on four response scoring systems (RECIST [ ≥ 30% decrease cutoff  for  tumor  regression],  Southwest  Oncology  Group  [SWOG; ≥ 50% cut-  off] solid tumor response criteria, modified RECIST [ ≥ 13% cut-  off], and modified SWOG [ ≥ 25% cut-  off] criteria) [11]. Approximately half of these patients (54%) were diagnosed with midgut NETs, akin to those enrolled in NETTER-  1.

Our study does have certain limitations. This analysis was not part  of  the  originally  planned  endpoints  of  NETTER-  1,  and therefore caution should be applied when interpreting the results more generally. The study only deals with a midgut NET population, and higher responses may be observed in patients with other NET primaries. Studies have suggested that the primary

location of NETs can influence the amount of tumor shrinkage observed with PRRT, with pancreatic NETs (foregut) showing more  shrinkage/objective  response  than  those  located  in  the midgut [9, 35]. Additionally, the RECIST definition of objective tumor response ( ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) is quite rigorous, and given the potential for tumor necrosis/fibrosis following PRRT, even minor tumor shrinkage may have relevance [1, 10, 13-15, 31-33]. Although consistent results were found on central analysis within a shorter observational period, our analyses are based on local review at multiple centers, which may inherently introduce some variation despite the application of a detailed protocol. Finally, the trial population size may have been insufficient to demonstrate a correlation between objective response and PFS or OS.

These data have implications for clinical practice. With regard to midgut NETs, and based on the available analysis, achieving objective  tumor  shrinkage  should  not  guide  the  use  of  PRRT with respect to the number of treatment cycles. We confirm that response  evaluation  with  RECIST  criteria  has  limitations  for assessment of the efficacy of PRRT with  177 Lu-  DOTATATE for patients with NETs. A treatment benefit exists even if the best response after a full course of treatment is stable disease.

In conclusion, the potential PFS/OS benefits of  177 Lu-  DOTATATE cannot  be  clearly  predicted  based  on  the  occurrence  of  tumor shrinkage.  A  30%  cut-  off  per  RECIST  criteria  and  best  tumor shrinkage were not associated with PFS for patients with midgut  NETs  treated  with 177 Lu-  DOTATATE.  Despite  this, 177 LuDOTATATE appeared  to  prolong  PFS  in  this  population  even when  tumor  shrinkage  was  minimal  during  treatment  cycles; therefore, lack of or minimal tumor shrinkage should not impact application of the approved four cycles of  177 Lu-  DOTATATE.

- c Data cutoff date for 50 events by investigator assessment: December 2, 2022

The table summarizes the results of interim analyses that were requested and reviewed by the Alliance Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Interim analyses of PFS per RECIST 1.1 criteria by investigator review were conducted after 109 events had occurred in the extra-pancreatic NET cohort (66% of the projected total number of events) and after 50 events had occurred in the pancreatic NET cohort (33% of the projected total number of events).  In addition, PFS was assessed in both cohorts using the available blinded independent central radiology review results.

Overall representativeness of this trial

Information regarding patient birth date, sex, race and ethnicity were reported by investigators at the time of study enrollment. Patients enrolled in the CABINET trial are representative of patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors in the United States. The breakdowns of age, sex, race, ethnicity, and primary tumor site of study participants are comparable to the general population of patients with NET in the United States. There is some heterogeneity in these factors worldwide, particularly with respect to the most prevalent primary tumor site in different regions. However, common primary sites of disease worldwide also include the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and lung.

The table lists the first anti-cancer treatment received by patients after discontinuing blinded study therapy. Twelve patients in the placebo group crossed over to receive cabozantinib on protocol after confirmation of progressive disease while receiving blinded therapy.  Two patients in the cabozantinib group continued cabozantinib after stopping blinded therapy, and one patient in the placebo arm received cabozantinib off-protocol. Fourteen patients in the cabozantinib group and two patients in the placebo group were still receiving blinded therapy at the time of the study unblinding and data cutoff date. Additionally, one patient in the cabozantinib arm never began blinded therapy.

Additional health-related quality of life correlative study methods :  The A021602-HO1 correlative study assessed health-related quality of life and disease-related symptoms in patients with extra-pancreatic and pancreatic NET tumors treated with cabozantinib versus placebo. For patients who consented to participate in this optional correlative study, patients completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-GINET21 questionnaires prior to treatment and every 12 weeks until disease progression or the start of a new anticancer therapy. Patient-reported treatment-related toxicities were also captured in the main body of the protocol using the National Cancer Institute's Patient-Reported Outcomes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) prior to treatment and once per cycle.  Finally, patients completed two LASA items assessing overall quality of life and fatigue (two items found to be important baseline measures and prognostic indicators) prior to treatment, and a Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) item at time points after starting treatment to facilitate analyses to estimate meaningful change.

Patients completed questionnaires on paper during planned clinic visits and prior to any discussion of their status with healthcare personnel.  For assessments after cessation of protocoltreatment but prior to disease progression or the start of a new anticancer therapy, a member of the site study staff could administer the booklet over the phone if no clinic visit is available for in-person completion.  EORTC QLQ-C30, GINET21, and PGIC were available in English; baseline LASA items and PRO-CTCAE were available in English and Spanish.  The main endpoint of this correlative study was the health-related quality of life summary score of the EORTC QLQ-C30 measured after treatment initiation and before disease progression or start of

new anticancer therapy.  Results of this correlative will be fully reported in a separate publication.  Additional details of this study can be found in Section 14.1 of the protocol.

## Abstract

Background: Treatment options for patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are limited. This randomized, double-blinded, phase 3 trial evaluated efficacy of cabozantinib in patients with previously treated, progressive extra-pancreatic or pancreatic NET.

Methods: The trial enrolled two independent cohorts of patients, including 203 patients with extra-pancreatic NET and 95 patients with pancreatic NET, who had received peptide receptor radionuclide therapy and/or targeted therapy. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive cabozantinib 60 mg daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints were objective response rate, overall survival, and safety.

Results: In patients with extra-pancreatic NET, median progression-free survival with cabozantinib was 8.4 months compared to 3.9 months with placebo (stratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.59, p&lt;0.001). In patients with pancreatic NET, median progression-free survival was 13.8 months compared to 4.4 months with placebo (stratified HR, 0.23; 95% CI 0.12-0.42, p&lt;0.001). Confirmed objective response rates with cabozantinib were 5% and 19% in patients with extra-pancreatic and pancreatic NET, respectively, compared to 0% with placebo. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were noted in 62-65% of patients treated with cabozantinib compared to 23-27% with placebo. Common grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events included hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, and thromboembolic events.

Conclusions: Cabozantinib significantly improves progression-free survival in patients with previously treated, progressive advanced extra-pancreatic or pancreatic NET. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of cabozantinib.

## Introduction

Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise most commonly in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and pancreas. 1  Treatment of advanced NET is guided by features including primary tumor location, pathologic differentiation and grade, presence of symptoms related to hormone secretion or extent of disease, and somatostatin receptor expression. Depending on these factors, treatment options for extra-pancreatic NET (epNET) include somatostatin analogs (SSAs), lutetium Lu-177 dotatate, or everolimus. 26  For pancreatic NET (pNET), sunitinib or alkylating agent chemotherapy also can be considered. 7-9  Most patients eventually experience progression on available therapies.

Angiogenesis plays a key role in pathogenesis of NET. 10,11  Antiangiogenic agents targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors have demonstrated activity in the treatment of NET. Cabozantinib is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including VEGF receptors, MET, AXL, and RET. 12  Clinical activity of cabozantinib was demonstrated in a phase II trial that enrolled patients with advanced epNET or pNET. 13 Based on these results, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of cabozantinib in patients with previously treated, progressive epNET or pNET (CABINET; Alliance A021602).

## Methods

## Patients

Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older and had histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic well- or moderately-differentiated, WHO grades 13 NET of extra-pancreatic or pancreatic origin. Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma without specification of differentiation status were not eligible. Patients were required to have progressive disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 in the 12 months before enrollment and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0-2 (a 5-point scale where higher numbers reflect greater disability). Disease progression or intolerance leading to treatment discontinuation of at least one FDA-approved line of therapy depending on primary tumor site was required. Because of changes in the treatment landscape and approval of Lu-177 dotatate, a protocol amendment in November 2020 expanded eligibility related to prior therapy to include Lu-177 dotatate or everolimus for patients with epNET (excluding lung NET); everolimus for lung NET; Lu-177 dotatate, everolimus or sunitinib for pNET. Before this amendment, prior therapy with everolimus was required for all patients. Continuation of somatastatin analogues was allowed if dose was stable for at least 2 months before enrollment.

## Trial Design and Treatments

The CABINET trial was a multicenter, phase 3 trial designed and conducted by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance), a member of the National Clinical Trials Network sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The trial was activated in July 2018 and enrolled patients with epNET or pNET in two independent cohorts. Within each cohort, patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib or placebo. Randomization was stratified by concurrent somatostatin analogue use and primary tumor site (midgut gastrointestinal and unknown primary versus non-midgut gastrointestinal, lung, other sites) in the epNET cohort and by concurrent somatostatin analogue use and prior sunitinib in the pNET cohort. Patients received cabozantinib (60 mg) or placebo orally once daily. Interruptions in treatment and dose reductions for cabozantinib (40 mg, then 20 mg) and placebo were specified for management of adverse events. Patients continued blinded treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. A protocol amendment activated in November 2020 permitted patients receiving placebo to crossover to open-label cabozantinib after real-time central confirmation of progressive disease.

## Endpoints and Assessment

Progression-free survival has been recommended as the primary endpoint for phase 3 trials evaluating novel systemic therapies in NET. 14,15  The primary endpoint was defined as the time from randomization to radiographic progressive disease per RECIST 1.1, as determined retrospectively by blinded independent central review (BICR), or death from any cause. Participants were evaluated every 12 weeks by radiographic imaging for tumor response and progression. If investigator assessments of progressive disease were confirmed by blinded real-time central review, patients were unblinded to treatment assignment; if progression was

not confirmed, patients continued assigned therapy without unblinding. Secondary endpoints included confirmed objective response rate, overall survival, and safety. Confirmed response rate was defined as having two consecutive scans showing complete or partial response per RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BICR. Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death of any cause. Adverse event severity and perceived attribution to study treatment were assessed by investigators using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. An optional correlative study assessed health-related quality of life (HRQL) before treatment and every 12 weeks until progression or start of new cancer treatment primarily using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and QLQ-GINET21 (see Supplement for more details). 16,17

## Statistical Analysis

The trial was designed with targeted sample sizes of 210 and 185 patients in the epNET and pNET cohorts, respectively, to provide 90% power using stratified one-sided log-rank tests to detect true hazard ratios of 0.583 and 0.568 reflecting superior progression-free survival in patients treated with cabozantinib versus placebo, with an overall significance level of 0.025 (corresponding to a two-sided significance level of 0.05). This statistical design required a total of 164 and 149 progression events for the epNET and pNET cohorts, respectively. Two interim analyses for futility were included in each cohort after 33% and 66% of the projected numbers of progression events had occurred. Alpha spending of 0.001 for efficacy was included per interim analysis (corresponding to 0.002 in a two-sided setting). Although the trial protocol design and analysis plan were based on one-sided tests for the primary endpoint, two-sided P values are reported in accordance with Journal policy (the protocol is available at nejm.org).

In May 2023, the independent Alliance Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended that the protocol-specified interim analyses of progression-free survival be performed using local assessments due to a lag in batched BICR tumor assessments and the double-blinded nature of the trial. Based on interim analyses demonstrating superior efficacy with cabozantinib (Supplementary Table 1), the DSMB recommended early termination of the trial. Unblinding of treatment assignment and crossover of patients in the placebo arm to cabozantinib treatment occurred on August 24, 2023, which was used for the data cutoff for the final analyses of the study endpoints. A prespecified analysis of overall survival was conducted based on significance of the primary analysis of progression-free survival, where hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals for overall survival between treatment arms were calculated and reported.

Efficacy analyses were conducted following the intention-to-treat principle. Hazard ratios (HR) were estimated through stratified Cox regression models and stratified log-rank tests calculated using stratification factors at randomization per the protocol design. Median progression-free survival and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each treatment arm were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. Subgroup analyses were performed by including treatment assignment, key demographic factors, and their interaction using Cox models. Response rate was calculated as the number of patients with confirmed

response divided by the total number of patients in that arm with corresponding 95% exact binomial confidence intervals. Two-sided Chi-square p-values were calculated to compare the rates between arms. Descriptive means and 95% confidence intervals were computed per arm per time point for the HRQL summary score (protocol-specified main correlative endpoint) which combines function and symptom scale scores. 18  Full statistical analysis of the HRQL data will be published separately.

## Trial Oversight

The protocol was approved by the NCI central institutional review board (CIRB). The trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. The trial was regularly monitored by the Alliance DSMB. Data were collected by the Alliance, reviewed by the study chair (J.A.C), and analyzed in collaboration with the authors. The authors wrote the manuscript, vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol. No one who is not an author contributed to writing the manuscript.

## Efficacy

Between October 2018 and August 2023, 203 patients were randomized in the epNET cohort and 95 patients randomized in the pNET cohort at 62 sites in the United States (Tables 1A and 1B; Supplemenatry Tables 2A and 2B). The demographics of enrolled patients are representative and generalizable to patients diagnosed with NET in the United States and elsewhere (Supplementary Table 3). The intent-to-treat cohorts included 7 patients with pancreatic NET who were misallocated to the extra-pancreatic NET cohort and 3 patients with extra-pancreatic NET who were misallocated to the pancreatic NET cohort by the registering site. Treatment groups were balanced for baseline demographic and disease characteristics in both cohorts, except more patients receiving cabozantinib compared with placebo in the epNET cohort had tumors of unknown primary site. In the epNET cohort, patients in both treatment arms had received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy not including SSAs; the majority had received Lu-177 dotatate and everolimus. In the pNET cohort, patients had a median of 3 and 2 prior lines of therapy in the cabozantinib and placebo treatment groups, respectively; most patients had received Lu-177 dotatate, everolimus, and temozolomide-based therapy.

As of the data cutoff date of August 24, 2023, 21 (16%) and 14 (22%) patients treated with cabozantinib and 7 (10%) and 2 (6%) patients treated with placebo were still receiving study treatment in the epNET and pNET cohorts, respectively. The most common reason for discontinuing therapy in both treatment groups of both cohorts was disease progression (Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B).

Extra-pancreatic NET CohortOf the 203 patients in this cohort, 111 progression events by BICR were reported with median follow-up of 10.2 months (95% CI: 8.2 -

13.8 months). At the data cutoff date, 71 participants (53%) in the cabozantinib group and 40 (58%) in the placebo group had disease progression or had died. Cabozantinib was associated with a 62% lower risk of disease progression or death on average compared with placebo (stratified HR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.25-0.59; p&lt;0.001; Figure 1A). Median progression-free survival was 8.4 months (95% CI: 7.6-12.7 months) with cabozantinib and 3.9 months (95% CI: 3.0-5.7 months) with placebo. Subgroup analyses by stratification factors and key factors including primary tumor site, grade, and prior treatment are shown in Figure 1C. Results from sensitivity analyses, including progression-free survival by investigator assessment and analyses accounting for misallocation of patients into the incorrect disease cohort, were consistent with the primary analysis (Supplementary Figures 2A and 3A).

Partial responses were observed in 5% of patients in the cabozantinib group (95% CI: 2% -10%) compared with 0% (95% CI: 0%-5%) in the placebo group (p=0.05). Best response of stable disease occurred in 65% with cabozantinib versus 54% with placebo, and of progressive disease in 11% with cabozantinib versus 35% with placebo (Table 2). Any reduction in target lesions was observed for 67% and 29% of the cabozantinib and placebo groups, respectively (Supplementary Figure 4A).

Median survival follow-up time was 24.2 months, with 60 (45%) and 37 (54%) deaths in the cabozantinib and placebo groups, respectively. Median overall survival was 21.9 months with cabozantinib versus 19.7 months with placebo (HR= 0.86; 95% CI: 0.561.31; Figure 1B). Subsequent anticancer therapy was received by 45% of patients in the cabozantinib group and 67% of patients in the placebo group, including 20 (33%) who crossed over to open-label cabozantinib on protocol (Supplementary Table 4). Overall HRQL remained stable over time and similar in both arms among those completing questionnaires (Supplementary Figure 5A).

Pancreatic NET CohortOf the 95 patients in this cohort, 57 progression events by BICR were reported with median follow-up of 13.8 months (95% CI: 10.1 - 19.7 months). At the data cutoff date, 32 participants (50%) in the cabozantinib group and 25 (81%) in the placebo group had disease progression or had died. Cabozantinib was associated with a 77% lower risk of disease progression or death on average compared with placebo (stratified HR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.12-0.42; p&lt;0.001; Figure 2A). Median progression-free survival was 13.8 months (95% CI: 9.2-18.5 months) with cabozantinib and 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.0-5.9 months) with placebo. Subgroup analyses are shown in Figure 2C. Sensitivity analyses, including progression-free survival by investigator assessment and analyses accounting for misallocation of patients into the incorrect disease cohort, were consistent with the primary progression-free survival analysis (Supplementary Figures 2B and 3B).

Cabozantinib resulted in a higher confirmed response rate than placebo. Partial responses were observed in 19% of patients in the cabozantinib group (95% CI: 10%-30%) compared with 0% (95% CI: 0%-11%) in the placebo group (p=0.01). Best response of stable disease occurred in 61% with cabozantinib versus 55% with placebo, and of progressive disease in 8% with cabozantinib versus 39% with placebo (Table 2). Any reduction in target

lesions was observed for 80% and 24% of the cabozantinib and placebo groups, respectively (Supplementary Figure 4B).

Median survival follow-up was 23.1 months, with 21 (33%) and 11 (35%) deaths reported in the cabozantinib and placebo groups, respectively. Median overall survival was 40 months with cabozantinib versus 31.1 months with placebo (HR= 0.95; 95% CI: 0.45 to 2.00; Figure 2B). Subsequent anticancer therapy was received by 51% of patients in the cabozantinib group and 62% of patients in the placebo group, including 12 (41%) who crossed over to open-label cabozantinib on protocol (Supplementary Table 5). Similar to the epNET cohort, overall HRQL remained stable over time and similar in both arms (Supplementary Figure 5B).

## Exposure and Safety

Extra-pancreatic NET CohortThe safety population in this cohort consisted of 132 patients treated with cabozantinib and 67 with placebo; median duration of treatment was 5.5 months (range, 0.2 to 32.4 months) and 2.8 months (range, 0.6 to 21.4 months), respectively. Dose reductions occurred in 66% of patients treated with cabozantinib and 10% treated with placebo. The median average daily dose was 38.4 mg for cabozantinib and 59.0 mg for placebo. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 31% (n = 34) and 15% (n = 9) in the cabozantinib and placebo groups, respectively.

The incidence of adverse events (any grade) attributed to study treatment was 98% with cabozantinib and 82% with placebo, with incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events of 62% with cabozantinib and 27% with placebo (Table 3A). The most common treatmentrelated grade 3 or 4 adverse events with cabozantinib were hypertension (21%), fatigue (13%), and diarrhea (11%). Grade 5 events, primarily attributed to underlying disease, occurred in nine patients (7%) in the cabozantinib group and four patients (6%) in the placebo group. Four patients in the cabozantinib group experienced a grade 5 event deemed at least possibly related to treatment [(gastric hemorrhage (n=1), cardiac arrest (n=1), cause of death not specified (n=2)].

Pancreatic NET cohortThe safety population for this cohort consisted of 63 patients treated with cabozantinib and 31 treated with placebo; median duration of treatment was 8.3 months (range, 0.5 to 39.6 months) and 2.9 months (range, 0.5 to 11.2 months), respectively. Dose reductions occurred in 68% of patients treated with cabozantinib and 19% treated with placebo. The median average daily dose was 37.9 mg for cabozantinib and 56.9 mg for placebo. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was 20% (n = 10) and 0% in the cabozantinib and placebo groups, respectively.

The incidence of adverse events (any grade) attributed to study treatment was 98% with cabozantinib and 84% with placebo, with incidence of grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events of 65% with cabozantinib and 23% with placebo (Table 3B). The most common treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events with cabozantinib were hypertension (22%), fatigue (11%), and thromboembolic events (11%). No grade 5 events were noted in the pNET cohort.

## Discussion

Cabozantinib significantly improved progression-free survival compared to placebo in patients with previously treated, progressive epNET or pNET. No overall survival difference between the treatment groups has been observed to date; however, overall survival data were not mature at the time of analyses and may have been impacted by crossover and the high rate of treatment with subsequent anticancer therapies. Adverse events observed in this trial were similar to the known safety profile of cabozantinib and consistent with what has been observed with cabozantinib as a single agent in other disease settings. 19-21  A majority of patients treated with cabozantinib required dose modifications or reductions to manage adverse events.

The treatment landscape in NET has evolved over the last fifteen years with the addition of targeted agents, Lu-177 dotatate for gastrointestinal NET and pNET, and alkylating agent chemotherapy with temozolomide-based regimens for patients with pNET. Use of these agents in clinical practice can be extended to NET arising in other locations. Because disease ultimately will progress on these agents, additional therapies are needed. The CABINET trial is a randomized study designed to evaluate efficacy of therapy following treatment with FDA-approved therapies such as Lu-177 dotatate and/or targeted therapy. The results support the use of cabozantinib as a new treatment option for patients with advanced extra-pancreatic NET or pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after or who have experienced intolerance of at least one other line of therapy for their disease, not including somatostatin analogs. Choice of therapy should be individualized and based on patient and tumor characteristics. Future clinical trials evaluating optimal sequencing of therapy are needed.

Although our results show significant efficacy of cabozantinib, several limitations deserve comment. The early termination of the trial based on interim analysis results could potentially lead to overestimation of treatment effect. However, results for both cohorts represent relatively mature analyses of progression-free survival. In the epNET cohort, 111 of the planned 164 events had been observed, and in the pNET cohort, 57 of the 95 enrolled patients experienced a progression event by BICR. Second, placebo rather than an active comparator was used. Notably, placebo was selected because the efficacy of therapy for patients with advanced NET whose disease has progressed after treatment with Lu-177 dotatate and/or targeted agents has not been well established. Although everolimus, sunitinib, and Lu-177 dotatate are approved agents, the phase 3 trials evaluating these agents were conducted primarily in patients who had not yet received molecularly targeted therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy. Furthermore, placebo was chosen as a control because patients could have received all available therapies before enrollment on the trial.

Antiangiogenic agents and tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the VEGF receptor have established efficacy in the treatment of NET, and sunitinib is approved for treatment of pNET based on the results of a phase 3 trial. 7  Other VEGF receptor targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including axitinib, lenvatinib, pazopanib, and surufatinib, have been evaluated in epNET and/or pNET, but are not approved for treatment in the United States or Europe. 22-26  The anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab has also been evaluated

in randomized trials in NET. 27,28  The antitumor activity of cabozantinib may be related to its receptor targets, including MET. Previous studies have demonstrated that MET activation can stimulate growth of NET and contribute to increased tumor invasion and metastasis that can be overcome by combining anti-VEGF therapy with a MET inhibitor or treatment with cabozantinib. 12,29,30  Inhibition of MET and AXL also can impede resistance to VEGF inhibition and may contribute to superior efficacy with cabozantinib compared to sunitinib in patients with renal cell carcinoma. 21,31

In conclusion, cabozantinib increases progression-free survival in patients with epNET or pNET that has progressed after prior therapy with Lu-177 dotatate or targeted agents including everolimus or sunitinib. Adverse events, which were managed with dose reduction in a majority of patients, are consistent with cabozantinib's known safety profile.

Panel A demonstrates the results of progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed retrospectively per RECIST 1.1 criteria by blinded independent central review (BICR), for patients enrolled in the epNET cohort. For the comparison between treatment groups, two-sided stratified log-rank P-value &lt;0.001. Panel B demonstrates the results of overall survival of patients enrolled in the epNET cohort. Panel C demonstrates the results of PFS according to stratification factors and selected clinical subgroups of patients enrolled in the epNET cohort. For the Tumor Grade subgroup analysis, the 'Unknown' subgroup is not displayed in the figure due to having zero PFS events in at least one treatment arm.

## Figure 2: Progression-free Survival According to Blinded Independent Central Review and Overall Survival of Patients Enrolled in the Pancreatic NET Cohort

Panel A demonstrates the results of progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed retrospectively per RECIST 1.1 criteria by blinded independent central review (BICR), for patients enrolled in the pNET cohort. For the comparison between treatment groups, twosided stratified log-rank P-value &lt;0.001. Panel B demonstrates the results of overall survival of patients enrolled in the pNET cohort. Panel C demonstrates the results of PFS according to stratification factors and selected clinical subgroups of patients enrolled in the pNET cohort. For the Histologic Differentiation subgroup analysis, 'Moderately differentiated' and 'Not specified' subgroups are not displayed in the figure due to having zero PFS events in at least one treatment arm.

Objective response rate was defined as the percentage of patients who had a confirmed complete or partial response by blinded independent central review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. All responses were partial responses. Chi-square tests were used to compare the response rates between the two groups.

Keywords: Neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) Phase II trial Folfiri Captem

Circulating miRNA

Background: Neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NECs) prognosis is poor.No standard second-line therapy is currently recognized after failure of platinum-based first-line treatment. FOLFIRI and CAPTEM regimens have shown promising activity in preliminary studies. We aimed to evaluate these regimens in metastatic NEC patients. Methods: This is an open-label, multicenter, randomized non-comparative phase II trial to evaluate the activity and safety of FOLFIRI or CAPTEM in metastatic NEC patients. Primary endpoints were the 12 weeks-Disease Control Rate (12w-DCR) by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1 and safety per CTCAE v5.0. Additional endpoints included overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

Patients ' serum samples were subject to NGS miRNome profiling in comparison with healthy donors to reveal differentially expressed miRNAs as candidate circulating biomarkers. Results: The study was halted for futility at interim analysis, as the minimum 12w-DCR threshold of 10 out of 25 patients required for the first step was not reached. From 06/03/2017 to 18/01/2021, 53 out of 112 patients were enrolled. Median follow-up was 22.6 months (range: 1.4 -60.4). The 12w-DCR was 39.1 % in the FOLFIRI arm and 28.0 % in the CAPTEM arm. In the FOLFIRI subgroup the 12-months OS rate was 28.4 % (95 % CI: 12.7 -46.5) while in the CAPTEM subgroup it was 32.4 % (95 % CI: 14.9 -51.3). The most common G3-G4 side effects were neutropenia ( n = 5, 18.5 %) and anemia ( n = 2, 7.4 %) for FOLFIRI and G3-G4 thrombocytopenia ( n = 2, 8.0 %), G4 nausea/vomiting ( n = 1, 4.0 %) for CAPTEM. Three microRNAs emerged as NEC independent predictors. High expression values were found to be significantly associated with decreased PFS and OS. The safety profile of FOLFIRI and CAPTEM was manageable. FOLFIRI and CAPTEM chemotherapy

Conclusion: showed comparable activity in the second-line setting after progression on etoposide/platinum. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03387592

## 1. Introduction

Neuroendocrine Carcinomas (NECs) are very rare malignancies, representing only 5 % GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 10 % of Neuroendocrine Neoplasia (NENs). [1 -3] These tumors are characterized by aggressive histological features (high Ki-67 index, extensive necrosis, and nuclear atypia) and are classified as grade (G)3 NECs according to the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification.[4]

Platinum-based combinations are the gold standard for the treatment of NECs, and several studies published in the 1990s reported substantial antitumor activity and high response rates (41 % GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 67 %). [5] However, responses are usually short-lasting, with a median progression-free survival of 9 months and a median overall survival of 15 -19 months. When progression occurs after first-line chemotherapy, the disease is usually very aggressive and patients succumb rapidly. [6].

Given the rarity of this disease, prospective clinical data are lacking and treatment recommendations are essentially expert-based opinions. For this reason, several efforts have recently focused on the identification of new treatment options for these patients. A French multicenter prospective phase II trial investigating the efficacy of the bevacizumabFOLFIRI combination after progression on platinum-etoposide has been recently completed and data presented. [7] Different second-line chemotherapy combinations have been evaluated showing modest results. [6,8,9] In a single-institution retrospective clinical trial, Hentic et al. observed an objective response in 31 % of patients with extrapulmonary NECs treated with FOLFIRI as second-line therapy and a disease control rate (DCR) of 62 %. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4 and 18 months, respectively.[10] In another retrospective study, a 71 % DCR was obtained with temozolomide-based chemotherapy. A OS of 22 months was reported in patients who responded to treatment or showed stable disease (SD), whereas OS was only 8 months in non-responders. The authors observed a higher response rate in patients with Ki-67 ≤ 60, in the group with high uptake in somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) and in those with positive staining for chromogranin A (CgA), often associated with more differentiated tumors.[11] Published results on lung NECs in progression after first-line chemotherapy are based on small patient series. [12].

The last WHO classification recognized a further group called G3 NETs as having intermediate features between NETs and NECs.4 The 2 subgroups display a distinct prognosis and different sensitivity to chemotherapy. [13 -15] Therefore, there is also an urgent need for more accurate biomarkers to help diagnostic assessment of NEC and identify patients that will most likely respond to chemotherapy. In a study recently published on GEP-NEC patients undergoing first-line platinum-based therapy, median PFS was 19.3 months and 6.3 months ( P &lt; 0.01) in patients with Ki-67 % &lt; 50 % or &gt; 50 %, respectively. [16] Median (m)OS was 8.1 months in the latter group but was not reached in the former group ( P = 0.039). Our previously published data highlighted that 68 Ga-PET/CT positivity may be a discriminating factor in predicting prognosis, especially in the metastatic setting where histological material is not always available.15,16 Also 18 fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 FDG)-PET/CT could be useful to discriminate patients with different prognosis. [17] Micro(mi)RNAs, a class of small, non-coding, single-stranded RNAs, are also known to show specific expression patterns in several types of tumors, including NETs.[18 -20] MiRNA are very promising biomarkers as they allow for non-invasive and continuous tumor sampling with implication for early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression and treatment outcomes. However, little is known about differential miRNA profiles in NEC patients. [21].

Given the above premises, we decided to investigate the efficacy and safety of second-line FOLFIRI or CAPTEM in patients with GEP and lung NECs in progression after first-line platinum-based treatment. The miRNome profiling of serum samples from enrolled patients in comparison with healthy donors was performed to identify potential circulating biomarkers.

## 2. Methods

## 2.1. Study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria and treatment

The SENECA study (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT03387592) is a multicenter, randomized, non-comparative, phase II study (Figure 1). Patients with metastatic neuroendocrine carcinomas of different origin (lung or gastroenteropancreatic tract) progressive on first-line treatment were randomized to receive FOLFIRI every 14 days for a maximum of 12 cycles or until progression or unacceptable toxicity, or CAPTEM every 28 days for a maximum of 6 cycles or until progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The treatment arms were as follows: FOLFIRI regimen.

- GLYPH&lt;0&gt; Irinotecan 180 mg/m2, given as a 60 min intravenous infusion on day 1 every 2 weeks followed by
- GLYPH&lt;0&gt; Leucovorin 200 mg/m2, given as a 2 h intravenous infusion on day 1 every 2 weeks followed by
- GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg/m2 given as bolus, and then 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 given as a 48 h continuous infusion on day 1, every 2 weeks.

## CAPTEM regimen.

- GLYPH&lt;0&gt; Capecitabine 750 mg/m2 two times a day on days 1 -14
- GLYPH&lt;0&gt; Temozolomide 200 mg/m2 daily on days 10 -14, every 4 weeks

The study included patients aged ≥ 18 years with a histological diagnosis of GEP- or lung neuroendocrine carcinoma. Small cell lung neuroendocrine carcinoma and mixed tumours were excluded. All enrolled patients had measurable disease according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2 with a life expectancy &gt; 3 months. Progression on or after platinum-based

chemotherapy (cisplatin/etoposide, carboplatin/etoposide, FOLFOX or CAPOX) was required for study eligibility. Adequate haematological, liver and renal function was required, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients before enrollment in the study.

## 2.2. Outcomes

The primary endpoint of the study was the DCR of each treatment, defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete or partial response or stable disease by RECIST version 1.1 criteria for at least 12 weeks from the start of therapy. Acute and late toxicity were evaluated by CTCAE Version 4.03, the latter defined as toxicity occurring at least 30 days after the end of the last treatment cycle. Secondary endpoints were the evaluation of OS, calculated from the start of treatment to death from any cause and PFS, calculated from the start of treatment to the date of the first documented evidence of disease progression or of death from any cause. For quality of life analysis, the QLQC30 questionnaire was administered. It is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale.

Complete response, partial response or stable disease for at least 12 weeks were considered as the DCR.

This study was performed in full collaboration with several Italian Centers, some of them belonging to EURACAN or ENETS center of excellence. The protocol was approved by the relevant institutional review boards and ethics committees and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent before study enrollment.

## 2.3. MiRNAs profiling

For miRNA analysis serum samples were obtained from 18 patients enrolled in the SENECA study and 20 healthy donors. All participants signed a specific informed consent.

Bryant and Day design was used to estimate a sample size which takes into account both activity and toxicity. An α level of 0.10 (for both toxicity and DCR) and a power of 90 % were adopted. A 12 weeks DCR rate ≥ 60 % and a toxicity rate ≤ 20 % were considered acceptable rates while a DCR rate ≤ 40 % and a relevant toxicity rate ≥ 40 % were considered inacceptable rates. Given these hypotheses, the first step of the study required 25 patients. If ≥ 10 patients with a DCR were observed and ≥ 15 patients did not have relevant toxicity, the study could enroll patients in the subsequent step. A total of 53 patients would have been then enrolled. If ≥ 25 patients with DCR and ≥ 36 patients without any relevant toxicity were observed, treatment would have been considered active and non-toxic. Taking into account a 5 % dropout rate, 56 patients had to be enrolled in each arm (total 112 patients). G3 -4 gastrointestinal toxicity, G4 thrombocytopenia, prolonged G3-G4 neutropenia ( &gt; 7 days) and drug-related hospitalizations were considered relevant toxicity. The stratification factors of this study included Ki-67 (21 % GLYPH&lt;0&gt; 55 % versus &gt; 55 %) and site of primary tumor (lung versus GEP).

Purification of cell-free total RNA, which primarily includes small RNAs including miRNAs, was performed from serum using miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit (Qiagen), according to manufacturer ' s protocol. Libraries were then prepared starting from 5 μ l of RNA using QIAseq ® miRNA Library Kit, containing integrated unique molecular indices (UMIs) to enhance differential expression analysis. Briefly, adapters were ligated sequentially to the 3 ′ and 5 ′ ends of miRNAs. Subsequently, universal cDNA synthesis with UMI assignment, cDNA cleanup, library amplification, and library cleanup were performed. Resulting libraries were then checked for quality using Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 to evaluate the presence of the ≈ 180 bp peak, and concentration was determined using a Qubit Fluorimeter. The samples were pooled in equimolar ratios and the resulting pooled library was then diluted at a final concentration of 1.6pM and sequenced using NextSeq ™ 550Dx High Output Reagent Kit v2.5 (75 cycles). Primary data analyses (UMIs count and miRNA sequences mapping) were then performed with proprietary online tool available at geneglobe.qiagen.com.

## 2.4. Statistical analysis

The primary objective of this study was to assess the DCR of FOLFIRI and CAPTEM regimens in patients with metastatic NECs of GEP or lung origin after failure of a first-line platinum-based treatment. Safety analysis was a co-primary objective. Analysis on primary objective was performed on the Intention-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as the

population of all enrolled patients. Toxicity evaluation was assessed on safety population (SP) which was defined as all patients who received, in each treatment group, at least one cycle of treatment. Continuous variables were presented as median (range) and categorical variables were presented as absolute or relative frequencies. Time-to-event data (PFS, OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier curves [22] and compared using the log-rank test. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (95 % CI) were calculated by non-parametric methods. Estimated HRs and their 95 % CI were calculated using univariate Cox proportional hazard models. The DCR was calculated with an exact 95 % CI using standard methods based on binomial distribution. Scoring of global health status, functional scales and symptom scales were calculated according to EORTC QLQ-C30 Scoring Manual. Descriptive data as mean and standard deviation was used to show QLQ-C30 scores between baseline and 3 months visit.

To study the role of biomarkers, the Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normality distribution of each investigated biomarker, and nonparametric tests including Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney or Chi-Square test, as appropriate, were used when the normality distribution assumption was not respected to analyze the relationship between the serum levels of each marker, considered as continuous variables, and the different subgroups. ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves were used to identify optimal cut-offs of biomarkers for predicting OS.

The analysis on all endpoints were performed separately on each group of treatment.

Statistical significance for all tests was defined as P &lt; 0.05 (twosided). Statistical analysis was carried out using Stata/SE version 15.1 for Windows (StataCorpLP, College Station, TX, USA).

## 2.5. Randomization

Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive FOLFIRI or CAPTEM using the blocked randomization method, with random block sizes. Study statistician had generated the allocation sequence using a computer software (nQuery) and the patient ' s attribution was done through a phone call by a physician to the central coordinating office for each patient assignment at the patient ' s study inclusion time, to ensure concealed allocation.

Randomization will be stratified according to the ki67 value (21 -55 % versus &gt; 55 %), morphology and site of primary tumor (Lung + other versus GEP). Neither patients nor investigators were masked to group assignment.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Patients

From 06/03/2017 to 18/01/2021, 53 out of 112 patients initially planned were enrolled in 17 of 23 participating centers. The main characteristics of enrolled patients are shown in Table 1.

## 3.2. FOLFIRI arm: efficacy and safety

At the date of interim analysis, 28 patients were enrolled in the FOLFIRI arm. Of these, 24 patients underwent the first disease evaluation at 3 months as per protocol. One patient performed a disease evaluation at 60 days due to local investigator ' s decision. Three patients progressed clinically and did not undergo radiological evaluation. The DCR was 39.1 %, with progression recorded as best response in 15 patients (60.9 %). The patient with a 60 days disease evaluation was stable. Four patients (16.7 %) obtained a partial response (Figure 2). As shown in Fig. 3A, the 6-months PFS rate was 34.6 % (95 % CI: 17.5 -52.5) and 6-months and 12-months OS rate were 52.8 % (95 % CI: 32.0 -69.9) and 28.4 % (95 % CI: 12.7 -46.5) respectively (Fig. 3B). The mOS was 6.7 (95 % CI: 4.1 -11.3) months. In the pre-planned subgroup analysis according to the Ki-67 index &lt; or &gt; 55 %, the mPFS of the first

Median follow up was 22.6 (range 1.4-60.4) months.

group ( n = 8) was 8.5 months (95 % CI: 2.0 -13.6) with a 6- and 12months PFS rate of 87.5 % (95 % CI: 38.7 -98.1) and 25.0 % (95 % CI: 3.7 -55.8) respectively. When Ki-67 &gt; 55 % ( n = 18) the mPFS was 2.9 months (95 % CI: 1.9 -3.2) and the 6- and 12-months PFS rates were 11.1 % (95 % CI: 1.9 -29.8) and 5.6 % (95 % CI: 0.4 -22.4). The median OS was 13.5 months (95 % CI: 5.2-Not Estimable) in the first group and 4.3 (95 % CI: 2.8 -6.7) months in the second one.

In the safety assessment for the interim analysis in the FOLFIRI arm, G3-G4 relevant toxicity was seen in 6 (21.4 %) of 28 patients. Three patients had a prolonged G3 neutropenia for more than 7 days (10.7 %), 1 patient a G3 anemia, 1 patient a G3 pneumonitis possibly related to the treatment and 1 patient a G3 herpes zoster infection.

Treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 15 out of 27 patients (55.5 %) enrolled in the FOLFIRI arm. The most common TRAEs were G1 vomiting (22.2 %), G1 nausea (22.2 %) and G1 fatigue (22.2 %).

Grade 3 Neutropenia occurred in 4 cases (14.8 %) and Grade 4 neutropenia in 1 case (3.7 %). A grade 4 renal failure was recorded in the FOLFIRI arm, but was likely related to globally worsened clinical conditions rather than the treatment itself.

Only one patient interrupted the treatment with FOLFIRI because of unacceptable toxicities. Dose reductions were required in 9 of 27 patients (33.3 %). At least one treatment delay was recorded in 12 patients (44.4 %): in seven (25.9 %) for hematological toxicity and in 5 (18.5 %) for not hematological ones. The median time to first dose reduction was 4.6 weeks (range: 1.0 -16.0).

## 3.3. CAPTEM arm: efficacy and safety

At the date of interim analysis, 25 patients were enrolled and 23 of them completed the first scheduled disease evaluation.

The DCR was 28.0 % and 3 patients (12.0 %) obtained a partial response (Figure 4). Sixteen patients had a progressive disease after the first radiological evaluation (64.0 %). Two patients clinically progressed (8.0 %). The 6-months and 12-months PFS rate was 8.0 % (95 % CI: 1.4 -22.5) and 4.0 % (95 % CI: 0.3 -17.0), respectively (Fig. 5A).

The mOS was 7.4 months (95 % CI: 3.7 -12.5) while the 6-months and 12-months OS rate were 54.2 (95 % CI: 32.7 -71.4) and 32.4 (95 % CI: 14.9 -51.2), respectively (Fig. 5B).

In the CAPTEM arm patients with a Ki-67 value &lt; of 55 % had mPFS of 4.1 (95 % CI: 1.1 -9.4) months with a 6-months PFS rate of 28.6 % (95 % CI: 4.1 -61.1). In patients with Ki-67 higher than 55 % mPFS was 2.0 (95 % CI: 1.6 -2.9) months. The mOS was not reached in the Ki-67

&lt; 55 % group and 4.5 % (95 % CI: 2.8 -9.2) months in the second group. In the safety assessment for the interim analysis in the CAPTEM group, G3-G4 relevant toxicities were seen in 6 (21.4 %) out of 28 patients. Only three patients experienced a prolonged G3 neutropenia for more than 7 days (10.7 %), 1 patient a G3 anemia, 1 patient a G3 pneumonitis possibly related to the treatment and 1 patient a G3 herpes zoster infection.

questionnaires at enrollment and after 3 months of treatment. As shown in Figure 6, a worsening was observed for both functional and symptoms domains in patients who progressed within 3 months, while a reduction in symptoms was observed at 3 months for responding patients or those with stable disease.

Overall, treatment-related AEs (TRAEs) occurred in 16 out of 25 patients (64.0 %) enrolled.

No patients interrupted the CAPTEM treatment due to unacceptable toxicity. Dose reductions were required in 2 out of 25 patients (8.0 %; patient decision and haematological toxicity in one patient respectively). At least one treatment delay was recorded in 8 patients (36.4 %): in 2 patients (8.0 %) because of hematological toxicity and in 1 patient (4.0 %) because of non-hematological adverse events. The median time to first dose reduction was 4.6 weeks (range: 1.0 -16.0).

Overall, recorded adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of both FOLFIRI and CAPTEM (Table 2).

## 3.4. Quality of Life

Twenty-four patients answered all items of EORTC QLQ-C30

## 3.5. Identification of circulating microRNAs

Serum samples of 18 patients enrolled in the study were subjected to NGS miRNome profiling in comparison with 20 healthy donors to reveal differentially expressed miRNAs as candidate circulating biomarkers. The median age was 34.9 years (range: 28.6 -53.6) in the healthy group and 60.5 years (range: 35.8 -78.4) in the patient group. Males and females were equally distributed (Table 3).

Twenty miRNAs were found to be upregulated in NEC patients compared to healthy subjects (Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. S1).

In order to take into account the differences in the age distribution of patients versus healthy donors that might influence miRNA expression, age was added in logistic models as covariate. Three miRNAs remained as NEC independent predictors and separated patients from healthy donors, after the introduction of age as covariate: miR-1246, miR-1290 and miR-320c (Fig. 7A). The receiver operating characteristics (ROC)

curve indicated a good diagnostic accuracy in separating patients versus healthy donors with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9417 (95 % CI: 0.83 -1.00) for miR-1246, 0.9167 (95 % CI: 0.80 -1.00) for miR-1290, and 0.9333 (95 % CI: 0.83 -1.00) for miR-320c (Fig. 7B).

An explorative analysis was carried out and a specific cut off was found considering ROC curves for selected miR and 6-months PFS and OS as events. High expression values of these 3 miRNAs were also significantly associated with decreased mPFS and mOS (Table 5). Patients with an expression of miR-1246 &lt; 690 expression ≥ 690 had a mPFS of 2.9 months (95 % CI: 2.0 -7.8, P = 0.029). Similarly, patients with a miR-1290 expression &lt; 241 had a mPFS of 7.9 months (95 % CI: 4.1-Not Estimable) respect to patients who had ≥ 214 that had 2.8 months (95 % CI: 1.0 -7.9, P = 0.025). Finally, patients with a miR-320c expression &lt; 4242 had a mPFS of 7.9 months (95 % CI: 2.8 -9.4) against 2.7 months (95 % CI: 1.0 -4.1) reported by patients with a miR-320c expression ≥ 4242, P = 0.016) (Fig. 8A). An area under the curve (AUC) of 0.7250 (95 % CI: 0.46 -0.98) for miR-1246, 0.7375 (95 % CI: 0.47 -0.99) for miR-1290, and 0.7500 (95 % CI: 0.51 -0.99) for miR-320c were observed, taking account of 6-months PFS (Fig. 8B).

Regarding OS, expression values of miR-1246 were not significantly associated with OS, although a trend was observed: patients with a miR1246 expression lower than 3407 had a mOS of 10.7 months (95 % CI: 7.4-Not Estimable) while patients with values higher than the cut-off had a mOS of 3.8 months (1.12-Not Estimable, P = 0.093). Patients with an expression of miR-1290 &lt; 1734 had a mOS of 13.2 months (95 % CI: 9.2 -23.9) while patients with an expression ≥ 1734 had a

## 4. Discussion

To date, there is no truly effective second-line chemotherapy for patients with NEC. The overall prognosis of these patients is poor, with an OS of approximately 5 months in the metastatic setting according to the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database. [23] Our study confirms the poor prognosis of these rare and aggressive tumors and fails to identify an effective regimen for their second-line treatment.

Despite the fact that we did not reach the primary end-point and the trial was stopped prematurely due to futility, some information can be extrapolated by the results presented. In a recent published metaanalysis, second-line therapy for patients with advanced extrapulmonary NEC had limited efficacy, and a high Ki-67 was associated with poor treatment outcomes, as reported previously in the NORDIC NEC study. [24].

Median response rate was 18 % (range 0 -50; 0 % for single-agent everolimus, temozolomide, topotecan; 50 % with amrubicin). Median PFS was 2.5 months (range 1.2 -6.0) and median OS was 7.6 months (range 3.2 -22). In our study the mOS was 6.4 months in the FOLFIRI arm and 7.4 months in the CAPTEM arm, similarly to what reported in this analysis. Moreover, stratification of patients demonstrated different responses to treatments and different outcomes according to Ki67 values. In particular, the mOS differed substantially between patients with ki67 levels &lt; and &gt; of 55 % and it was longer in the first group than in the second one in both treatments ' arms. [24] Similarly, in the NORDIC NEC study the mOS was 14 versus 10 months in patients with ki67 value &lt; or &gt; 55 %. [25].

The BEVANEC study data were recently published. [7] In this randomized, multicentre, non-comparative phase II study, mOS was 7.0 months (95 % CI: 4.6 -11.5) in the FOLFIRI + BEVACIZUMAB arm and 8.9 months in the FOLFIRI one. These results are similar to those described in our study in the FOLFIRI subgroup confirming the impact of this latter on the patients ' outcomes. Our trial is the first to present prospective data on the efficacy of FOLFIRI and CAPTEM in a homogeneous population of NEC patients. Another phase II study with temozolomide monotherapy has been recently published with a very short PFS and a mOS of 7.0 months. However, the sample size was low and the primary tumor location of the patients enrolled was very

heterogeneous. [26].

Similarly, preliminary data of the randomized, multicentre phase II NET-2 trial about liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU)/folinic acid or docetaxel as second-line therapy in patients with progressive poorly differentiated extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma have been recently presented. The 6-months PFS rate was 32.1 (lower 95 % CI: 17.9) in 28 patients treated with nal-IRI/5-FU/folinic acid and 14.8 (lower 95 % CI: 5.2) in 27 patients treated with Docetaxel. Despite the data having not been cleaned and a direct comparison is not possible, the activity of Irinotecan seems to be confirmed while docetaxel fails as a possible therapeutic option in EP-NEC. However there are some differences between SENECA study and NET-= 2 in the study design and characteristics of enrolled patients. [27].

In addition, we conducted an exploratory analysis on circulating miRNAs in the enrolled patients to collect information on potential disease biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic relevance. We identified 3 circulating miRNAs that are NEC independent predictors and separate patients from healthy subjects. High levels of these miRNAs were found to be significantly associated with worse disease outcomes in terms of PFS and OS. The 3 identified miRNAs are known to be

implicated in tumor stemness, aggressiveness and resistance to chemotherapy, and have been investigated as non-invasive biomarkers in various cancer types. [28 -32] Selected circulating miRNAs could be used to discriminate patients from healthy individuals making them ideal tools for an earlier diagnosis. Moreover, miRNAs are reliable candidates for disease monitoring as they change throughout tumor progression. The identification of liquid biomarkers might introduce potential benefits in the patient management, especially for these rare tumors where biomarker-driven approaches are missing.

There are some limitations to the present study. The lack of benefit observed should also be considered in the context of the ambitious end point targeted considering the poor outcome of the disease. Infact, the impact of both regimens on overall survival is of value. We would point out that the absence of a single response prevented us from reaching the primary endpoint in the Folfiri arm, as we decided to not include a patient who obtained a RECIST SD at 60 days as per protocol. Another limitation is the lack of a centralized pathology report. However, this limitation was partially mitigated by the long-lasting expertise possessed by the most of enrolling centres.

## 5. Conclusion

Although we didn ' t reach the primary endpoint, our study suggests that chemotherapy with FOLFIRI or CAPTEM could be active and safe as second line therapy in NEC patients and are able to improve the quality of life of these patients. In particular, CAPTEM does not seem to be inferior to FOLFIRI as second-line treatment for patients with NECs (although there is no formal comparison here). As result, CAPTEM or FOLFIRI might be used interchangeably in the second-line setting, with the choice being driven by patient comorbidities/chemo regimen toxicity profile.

Finally, the miRNAs identified in this study could be useful to introduce new reliable biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Longitudinal analysis of the selected miRNAs is warranted to investigate their clinical usefulness.

## Research offers novel insights to refine first-line treatment in GEP-NETs

Data from new clinical trials reported positive results of radioligand therapy over everolimus and sunitinib, and explore the combination of everolimus and somatostatin analogues

For patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs), a heterogeneous group of tumours located in the gastric mucosa, the small and large intestine, the rectum or the pancreas, the year 2025 has started with some promising data from research that may help reFne treatment strategies in the Frst-line setting.

As presented at the 22nd Annual Conference of the European Neuroendocrine Tumors Society (ENETS) in March, initial results of the prospective, randomised, controlled, open-label Phase III COMPETE trial showed that treatment with radiopharmaceutical agent [ Lu]Lu-edotreotide demonstrated a statistically 177

signiFcant clinical beneFt compared with protein kinase inhibitor everolimus in patients with grade 1 or 2 metastatic GEP-NETs. In the study, which involved a total of 309 patients with grade 1 o 2 inoperable, progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive GEP-NET, the radioligand therapy led to a prolonged median progression-free survival (PFS) compared to everolimus (23.9 versus 14.1 months, respectively) [p=0.022; hazard ratio (HR) 0.67; 95% CI 0.48, 0.95].

At a median follow up of 40.9 months, a lower proportion of patients in the Lu-edotreotide arm experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) compared to those treated with everolimus (82.5% vs 97.0% respectively), and the radioligand therapy was overall well tolerated. 'COMPETE is the 7rst trial to directly compare peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) to targeted therapy in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours and non-functioning gastrointestinal NETs, pretreated or treatment naïve. It is a practice-informing trial, supporting PRRT as the preferred choice over everolimus, given its signiFcant advantage in PFS and more favourable toxicity proFle. While overall survival data remain immature, PRRT appears to offer greater long-term bene7t than everolimus,' says Dr Melissa Frizziero , The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, UK, commenting on the study Fndings. The positive Fndings of the COMPETE study support the early use of PPRT, aligning with the results of another study, the NETTER-2 in grade 2 and well-differentiated grade 3 NETs (Lancet. 2024 Jun 29;403(10446):2807-2817). 'Another notable aspect is that PRRT was administered without concurrent SSA, except in functioning tumours. Despite this, PFS remained around two years suggesting that SSA may not be essential unless required for symptom control.' 177

At ENETS's conference, secondary results of the OCLURANDUM trial evaluating the antitumour eicacy of PRRT with 177lutetium-octreotate (OCLU; octreotate is synonymous with DOTA-TATE) versus sunitinib in patients with advanced progressive pancreatic NETs were also presented. Primary endpoint data from the study were discussed at the ESMO Congress 2022 showing a signiFcantly longer PFS with PRRT with OCLU versus sunitinib within 12 months according to RECIST 1.1. A higher PR rate was reported with 177lutetium-octreotate compared to sunitinib (63% versus 30%) with a median PFS of 20.7 months in the OCLU arm (95% CI 17.2-25.5) versus 11 months in the sunitinib arm (95% CI 8.7-13.7) while a longer median overall survival (OS) was reported with the oral targeted therapy compared to the PRRT (64.4 vs 55.8 months). The median follow up was 72.5 months. Frizziero comments that 'this trial once again shows that PRRT is an effective treatment for patients with pancreatic NETs , offering superior mediumterm survival and improved tolerability compared to oral targeted therapy, reinforcing Fndings from COMPETE, including that the addition of an SSA to PRRT may not be necessary. However, OS was numerically higher for sunitinib, with approximately half of the patients in each group crossing over, suggesting that the timing of PRRT may not impact long-term survival as much as it may do on PFS. Notably, the higher probability of response, with an impressive response rate of approximately 60%, supports prioritising PRRT where rapid tumour debulking is required.'

The beneFt of adding SSA to oral targeted agents for well-differentiated GEP-NETs is still matter of debate. Earlier this year, Fndings from the phase III JCOG1901/STARTER-NET trial showed that Frst-line combination of the SSA lanreotide plus everolimus led to a signiFcant improvement in PFS compared to everolimus monotherapy in patients with unresectable or recurrent GET-NETs (J Clin Oncol 2025, 652652). The results of the interim analysis conducted in 145 patients were presented at the 2025 ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. The median PFS was 11.5 months in the everolimus arm and 29.7 months in the combination therapy arm [HR 0.38; 99.91% CI 0.15-0.96; p = 0.00017]. The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 8.7% (6/69) and 87.0% (60/69) in the everolimus arm and 26.8% (19/71) and 91.5% (65/71) in the everolimus plus lanreotide arm, respectively. 'The combination induced responses in approximately one-quarter of patients, providing a compelling argument for its use as upfront treatment in patients where tumour debulking is the priority (e.g. high disease or symptom burden) and chemotherapy or PRRT is contraindicated', notes Frizziero. 'Although this is a positive study, the tolerability of the combination therapy is concerning, with nearly 40% of patients experiencing severe toxicities . This is an important aspect to take into account in treatment selection, particularly for long-term therapy in a palliative setting, and especially if longer follow-up conFrms no OS beneFt. Such Fndings may deter clinicians favouring PRRT over everolimus in both PFS and tolerability especially given the outcomes of the COMPETE trial. Another important consideration is that this study was conducted in an Asian population and, hence, the Fndings require validation in other ethnic groups.'

## The %elds of metastatic pancreatic NETs and advanced and low proliferative grade 3 disease tumours move forward

Data presented at the ESMO Congress 2024 (Barcelona, 13-17 September) demonstrated the potential of three novel antiangiogenic agents for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Results from a phase IIa, single-arm study showed a superior tolerability and safety proNle of an oral anti-vasculogenic mimicry agent , CVM-1118, compared with current targeted therapies in 43 patients with advanced NETs who had progressed on prior standard of care (Abstract 1145MO). With a median follow up of 12.8 months and, on average, three prior therapies, patients achieved median progression-free survival (PFS) of 10.5 months (95% conNdence interval [CI] 5.6-22.4 months), which was longer than the 4-6 months for placebo groups reported in phase III trials of sunitinib (N Engl J Med. 2011;364:501-513) and everolimus (N Engl J Med. 2011;364:514-523). A subgroup analysis of CVM-1118 with concurrent somatostatin analogue showed a median PFS of 22.4 months.

Commenting on the study results, Dr Louis de Mestier from the University Paris-Cité, France, says, 'The results must be interpreted with caution as patients with early progression in the study could have received concurrent somatostatin analogues, so the PFS of over 2 years in the combination treatment subgroup may have positively inauenced the PFS of the whole cohort. However, these results clearly warrant further exploration in controlled clinical trials.'

In a second phase II study, RamuNET , which assessed a combination of an antiangiogenic and alkylating agent , ramucirumab and dacarbazine, results showed it to be a promising new treatment option in patients with progressive, well-differentiated, pre-treated metastatic pancreatic NETs (grades1-3) (Abstract 1147MO). Out of a total of 45 patients, the disease control rate (DCR) after 6 months was 71.1%. During the Nrst 6 months, nine patients had progressive disease and four terminated treatment early due to adverse events. 'There are already some signals that this type of combination is a promising strategy in patients with advanced pancreatic NETs, for example streptozotocin plus bevacizumab (Eur J Cancer. 2014;50:3098-3106),' says de Mestier commenting on the data presented. 'However, as there was no control arm in the study, it is difcult to ascertain whether the combination could lead to an additional or synergistic effect.'

The uncertain signiNcance of outcomes from an interim analysis of the CABONEN prospective, singlearm, multicentre phase II trial, which was also presented at the Congress, are highlighted by de Mestier (Abstract 1146MO). The study investigated the efcacy and safety of cabozantinib in 32 patients with advanced, low proliferative grade 3 NETs with Ki67 up to 60%. 'The DCR after 6 months was 64.1%, and the median PFS was 6.7 months, which seems rather low in this population, possibly because the study included some patients with neuroendocrine carcinomas and 71% of patients were pre-treated,' he says. 'Although studies and populations are not comparable, subgroup analyses of the NETTER-2 trial showed median PFS of 22.2 and 5.6 months in patients with treatment-naïve advanced grade 3 NETs treated with Lu-DOTA-TATE plus octreotide or double-dose octreotide, respectively (Lancet. 2024;403:2807-2817).' Also, a total of 37 serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed, including three grade 5 events, highlighting that, 'tolerance to cabozantinib can be a problem.' 177

Regarding the design of these studies, de Mestier adds: 'All the studies that have been presented used the RECIST criteria to determine response , as is usually done; however, these criteria are not suitable for some antiangiogenic agents , as previously shown with sunitinib, and further criteria are required for clinical trials and routine practice.'

The ability to predict the eHcacy of agents is one of the most important gaps in relation to antiangiogenic-based therapy for NETs, and predictive biomarkers are crucial.

He concludes: 'To close current knowledge gaps, we need both plasma and imaging biomarkers, as well as reproducible and robust plasma assays for routine clinical practice. We also require comparative and strategy studies to identify which agents should be used and in which order, especially if resistance develops.'

Dr Strosberg on 212Pb-DOTAMTATE in Unresectable/Metastatic SSTR+ GEPNETs

Author(s): Jonathan R. Strosberg, MD

Jonathan Strosberg, MD, discusses safety data for 212Pb-DOTAMTATE in metastatic somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

Jonathan Strosberg, MD, professor, Moffitt Cancer Center, discusses findings from the phase 2 ALPHAMEDIX02 trial (NCT05153772) evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 212 Pb-DOTAMTATE in patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs).   1x 

This study included 2 cohorts: patients naive to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT; cohort 1; n = 36) and patients refractory to PRRT (cohort 2; n = 30). All patients needed to have histologically confirmed, unresectable or metastatic, SSTR-positive GEP-NETs with at least 1 site of measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Findings from cohort 1 presented at the 2024 ASCO Annual Meeting showed that evaluable patients not exposed to prior PRRT who received 212Pb-DOTAMTATE in the phase 1 ALPHAMEDIX01 trial (NCT03466216) or ALPHAMEDIX02 (n = 44) achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 56.8% (95% CI, 42.2%-70.3%), which Strosberg notes is higher than ORRs typically observed in prior clinical trials investigating lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (Lutathera) in this patient population. In the phase 2 portion (n = 36), the ORR was 55.6% (95% CI, 39.6%-70.5%).

Regarding safety, the targeted alpha therapy was generally tolerable, Strosberg explains. Notably, the incidences of hematologic and renal toxicities-common concerns with PRRT-were low for patients treated with 212PbDOTAMTATE, he continues. Any-grade alopecia was common, occurring in 93% of patients treated in phase 1 or 2 (n = 44), and Strosberg notes that this adverse effect (AE) was usually moderate and reversible. During the presentation at the ASCO Annual Meeting, he explained that SSTR is expressed on hair follicles.

One AE that has stood out with 212Pb-DOTAMTATE is dysphagia, Strosberg continues. In evaluable patients treated during ALPHAMEDIX02 (n = 36), the rate of any-grade dysphagia was 42%, and grade 3 or 4 dysphagia was reported in 1 patient (3%). Despite normal colonoscopy findings, esophageal manometry indicated results consistent with achalasia, according to Strosberg, who adds that this AE was generally managed with palliative treatments such as Botox injections.

## Summary

Background No randomised controlled trial has ever been done in patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas. Preclinical and first clinical evidence suggested beneficial e/uniFB00ects of sunitinib. We aimed to evaluate the safety and e/uniFB03cacy of sunitinib in patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

Methods FIRSTMAPPP is a multicentre, international, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase 2 trial done at 14 academic centres across four European countries. Eligible participants were adults (aged ≥18 years) with sporadic  or  inherited  progressive  metastatic  phaeochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas.  Patients  were  randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either oral sunitinib (37·5 mg per day) or placebo. Randomisation was stratified according to SDHB status (mutation present vs wild type) and number of previous systemic therapies (0 vs ≥1). Primary endpoint was the rate of progression-free survival at 12 months according to real-time central review (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1). On the basis of a two-step Simon model, we aimed for the accrual of 78 patients, assuming a 20% improvement of the 12-month progression-free survival rate from 20% to 40%, to conclude that sunitinib is e/uniFB00ective. Crossover from the placebo group was allowed. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01371201, and is closed for enrolment.

Findings From Dec 1, 2011, to Jan 31, 2019, a total of 78 patients with progressive metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas were enrolled (39 patients per group). 25 (32%) of 78 patients had germline SDHx variants and 54 (69%) had used previous therapies. The primary endpoint was met, with a 12-month progression-free survival in 14 of 39 patients (36% [90% CI 23-50]) in the sunitinib group. In the placebo group, the 12-month progression-free survival in seven of 39 patients was 19% (90% CI 11-31), validating the hypotheses of our study design. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were asthenia (seven [18%] of 39 and one [3%] of 39), hypertension (five [13%] and four [10%]), and back or bone pain (one [3%] and three [8%]) in the sunitinib and placebo groups, respectively. Three deaths occurred in the sunitinib group: these deaths were due to respiratory insu/uniFB03ciency, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and rectal bleeding. Only the latter event was considered drug related. Two deaths occurred in the placebo group due to aspiration pneumonia and septic shock.

Interpretation This first randomised trial supports the use of sunitinib as the medical option with the highest level of evidence for anti-tumour e/uniFB03cacy in progressive metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

## Introduction

Malignant  phaeochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas are ultra-rare cancers, with an annual incidence of less than one per million, and are defined by the presence of distant  metastases. 1,2 Main  characteristics  of  metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas include inherited  diseases  in  up  to  50%  of  cases,  including germline SDHB variants that have prognostic impact, 1,3-5

hormone-related hypertension in up to 80%, and bone metastases  in  up  to  70%  of  cases. 5,6 As  metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas are indolent in some cases, the decision to initiate systemic treatment is mainly based on the presence of uncontrolled hormone secretion or docu  mented tumour progression. 1

So far,  no  randomised  controlled  trial  in  patients  with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas has

## Research in context

## Evidence before this study

With an annual incidence of less than one per million, metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas are ultra-rare cancer entities. Clinical outcome is heterogeneous and some tumours come with an indolent biological behaviour, whereas some patients die rapidly following progressive disease. Because of the rarity of the disease, prospective clinical trials are scarce. At the time of when this trial was designed (2007-08), the optimal management of patients with progressive metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas remained undefined, with no approved systemic therapy up to now. A group of experts (FIRSTMAPPP Scientific Board) did a comprehensive literature search using PubMed with search dates between Jan 1, 1990, and Dec 31, 2007. The search terms used were 'metastatic pheochromocytoma', 'metastatic paraganglioma', 'therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'sunitinib', 'MIBG', or 'radionuclide therapy' with no language restrictions. This search was updated during preparation of the European Society of Medical Oncology Clinical Guidelines for adrenocortical carcinoma and malignant phaeochromocytoma in May, 2019, and in February, 2023. No randomised controlled trial and only ten prospective studies (with a total number of 311 enrolled patients) and 17 retrospective studies (with 466 patients) have been published. Most studies report on radiolabelled ligand therapy, dacarbazine-based cytotoxic chemotherapy, or multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Complete responses were reported extremely rarely, and partial responses were documented in most studies in less than 25% of patients. At the time of initiating this trial, preclinical data as well as first case series suggested efficacy of been  published.  Meta-iodobenzylguanidine  therapy  and dacarbazine-based  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  constitute  the two main historical options in guidelines. 1 In two phase 2 trials investigating low-specific or high-specific  metaiodobenzylguanidine activity  therapy  in  selected  patients with metastatic  phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas, partial response rates were 23% and 27% per study. 7,8 Only one  old  prospective  and  few  retrospective  studies  are available for cytotoxic chemotherapy, mainly dacarbazine based,  reporting  partial  response  rates  ranging  from 25% to 45%. 1,9-14

Sunitinib  is  a  multi-targeted  receptor  tyrosine  kinase inhibitor  (TKI)  directed  against  VEGFR,  PDGFR,  and RET. In 2008, a group of experts selected sunitinib as the choice of drug to be investigated in patients with metastatic  phaeochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas based on the following observations: the high frequency of SDHx gene  alterations  in  these  patients  leading  to HIF-2α stabilisation and consecutive activation of downstream targets such as VEGF and PDGF and their receptors; 15 the anti-tumour e/uniFB00ect of anti-VEGF antibodies in experimental meta  static  phaeochromocytoma  and paraganglioma  models; 16 positive  results  obtained  with sunitinib by targeting the highly vascularised metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas. These data formed the basis of the study protocol by the FIRSTMAPPP scientific board together with expert centres of the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors.

## Added value of this study

Despite the rarity of metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas, we were able to recruit the required number of patients with documented progressive disease for this first ever randomised controlled trial in this tumour entity. The FIRSTMAPPP trial shows the feasibility but also the prerequisites and conditions required to complete a randomised phase 2 trial, including close collaboration of all expert centres in one continent. Thus, this study provides the best achievable level of evidence in this ultra-rare cancer. Thereby, sunitinib becomes the best validated standard in patients with progressive metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas. In addition, higher response rate observed in patients with pathogenic germline SDHB variant constitute the first steps towards a personalised approach in this patient cohort than in those without the SDHB mutation.

## Implications of all the available evidence

Our study has immediate impact for the treatment of patients with progressive metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas, as we show for the first time in a randomised controlled trial that sunitinib is effective in this difficult-to-treat disease. In addition, sunitinib might now serve as a standard systemic therapy against which all other treatment options should be tested.

sunitinib in a phase 3 trial on pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours; 17 as  well  as  first  objective  responses  seen  in patients with advanced metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas treated with sunitinib. 18 At the same time, in the absence of robust prospective data, a placebo was chosen as the best control group by the same group of experts.

In  this  first  randomised  controlled  trial  ever  done  in patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas,  we  aimed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and e/uniFB03cacy of sunitinib in patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

## Methods

## Study design and participants

The  FIRSTMAPPP  study  is  an  academic,  multicentre, international,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  doubleblind, phase 2 trial. A total of 14 academic centres across four European countries were involved (Villejuif, Strasbourg, Angers, Lyon, Paris, Bordeaux, and Marseille [France];  Würzburg,  München,  and  Berlin  [Germany]; Brescia, Veneto, and Napoli [Italy]; and Nijmegen [Netherlands]; appendix pp 118).

Eligible participants met the following inclusion criteria:  aged  18  years  or  older,  sporadic  or  inherited metastatic  phaeochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas, pretreated  or  not,  an  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology Group  status  of  0-2,  Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumours  version  1.1  (RECIST  1.1)  measurable targets,  and  documented  progressive  disease  within 18  months  according  to  RECIST  1.1.  Adequate  liver, renal,  and  cardiac  functions  (including  home  blood pressure  monitoring)  were  required.  Main  exclusion criteria  were  uncontrolled  hypertension,  cardiovascular events  within  the  previous  12  months,  previous  use  of VEGF  inhibitors,  and  uncontrolled  brain  metastasis. Additional eligibility criteria are available in the protocol (appendix pp 8-117).

All  patients  provided  written  informed  consent.  This study was done in accordance with the protocol (appendix pp 8-117), and conformed to the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the Declaration of Helsinki. All ethics committees (Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile de France VIII, Ethik-Kommission des Landes Berlin, Ethik-Kommission des Klinikums der Universität München, Ethik-Kommission der Universität Würzburg, METC  Oost-Nederland,  Comitato  Etico  Istituto  Oncologico  Veneto,  Comitato  Etico  dell'AO  Spedali  Civili  di Brescia,  and  Comitato  Etico  per  le  attività  biomediche Università Federico II di Napoli) and national authorities approved this study. The FIRSTMAPPP  trial was designed  under  the  auspices  of  the  FIRSTMAPPP Scientific Board and European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors. Data were monitored onsite.

## Randomisation and masking

Patients  were  randomly  assigned  (1:1)  to  either  the sunitinib  group  or  placebo  group.  Randomisation  was done by minimisation with a random component of 20% using  the  web-based  system  TENALEA  (version  2.2). Randomi  sation  was  stratified  according  to  the SDHB mutation status (mutation present vs wild type) and the number of previous systemic therapies (0 vs ≥1), and was done centrally at the Biostatistics Unit of Gustave Roussy (Villejuif,  France).  Participants  and  investigators  were masked to group assignment.

## Procedures

Participants received either 37·5 mg sunitinib or placebo capsules of similar appearance  once  per day in a continuous oral intake. The dose of sunitinib could be reduced to 25 mg or 12·5 mg per day in case of adverse events. Intra-patient re-escalation was allowed as well as dose escalation to 50 mg per day in participants without tumour  response  by  RECIST  and  experiencing  no  or only  minor  adverse  events.  Treatment  was  maintained until RECIST 1.1 documented progression, unacceptable adverse  events,  or  death.  Crossover  was  allowed  for patients randomly assigned to the placebo group at the time of confirmed disease progression.

Clinical and biomarker data were collected once a week in the first 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks until week 12, and thereafter  every  12  weeks.  Patients  underwent  a  neck, chest,  abdomen,  and  pelvic  CT  or  MRI  scan,  with contrast, at baseline and every 12 weeks during the study. Real-time blinded central review was done according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. In addition, ¹⁸[F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([¹⁸F]FDG)-PET  (or the most  informative  diagnostic functional imaging according to the protocol) was done every 12 weeks.

Vital signs, blood pressure, heart function, and pain-related symptoms were ascertained according to procedures defined in the study protocol (appendix pp 8-117).

An independent data medical committee was set up to control  for  safety,  including  compatibility  of  hormone and  drug-related hypertension, and  enrolment  rate. Four  independent  data  medical  committee  meetings over 10 years recommended the continuation of the trial without any change in the protocol.

## Outcomes

The primary endpoint was the progression-free survival rate at 12 months associated with sunitinib based on realtime central RECIST 1.1 evaluation.

Secondary  endpoints  were  progression-free  survival defined as the time from randomisation to first documentation  of  objective  tumour  progression  or  to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first; overall survival  defined  as  the  time  from  randomisation  to death due to any cause; objective response rate defined as  complete response plus partial response rates; and duration of response, defined as the time from the first documentation of overall response (complete response or partial response) that is subsequently confirmed, to the first tumour progression or death due to any cause. Safety was evaluated continuously, and the severity of adverse events were assessed by the investigator according  to  the  National  Cancer  Institute  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0).

The  assessment  of  the  quality  of  life  was  part  of  an exploratory analysis based on the European Organization for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer,  quality-of-life Questionnaire  (EORTC  QLQ-C30  [version  3])  that  was collected at baseline and then every 3 months. Patients rated  pain  severity  using  the  Visual  Analog  Bone  Pain Scale at baseline and at 3, 12, and 24 months.

In addition, predefined analyses were done for potential relationships between clinical parameters, previous  therapies,  adverse  events,  and  cancer-related outcomes.

Prespecified exploratory analyses were planned and will be reported in dedicated studies  focusing  on  blood pressure  control,  roles  of  hormone-related  biomarkers, and ([¹⁸F]FDG)-PET as surrogates of tumour response as well  as  tissue-related  biomarkers  depending  on  tissue availability.

## Statistical analysis

This study was designed as a randomised, noncomparative, placebo-controlled trial. The primary endpoint  (12-month  progression-free  survival  rate)  was assessed on the intention-to-treat population and based upon central imaging review. The basic assumption was a 20% improvement from 20% to 40% of the 12-month progression-free  survival  rate.  The  analysis  was  done according to the Simon  two-step design 19 with an alpha of 10% and power of 90%. Consequently, 39 patients were required in each group for a total of 78 patients.

The first analysis (ie, first step) was planned 12 months after the inclusion of 34 patients, 17 in each group. If less than  four  patients  of  the  sunitinib  group  showed  no progression of disease at 12 months, the trial would have been  stopped  for  futility.  The  final  analysis  (ie,  second step) was obtained for all the 78 patients. If 11 or more patients  showed  no  disease progression  at  12  months, then sunitinib would be considered e/uniFB00ective according to the Simon design.

The placebo group served for validation of the hypothesis  that  without  active  treatment  the  12-month progression-free survival is 20% (within the 90% CI) to confirm the Simon design conclusion. The 20% 12-month progression-free survival rate hypothesis takes into account the request for a documented progression within 18 months before enrolment.

Progression-free  survival  and  overall  survival  were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and presented with Rothman 95% CI. Median follow-up was estimated by  reverse  Kaplan-Meier  method.  As  an  exploratory analysis,  we  used  Cox  proportional-hazards  models  to test the treatment e/uniFB00ect within di/uniFB00erent subgroups. The models used were adjusted by the subgroups analysed.

The QLQ-C30 questionnaire was interpreted as proportions of patients with a deterioration in QLQ-C30 scores (≥10-point decrease or increase for quality of life or  symptoms  scale)  on  di/uniFB00erent  subscales. 20 A  Visual Analog  Bone  Pain  Scale  was  applied  for  evaluation  of bone pain severity ratings and deterioration was interpreted as a 2-point increase. 21

We did all statistical  analyses  with  SAS  (version  6.4). This  trial  is  registered  with  ClinicalTrials.gov,  number NCT01371201, and closed for enrolment.

## Role of the funding source

The funders  of  the  study  had  no  role  in  study  design, data  collection,  data  analysis,  data  interpretation,  or writing of the report. The private donator had no role in data  analysis,  data  interpretation,  and  writing  of  the report.

## Results

From Dec 1, 2011, to Jan 31, 2019, a total of 78 patients with  progressive  metastatic  phaeochromocytomas  and paragangliomas  were  randomly  assigned  to  a  study group (39 patients per group). In total, the median age

was 54 years (IQR 46-63), and 32 (41%) of 78 were women and  46  (59%)  were  men.  Main  tumour  characteristics were  well balanced  between  both  groups  (table  1). Previous treatments were given in 54 (69%) of 78 patients, including systemic therapy (ie, meta-iodobenzylguanidine, chemotherapy, everolimus, somatostatin analogues,  interferon,  or  peptide  receptor  radionuclide therapy) in 22 (56%) of 39 patients in the sunitinib group and 25 (64%) of 39 in the placebo group.

Patients  received  sunitinib  for  a  median  duration  of 12 months (IQR 4-18) or placebo for a median duration of 4  months  (IQR  3-9).  The  most  common  reasons  for treatment  discontinuation  were  tumour  progression  in 24 (62%) of 39 patients in the sunitinib group and 32 (82%) of 39 patients in the placebo group, or adverse events in five (13%) patients in the sunitinib group (figure 1).

Dose interruption was reported in 27 (69%) of 39 in the sunitinib group and six (15%) of 39 in the placebo group. At least one dose reduction to 25 mg per day was reported in  17  (44%)  of  39  patients  in  the  sunitinib  group  and one (3%) of 39 in the placebo group. No dose escalation was reported.

Regarding the primary endpoint in the sunitinib group at the first-step analysis at 12 months, after the inclusion of the first 17 patients, six (35%) of 17 were alive and free of progression; at the second-step analysis on the 39 patients, 14 patients (36% [90% CI 23-50]) showed no progression  of  disease  at  12  months  (table  2).  At  the second-step analysis, in the placebo group, seven patients (19% [90% CI 11-31]) showed no progression of disease  at  12  months.  As  20%  was  included  in  the 90% CI, the hypotheses of our design were validated and sunitinib was considered e/uniFB00ective.

In terms of the secondary endpoints, the median followup was 29·7 months (IQR 18·4-37·0). Median progression-free survival was 8·9 months (IQR 3·4-19·5) in the sunitinib group and 3·6 months (3·0-8·6) in the placebo group (figure 2A). At 24 months, the progressionfree survival rate was 17·6% in the sunitinib group and 8·4%  in  the  placebo  group  (table  2).  Of  note,  the progression-free  survival  rate  at  24  months  confirms previous tumour progression within 18 months in almost all patients. 27 (69%) of 39 patients in the placebo group crossed  over  and  received  sunitinib.  Median  overall survival of the entire population with metastatic phaeochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas  was  29·5  months (IQR  15·4-49·5)  and  was  not  significantly  di/uniFB00erent  in both  groups:  26·1  months  (IQR  16·8-36·9)  in  the sunitinib  group  and  49·5  months  (15·4-52·9)  in  the placebo group (figure 2B). The cause of death was related to  disease progression in 19 (79%) of 24 patients in the sunitinib group and 13 (81%) of 16 in the placebo group. No complete response was documented. Partial response rate  was  36·1%  (95%  CI  20·8-53·8)  in  the  sunitinib group and 8·3% (1·8-22·5) in the placebo group (table 2; figure 3). The median duration of response was 12·2 months (IQR 6·3-27·7) in the sunitinib group.

Data are n, median (95% CI), or response rate (95% CI). Table 2 shows data of the final second-step analysis. Please note that expression of the primary and secondary endpoint results in table 2 (95% CI time-to-event variable for the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints for consistency) differs from the main text (90% CI binary variable for the primary and IQR expression for some secondary endpoints). Objective tumour response was evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1). Progression-free survival and overall survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimation and their CIs were estimated with Rothman's method. Clopper-Pearson method was used for CIs of objective tumour and best-observed responses. *Best response according to RECIST 1.1 was not available for six (8%) of 78 patients. These six patients did not have any radiological evaluation available because of death (n=4) or lost to follow-up (n=2) before their first evaluation. †As an intention-to-treat analysis, one (3%) of 39 patients treated with sunitinib at the time of partial response because of crossover was considered in the placebo group.

In some analysed subgroups ( SDHB -mutated subgroup  and  patients  with  arterial  hypertension  at baseline) of the exploratory analysis, the hazard ratio for progression or death favoured sunitinib compared with placebo (appendix p 2). Partial response rate was higher in  patients  with  germline SDHB variants,  previous systemic  anti-tumour  therapies,  or  with  a  history  of hypertension at baseline in the sunitinib group than in the placebo group (appendix p 3).

EORTC QLQ-C30 data were available for 75 (96%) of 78 patients. The proportion of patients without quality-oflife deterioration was higher in the placebo group than in the sunitinib group at 3 months (89% [95% CI 71-96] vs 73%  [55-85]),  but  comparable  at  12  months  (figure  3; appendix pp 4-5).

Pain  severity  ratings  were  available  for  all  patients. Probability  of  being  free  of  pain  was  higher  in  the sunitinib group than in the placebo group, and the largest proportional  di/uniFB00erence  was  at  2  years  in  the  sunitinib group compared with the placebo group (79% [95% CI 62-90] vs 42% [25-61]; (appendix pp 4-5).

Most adverse events in both groups were grade 1 or 2, and  occurred  in  both  groups  (table  3).  In  addition, 28  (72%)  of  39  patients  in  the  sunitinib  group  and 24  (62%)  of  39  patients  in  the  placebo  group  had grades  3-5  adverse  events  (table  3).  Overall,  the  most common  adverse events were asthenia, diarrhoea,

Ten patients (n=5 in the sunitinib group; n=5 in the placebo group) were not included in these figures: six patients did not have any radiological evaluation (four because of early death and two because of early lost to follow-up) and four patients' sum of target lesions could not be interpreted. Partial responses in the placebo group were related to sunitinib therapy in one patient with SDHB mutation classified in the placebo group based on intention-to-treat methodology and abdomen lymph node targets only in two patients. *Patient with SDHB mutation.

hypertension, vomiting, and nausea. The most frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events were asthenia (seven [18%] of 39 in the sunitinib group and one [3%] of 39 in the placebo group), hypertension (five [13%] in the sunitinib group and four [10%] in the placebo group), and back or bone pain (one [3%] in the sunitinib group and three [8%] in the placebo group). Three deaths occurred in the sunitinib group and were related to respiratory insu/uniFB03ciency,  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis  (diagnosed 1  year  after  the  end  of  treatment),  and  rectal  bleeding. This latter death  event occurred  in a patient with collateral venous circulation of a pelvic bone metastasis

Adverse events were defined using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). One death was considered as drug related in the sunitinib group due to rectal bleeding in a patient with hypervascularised pelvis bone metastases. No hypertensive crisis was reported as a cause of death. As an intentionto-treat analysis, patients who crossed over were considered in the group of their initial treatment. *Grade 5 events (n=3 in the sunitinib group; n=2 in the placebo group).

and was considered drug related. Two deaths occurred in the  placebo  group  due  to  aspiration  pneumonia  and septic shock. Six adverse events led to discontinuation of sunitinib  treatment  in  five  (14%)  of  35  patients  in  the sunitinib  group:  mouth  and  nose  bleeding  (grade  3), proteinuria  (grade  3),  hyperkalaemia  and  elevated  liver enzymes (grade 3), generalised weakness (grade 3), lower limb  ischaemia  (grade  3),  and  cognitive  deterioration (grade 2).

## Discussion

Ultra-rare  cancers  have  a  low  access  to  drug  innovation and a low level of evidence for recommendations because of the paucity of randomised  controlled  trials. 1 The FIRSTMAPPP trial is the first in the field of patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas and one of the very few randomised controlled trials in the field of ultra-rare cancers as recently defined by an annual incidence of less than one per million. 2 This study provides the highest level of evidence ever reached to support the anti-tumour role of a systemic treatment option in patients with aggressive metastatic  phaeochromocytomas  and paragangliomas,  and  supports  sunitinib  as  a  potential candidate for first-line therapy. The best feasible methodology was applied including a placebo-controlled, double-blind  randomised  trial  design,  as  done  in  most endocrine  and  neuroendocrine  phase  3  trials,  real-time central RECIST evaluation, and independent data medical committee  control.  Selection  of  sunitinib  and  placebo, inclusion criteria, and surveillance of patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas were  achieved  through  an  expert  consensus  and  were based  on  data  available  at  the  time  of  trial  initiation. Finally, complete accrual was achieved as well as consistent evaluation over a 7-year period despite unique challenges related to comorbid hormone-related symptoms, indolent

courses,  or  isolated  bone  metastases  of  subgroups  of patients, which challenged the enrol  ment rate. As compared  with  previously  mentioned  characteristics  of the population with metastatic phaeo  chromocytomas and paragangliomas, 5,6 the 32% SDHB germline mutation rate as well as the absence of other germline-mutated patients are remarkable.

The  primary  endpoint  of  the  FIRSTMAPPP  trial  was met. Sunitinib is therefore e/uniFB00ective and becomes the best validated  therapeutic  option  in  progressive  metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas. This finding is  further  supported by several secondary endpoints. In addition, the quality of life was maintained and intensity of  bone  pain  decreased.  Importantly,  sunitinib  adverse events  were  manageable.  Overall  survival,  as  shown  by the  large  overlapped  CIs,  was  similar  in  both  groups, which is likely to be a/uniFB00ected by the crossover achieved in 69%  of  patients  in  the  placebo  group,  the  prolonged median  overall survival of patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas allowing numerous  lines  of  treatments,  and  the  low  number  of patients studied.

More than 10 years after the inclusion of the first patient in  the  FIRSTMAPPP  trial,  the  therapeutic  options  have changed for metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas. In addition to the two historical medical options, meta-iodobenzylguanidine and dacarbazinebased chemotherapy, retrospective studies have suggested an  anti-tumour  activity  of  peptide  receptor  radionuclide therapy  in  somatostatin  receptor-positive  patients,  based on partial response rates of 6-29% and median progression-free survival of 13-39 months. 22-24 Also, progress has been made in the field of metaiodobenzylguanidine therapy, with a recently published phase 2 trial in patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas, using optimised high-specific meta-iodobenzylguanidine activity, which  has  reported  a  partial  response  rate  of  23%. 7 In addition,  our  group  reported  a  partial  response  of  33% with  temozolomide  alone,  suggesting  that  the  historical cyclophosphamide-vincristine-dacarbazine chemotherapy combination could be challenged. 22-24 Finally, two  prospective  phase  2  trials  with  TKI  targeting  VEGF receptors,  showed  partial  responses  in  13-45%  of  cases and median progression-free survival of 4-11 months, 25,26 thus supporting our results.

Major  heterogeneity  in  the  prognosis  of  metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas precludes comparisons  between  survival  endpoints  across  trials even when  prospective. Indeed, we  have previously reported progression-free survival of more than 1 year in 46% of patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas  in  whom  watch-and-see  policy  was  the first-line  strategy. 27 By  contrast,  the  median  progressionfree survival of 3·6 months and median overall survival of 29·4 months in the placebo group confirms that patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas enrolled in FIRSTMAPPP  had  aggressive tumours. Prognosis heterogeneity of metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas makes standardised  tumour  progression  status  determination before  treatment  a  key  feature  of  trial  development  in patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas  as  done  in  FIRSTMAPPP.  As  the  first randomised controlled trial  in  the  field  of  patients  with metastatic  phaeochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas, FIRSTMAPPP  is  a  major  step  forward  to  supporting sunitinib  as  the  best  validated  treatment  option  and  a potential  candidate  for  first-line  therapy  in  progressive metastatic  phaeochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas. Indeed,  40%  of  patients  were  systemic  treatment  naive when enrolled in  FIRSTMAPPP. However, the placebocontrol  group  study  design  used  in  FIRSTMAPPPwhether it allows a proper evaluation of benefit-to-safety ratio and best demonstration of the changes in the natural history-does not allow the claim that sunitinib is superior to any other treatment option.

Grades  3-4  or  serious  adverse  events  were  previously reported with all systemic therapeutic options in patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas. 9-11,18,22-24 The  indolent  course  observed  in some patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas makes the selection of these patients to be treated  and  the  control  of  comorbid  conditions,  such  as hypertension and bone pain before treatment, both essential as anticipated in FIRSTMAPPP. In the two recent TKI  phase  2  trials,  using  sunitinib  50  mg  per  day  for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of observation or another TKI (pazopanib), grades 3-4 adverse events were reported in 23-66%, including hypertension exacerbation and Takotsubo syndrome. 25,26 Of note, both studies were stopped for slow enrolment. In the recent metaiodobenzylguanidine  phase  2  trial,  grade  3-4  adverse events-mainly haematological-were reported in 62%  of patients and up to 4%  of myelodysplastic syndrome has been reported with meta-iodobenzylguanidine therapy. 8,9 Although  adverse events in the FIRSTMAPPP trial might be in the same range comparable to previous prospective trials, these findings might explain the  transient  decrease  of  quality  of  life  at  3  months.  In addition,  TKI  with  the  highest  rate  of  cardiovascular adverse events 28 should be used with extreme caution in patients with metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas. However, no drug withdrawal was related to hypertension and hypertension-related grade 3-4 adverse  events  were  comparable  in  the  sunitinib  and placebo groups, which suggest that sunitinib 37·5 mg per day is a good compromise.

Personalised medicine is emerging in metastatic phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma therapy. 3 Subgroup  analysis  of  the  FIRSTMAPPP  trial  shows  a 50%  partial response rate in patients with SDHB mutations, the highest partial response rate reported in patients  with  a  neuroendocrine  tumour  treated  with

sunitinib, so far. This finding provides the first clinical validation available of the SDHB -related pseudo-hypoxic hypothesis. 15 In  addition,  patients  with  hypertension (who  represent  40%  of  the  entire  study  cohort)  were finally found to be good candidates for sunitinib treatment, but control of hypertension before treatment initiation is mandatory.

The present study has certain limitations. For instance, this study is a non-comparative randomised phase 2 trial and the alpha risk of the primary endpoint was set up at 0·1 to take into account the scarcity of the disease. Nevertheless, a  total  of  7  years  was  required  to  enrol  78  patients  in 14  expert  centres  across  four  countries  in  Europe.  Thus, although  a  properly  powered  randomised  phase  3  trial would be desirable, this option seems not to be reachable within  the  upcoming  years.  For  the  same  reason,  both pretreated  or  treatment-naive  patients  with  metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas were enrolled.

In  conclusion,  the  FIRSTMAPPP  trial  is  the  first randomised  study  achieved  in  the  field  of  metastatic phaeochromocytomas  and  paragangliomas.  Sunitinib becomes the drug with the highest level of evidence of anti-tumour activity in patients with progressive metastatic phaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas.

Among the 78 patients, 6 did not have any radiological evaluation. They are not included in this table.

Percentages are row percentages in each arm. For example, in the SDHB mutated subgroup, 50% patients in the sunitinib are partial responders whereas they are only 9.1% in the placebo arm.

EORTC QLQ-C30 was available in 37 patients in SUN arm and 38 patients in PLA arm. Quality of life deterioration is defined as time from randomization to the first date a patient experiences a 10-point decrease on the global health status scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 compared to baseline. Patients who did not experience this decrease are censored at their last questionnaire available.

Symptoms progressions (except bone pain) is defined as time from randomization to the first date a patient experiences a  10-point  increase  on  the  symptoms  scales  of  the  EORTC  QLQ-C30  compared  to  baseline.  Patients  who  did  not experience this increase are censored at their last questionnaire available. Here, only insomnia, fatigue constipation and diarrhea subscales are considered.

As an ITT analysis, patients who cross-over were considered in the arm of their initial treatment. This table represents the proportion of patients in each arm without quality of life deterioration at different time points. Proportions of being event free were estimated with their 95% confident intervals.

| Probability of being event-free at 2 years  | 79.1% [62.3 ; 89.6] | 42.2% [25.3 ; 61.2] |

A Visual Analog Bone Pain Scale (VAS) was available in all patients. Bone pain symptoms deterioration is defined as the time from randomization to the first date a patient experiences a 2-point increase of the visual analog bone pain scale compared to baseline. A Visual Analog Bone Pain Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure bone pain that is believed to range across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain. From the patient's perspective this spectrum appears continuous (their pain does not take discrete jumps, as a categorization of none, mild, moderate and severe would suggest). It was to capture this idea of an underlying continuum that the VAS was devised. Patients who did not experience this increase are censored at their last evaluation available. This table represents the proportion of patients in each arm without bone pain symptoms deterioration at different time points. Proportions of being event free were estimated with their 95% confident intervals.

Mean scores are represented for different subscales of the EORTC QLQC-30 questionnaires: quality of life, insomnia, fatigue, constipation and diarrhea. For quality of life scale, a score of 100 means a high quality of life However, for the symptom  subscales  (insomnia,  fatigue,  constipation  and  diarrhea)  a  score  close  to  100  represents  a  high  level  of symptomology. As an ITT analysis, patients who cross-over were considered in the arm of their initial treatment.

Tel.: 01 42 11 61 98 I NDICATION : Malignant PPGL

M ETHODOLOGY : Randomized, double-blind, phase II, international, multicenter study

## P RIMARY OBJECTIVE :

To  determine  the  efficacy  of  Sunitinib  on  the  progression-free  survival  at  12  months  in  subjects  with progressive malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma treated with sunitinib at a starting dose of

37.5 mg daily (continuous dosing).

## S ECONDARY OBJECTIVES :

- -To determine overall survival and progression free survival.

-

To determine time to progression.

## C) GENERAL INFORMATION ON STUDY (continued)

## I NCLUSION CRITERIA :

- -Diagnosis of malignant PPGL, based on imaging or biopsy evidence of metastases in liver, bones, lungs and or lymph nodes, combined with at least one of two further confirmatory diagnoses: 1. diagnosis of PPGL from histopathological  review  of  resected  or  biopsied  tissue  performed  by  a  skilled  pathologist (centralized review will be performed in all cases either before enrolment in case of any doubt or during the study); or 2. in patients where tumor tissue is unavailable for formal pathological review, from combined biochemical and functional imaging evidence of PPGL (e.g., MIBG scintigraphy combined with  consistently and highly elevated plasma or urine levels of metanephrines).
- -Metastatic disease not amenable to surgical resection
- -Pre-treated or not
- -Whatever the genetic status (sporadic or inherited)
- -Evaluable disease according to RECIST 1.1 criteria
- -Progressing  disease  within  18  months  at  imaging  prior  to  randomization  according  to  RECIST.  The recent scan indicating progression may be used as the screening scan if within 28 days of randomization
- -ECOG performance status 0-2
- -Life expectancy ≥ 6 months as prognosticated by the physician
- -Age ≥18 years, no superior limit
- -Adequate bone marrow reserve (Hb &gt; 8, neutrophils ≥ 1500/mm³ and platelets ≥80.000/mm³)
- -Effective contraception in pre-menopausal female and male patients
- -Negative pregnancy test
- -Patient´s signed written informed consent
- -Ability to comply with the protocol procedures

-

Ability to take oral medication

## C) GENERAL INFORMATION ON STUDY (continued)

## N ON INCLUSION CRITERIA :

History of prior malignancy, except for cured non-melanoma skin cancer, cured in situ cervical carcinoma, or other treated malignancies with no evidence of disease for at least three years.

Severe renal (GFR  &lt;30ml/mn or nephrotic syndrome)   or hepatic insufficiency (ALT / AST &gt; 2.5 x ULN or ALT/AST &gt;5 x ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to the underlying malignancy and/or total serum bilirubin &gt; 2.5 x ULN)

Patients with cardiac events within the previous 12 months, such as myocardial infarction (including severe/unstable angina pectoris), coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, revascularization procedure  symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF, ejection fraction &lt;45%), ), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, clinically significant bradycardia, cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attack, or pulmonary embolism

Hypertension that cannot be controlled despite medications (&gt;=160/95 mmHg despite optimal medical therapy)

Abnormal cardiac function with 12 lead ECG. Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTC grade ³ 2, atrial fibrillation of any grade, or prolongation of the QTc interval to &gt;470 msec for males or &gt;480 msec for females.

Brain metastases (exception if stable and asymptomatic for more than 3 months)

## Pregnancy or breast feeding

Previous treatment with the drug under study. Prior systemic treatment with any tyrosine kinase inhibitors  or anti-VEGF angiogenic inhibitors.

Current treatment with another investigational drug.

Treatment  with  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  and  inducers  within  7  and  12  days,  respectively  prior  to  study drug administration

Concomitant treatment with therapeutic doses of anticoagulants. Low dose warfarin (Coumadin â ) up to  2 mg PO daily for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is allowed as well as heparin-based anticoagulation

Prior treatments with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, somatostatine analog therapy drug , thoracic  radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to inclusion

Major surgery for any cause or local radiotherapy within one month prior to visit 1

Liver embolisation therapy within the last 3 months prior visit 1 except if progression is demonstrated and  embolised lesion not used as targets

Unrecovered toxicity from any kind of therapy

Active or suspected acute or chronic uncontrolled disease that would impart, in the judgment of the investigator, excess risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, or which, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study.

## P RIMARY AND SECONDARY EVALUATION CRITERIA :

## P RIMARY CRITERION :

Progression-free survival at 12 months.

Progression will be assessed by RECIST 1.1 performed every 3 months  (centralized imaging)

## S ECONDARY CRITERIA :

Objective Response Rates (ORR)

Duration of response (DR)

Overall Progression-free survival (PFS)

Overall Time to Progression (TTP)

Overall survival (OS)

Toxicity (NCI -CTC V4 criteria)

Cardiovascular tolerance assessed by specific organisation for blood pressure monitoring

## E XPLORATORY CRITERIA :

To determine the correlations between clinical parameters, biomarkers and OR, PFS and survival

To investigate the correlations between hormone complete or objective response to PET-FDG alteration  or conventional imaging perfusion or toxicity profile, and OR, PFS or overall survival

## D) DESCRIPTION OF STUDY TREATMENTS

Patients are randomized for sunitinib 37.5 mg per day versus Placebo

For the patients randomized in the Placebo, cross over is allowed if progression

T REATMENT DURATION : 24 months

## E) SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION

The primary objective is to estimate the PFS rate at 12 months associated with sunitinib. The 12-months PFS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and presented with Rothman's 95% Confidence Intervals. The control group will be used as an internal control group.

The optimal two-stage design [Simon, Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1-10 1989] has been adopted (α =10%, power = 90%). We assume a gain of 20%, from 20% to 40% of PFS at 12 months with sunitinib. In the first stage: 34 patients will be randomized, 17 in each group. If 4 or more pts are alive without progression at 12 months in the sunitinib group, 40 additional patients minimum will be randomized for a total of 78 patients, including at least 37 patients in Sunitinib arm. Else the study will be discontinued.

The accrual will not be stopped between the inclusion of the 34th patient and the first step analysis.

## F) DURATION OF STUDY

I NCLUSION PERIOD : 78 months (6.5 years)

T REATMENT PERIOD

: 24 months

F OLLOW - UP PERIOD :

## INTRODUCTION AND RATIONAL OF THE STUDY

## Background

Malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) arise respectively from the chromaffin cells of the  adrenal medulla (80 to 90%) and paraganglia of the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system, the latter including the organ of Zuckerkandl and the carotid body (DeLellis RA et al. IARC Press, 2004). These tumors belong within the larger family of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and as such are defined by an endocrine tumor morphotype at optic microscopy and positive  immunohistochemical  staining  for  chromogranin  A  and  synaptophysin  antigens.  Negative  staining  for keratins allows their differential diagnosis from endodemal -derived NETs (Gastroenteropancreatic NETs) (Tischler AS Arch Pathol Lab Med 2008, DeLellis RA WHO 2004, Baudin E Nature CPEM 2007).

Prevalence of PPGLs is estimated between 1:6,500 to 1:2,500 (Bravo et al, 2003, Lenders JW et al. Lancet 2005, Pacak K et al. 2006, Chrisoulidou A et al., 2007). Malignant PPGLs are defined by the presence of metastases at sites where chromaffin cells are normally absent (i.e., liver, lungs, bones, lymph nodes). Among PPGLs, malignant tumours have a frequency of about 14% (1:65,000 to 1: 25,000) (Orchard T et al; Surgery 1993, John et al Urology 1999, Goldstein RE et al. 1999, Amar L  et al JCO 2005, Khorram-Manesh et al. 2005), but are more frequent in patients with  SDHB  mutations or those who present with large primary tumors particularly at extraadrenal locations; in such cases the frequency of malignancy can reach 50% or more (Niemann S et al. 2003, Amar L et al JCO 2005, Brouwers JCEM 2006, Benn DE et al. JCEM 2006, Boedeker CC et al. 2007, Goldstein RE et al. 1999, Mannelli M et al. EJE 1999, John H et al 1999).

PPGLs are characterized by production of catecholamines, usually associated with hypertension and other  signs  and symptoms  of  catecholamine  excess  (Bravo  et  al,  2003,  Lenders  JW  et  al.  Lancet  2005,  Pacak  K  et  al.  2006, Chrisoulidou  A  et  al.,  2007).  The  catecholamines  are  secreted  in  variable  amounts  and  mixtures  of  dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline leading to highly heterogeneous signs and symptoms (e.g., paroxysmal or sustained hypertension, sweatiness, headaches, palpitations,  constipation) and complications if uncontrolled (e.g., cardiomyopathy, diabetes, shock). Patterns of hormonal secretion may also vary widely from continuous to episodic, so that catecholamine levels may fluctuate widely; in at least 14% of patients secretion is negligible so that plasma or urine catecholamines remain normal, failing to reveal disease (Eisenhofer et  al., 1999; Lenders et al., 2002). In contrast metabolism of the catecholamines to the O-methylated metabolites - including methoxytyramine, normetanephrine and metanephrine - occurs continuously within tumor cells by a  process that is independent of variations in hormonal release (Eisenhofer et al., 1998). Consequently these metabolites provide sensitive diagnostic biomarkers that reflect tumor size (Eisenhofer et al., 2005) and may also be expected to correlate with tumor burden in malignant PPGLs.

Whether  the  O-methylated  metabolites  provide  useful  surrogate  markers  of  disease  progression  or  disease  free survival  in  malignant  PPGLs  has  not  been  determined.  However,  one  recent  report  of  a  single  SDHB  patient  with malignant PGG documented the value of measuring both plasma normetanephrine and methoxytyramine to assess therapeutic response (He et al.,  2009). Measurements of serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels are expected to provide improved  sensitivity,  mainly  in  isolated  cases  of  malignant  paraganglioma  characterized  by  absent  synthesis  of

catecholamines (Timmers et al., 2008). Most malignant PPGLs produce predominantly increases in noradrenaline and normetanephrine, reflecting the relatively high proportion originating from extra- adrenal chromaffin cells that do not produce  adrenaline  or  metanephrine  (Eisenhofer  et  al.,  2004).  Malignant  PPGLs  are  also  often  characterized  by increased production of dopamine, partly reflecting

higher risk of malignancy associated with SDHB mutations and extra-adrenal locations (Tippett HJ et  al. 1987, Plouin PF 1997, Nobels FR et al. JCEM 1997, Eisenhofer G et al. JCEM 1998,van der Harst  E et al. EJE 2002, Eisenhofer G et al. Clin Chem 2005, Grossman A et al. 2006, Amar L 2007, Lenders Clin Chem 1993, d'Herbomez M et al. 2007).

Upwards  of  30%  or  more  PPGLs  derive  from  germ-line  mutations  of  nine  tumour  susceptibility  genes identified to date (Neumann HP et al. 2002, Neuman HP et al. 2004, Amar L et al. 2005, Benn et al. 2006; Boedeker CC et al 2007, Gimenez Roqueplo AP et al. 2003, Bayley et al., 2010, Qin et al 2010, Burnichon et al 2010). Among these mutations, those affecting the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) gene, the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene and the rearranged during transfection  (RET)  gene  in  multiple  endocrine  neoplasia  type  2  (MEN  2)  are  the  most  well  established  causes  of hereditary PPGLs. Mutations affecting the B and D subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB SDHD)  represent two additional important causes of hereditary catecholamine-producing PPGLs, while mutations of the SDHC gene leads primarily  to  head  and  neck  paragangliomas  that  usually do  produce  significant  amounts  of  catecholamines.  More recently  mutations  of  genes  encoding  the  SDH  complex  assembly  factor  2,  transmembrane  protein  127  and  SDH subunit  A  (SDHA)  have  been  identified  as  other  causes  of  hereditary  PPGLs  (Bayley  et  al.,  2010,  Qin  et  al  2010, Burnichon et al  2010).  The  association  of  germline SDHB mutations with malignancy is well established. The high prevalence of SDHB mutations in malignant PPGLs (ranging from 30 to 50%) justifies screening for the mutation in all patients with PPGL-related metastases.

The diagnosis of malignant PPGL cannot be determined by histopathological analyses, but instead requires proof of metastatic spread to locations where chromaffin cells are normally absent (Bravo et al, 2003, Lenders JW et al. Lancet 2005, Pacak K et al. 2006, Chrisoulidou A et al., 2007, Amar L et al JCEM 2007, Timmers H JCO 2007). The usual sites of metastatic involvement include the lymph nodes (70%), liver (46%), lungs (30%) and bones (69%). Approximately 10% of PPGLs express only  bone metastases and should therefore not be considered as RECIST assessable. Bone pain and bone  related  compression  or  fractures  constitute  bone  metastases-related  features  which  should be  precisely analyzed prior to all therapeutic procedures. Bone marrow reserves should be preserved as long as possible using all types of bone marrow-sparing locoregional therapy.

Since malignancy cannot be determined from histopathological analysis of a resected primary tumor, imaging evidence of metastatic involvement usually constitutes the primary evidence of malignant disease. Such studies may include both conventional and functioning imaging at diagnosis or during follow-up, and require whole body imaging to search for liver, lung, bone and lymph  node metastases. CT examinations have a high sensitivity of about 90% for detecting primary tumors and metastatic and extra-adrenal lesions above 1cm in diameter. The underlying hypervascularity of the  primary  tumor  and  metastases  result  in  homogeneous  and  intense  enhancements  following  intravenous administration of contrast material. In some patients liver MRI may be more informative and  thus  chosen  for  followup  as  well  as  for  the  bone  marrow  evaluation  (Dromain  C  et  al.  JCO  2005, Leboulleux S et al JCEM 2007).

Metastatic  lesions  should  be  screened  for  using  both  conventional  and  functioning  imaging.  Functional  imaging approaches include 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, somatostatin receptor scintography (SRS) and positron emission tomography  (PET) using a variety of  ligands including 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucise (FDG), 18 Ffluorodihydroxyphenylalanine and 18 F- fluorodopamine (Duet M et al 2003, Hogerle S 2007, Ilias I et al. JCEM 2003, Ilias I et al. JCEM 2004, Mamede M et al 2006, Miskulin L et al 2003, Muros MA et al. 1998; Mundschenk J et al. JCEM 2003, Pacak K et al. 2004, Pacak K et al. JCEM 2001). Among these approaches, MIBG scintigraphy and FDG PET are the most widely available and thus the most suitable for routine use.

In patients with established malignancy, conventional imaging is considered the standard for tumor monitoring and evaluating therapeutic response. Conventional imaging is performed every three to 12 months according to tumor aggressiveness and results of biological markers when positive at diagnosis. Due to considerable heterogeneity in the natural  history  of  malignant  PPGLs,  demonstration  of  progressive  disease  is  a  prerequisite  for  initiating  medical interventions in asymptomatic patients (Amar L et al JCEM 2005, 2007).

Whereas MIBG scintigraphy offers higher diagnostic specificity than FDG PET, the latter imaging modality provides higher diagnostic sensitivity, particularly for detection of undifferentiated metastatic lesions in patients with SDHB mutations. The high frequency of bone metastases in these patients also argues in favor of the systematic use of functional imaging for therapeutic response evaluation in such patients (Timmers HJ 2007, 2009, MacKenzie IS 2007, Menzel C et al 2003). Thus, in addition to FDG PET, MIBG scintigraphy and/or SRS are perfomed in all patients to evaluate the potential role for therapeutic response evaluation; MIBG is particularly useful for specific identification PPGL-derived metastatic lesion at initial diagnosis. All foci of uptake will be correlated through conventional imaging findings.

Prognosis of malignant PPGLs is dependant on SDHB mutation status: the median survival is 42 months in patients positive for the mutation, but 244 months when negative (Amar et al. JCEM 2007). Again this underlies the wide ranging heterogeneity in the natural history of these tumors. Consequently, only patients with aggressive tumors defined by progressive disease according to RECIST criteria over the preceding 1.5 years will be enrolled in this study.

Treatment of malignant pheochomocytoma and paraganglioma

As reviewed elsewhere (Eisenhofer et al., 2004; Scholz T et al., 2007; Chrisoulidou et al., 2008; Eisenhofer et al., 2008; Fassnacht et al., 2009; Adjallé et al., 2009), treatment of malignant PPGLs has two main goals: 1. control of hormonerelated symptoms and 2. relief of tumor-related symptoms and burden. The benefit-toxicity ratio is closely evaluated with respect to the natural history of the disease and current absence of curative therapies.

Cardiac toxicity and severe hypertension are serious concerns in patients with PPGLs who frequently have baseline hypertension and can suffer chronic or acute cardiomyopathy consequent to catecholamine excess. Moreover, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) expose patients to cardiac, vascular and renal toxicity as a direct consequence of antagonism of VEGF-mediated influences on the cardiovascular system and kidneys. Therefore an in depth evaluation of both cardiac and renal function is mandatory at baseline. Furthermore, precise recommendations for cardiac and renal monitoring are followed as described in the annex 4. Control of hypertension involves use mainly of alpha-adrenoceptor blockers and calcium channel blockers with no interference with TKI. Of note, somatostatin analogue therapy is without any proven benefit in patients with PPGLs (Plouin PF et al. 2004). Control of constipation is another prerequesite before entry of patients into the study, since in cases with longstanding disease history it can negatively impact survival. Drugs allowed to control both conditions and contraindicated will be provided as appropriate (see annex 5). Preliminary experience from several centers suggests that TKI-related toxicity is manageable in PPGLs patients.

Surgery currently remains the single option for cure in patients with malignant PPGLs (Eisenhofer et al., 2004; Fassnacht et al., 2009). A careful evaluation should be made of all therapeutic options to ensure that toxicity does not outweigh expected gains in survival. For this reason and due to the absence of a curative option, a wait and see policy and rationalized follow-up are engaged in cases of a non-progressive metastatic disease where there are no expected risks of  loco  regional  complications.  When  a  loco  regional  risk  is  anticipated  (e.g.,  medullary  cord  compression,  risk  or fracture)  loco  regional  interventions  may  be  scheduled  (e.g.,  surgery,  radiotherapy,  embolization,  radiofrequency ablation,  cimentoplasty)  with  aims  of  minimizing  loco  regional  complications  and  in    cases  of  bone  metastases  of

preserving bone marrow function. Systemic therapy in most patients with progressive disease is usually considered. Uncontrolled  loco  regional  risk  and  symptoms-related  to  tumor  burden  or  hormone  excess  constitute  alternative settings in which medical systemic options may also be discussed. However, due to heterogeneity in the natural history of this disease, including spontaneous potential long term stabilization for years of even decades, only patients with progressive disease will be enrolled in this study.

Undoubtedly, 131I-MIBG therapy constitutes the most popular therapeutic option offered to patients with malignant PPGLs (Scholz T et al., 2007; Chrisoulidou et al., 2008; Fassnacht et al., 2009). Because of the similar structure to noradrenaline,  the  radiopharmaceutical  is  taken  up  into  PPGL  tumor  cells  by  a  highly  tissue  specific  membrane noradrenaline transporter, and then sequestered into vesicles where it is retained, exerting radiation-induced cell death. From the literature it can be concluded that approximately 50% of patients are eligible (based on uptake on diagnostic  scan).  Several  studies  have  been  published  on  the  efficacy  of  131I-MIBG  treatment  (including  a  single prospective study) that have included more than 10 patients (Safford SA 2003, Gedik G 2007, Gonias S 2007, Castellani MR 2010). Complete remissions were described, but were exceptional. Objective responses were observed in 22 to 47 % of cases and a median PFS above 12 months was reported. Objective responses were mainly observed in patients with soft tissue metastases with a prolonged PFS, but there was no demonstrated impact on survival. Grade 3-4 toxicity was  reported  in  16-83%  of  patients.  A  great  deal  of  caution  is  observed  in  cases  of  patients  with  multiple  bone metastases to avoid bone marrow toxicity; this may lead secondarily to a reduced number of therapeutic options that can be afforded to a given patient. Due to unknown status regarding tumor progression in these studies, no conclusion could be drawn from the rated stabilization observed in these studies. Symptomatic or hormonal responses have also been  reported  in  more  than  50%  of  patients.  Somatostatin  receptor  targeted  radiotherapy  may  constitute  an alternative  to  MIBG  therapy.  One  preliminary  study  reported  a  7%  objective  response  rate  with  a  64%  rate  of stabilization with bone metastases considered as a limitation for efficacy (Forrer et al. 2008).

Chemotherapy based on the Cyclophospamide-Vincristine-Dacarbazine (CVD) regimen has been the most frequently used therapy for malignant PPGLs. The preliminary rational for this  polychemotherapy came from CVD antitumor activity in patients with neuroblastoma, a tumor with similar embryological origins to PPGLs. Among the retrospective studies available, most are case reports, but two studies involved enrollment of more than 10 patients (Averbuch et al. 1983, Patel et al. 1995). In the first study by Averbuch et al., recently updated (Huang et al , 2008), the CVD regimen was carried out in 18 patients, establishing a 44% of objective partial response and an 11% complete responses over a 20-month follow-up period. Toxicity was reported to be acceptable. Comparable short-term objective response rates of 46% were published by Patel et al., who used a modified CVD regimen that included optional use of vincristine, but combined doxorubicin, in all  patients.  Although  the  survival  benefit  remains  unknown,  CVD  therapy  be  useful  for palliative care.

In addition to the scarcity of data, the second striking point regarding medical therapy in malignant PPGLs is the almost complete absence of published phase II or III trials. Indeed only one phase II trial has to date been published (Gonias S. et  al;  2007)  As  detailed  elsewhere  (Eisenhofer  et  al.,  2004),  this  fact  is  largely  explained  by  the  scarcity  and heterogeneity  of  this  tumor  making  involvement  of  expert  centers  and  international  networks  a  mandatory prerequisite in order to achieve both expertise and statistical power. As a consequence of European and US networks (i.e., ENSAT &amp; PRESSOR) established over the past 5 years, this prerequesite is now fulfilled; this study is therefore planned as the first trial that will provide the organizational structure for further trials for evidence- based therapeutic trials.

Success of the present trial can be foreseen based on a previous European and US experience in the setting of the randomized  FIRMACT  trial  in  AdrenoCortical  Carcinoma  (ACC,  1  per  million  incidence).  The  FIRMACT  study  was implemented based on academic structures and supported by national grants and one company's funding. FIRMACT enrolled more than 300 ACC patients within

a 5-year time frame.   This study is now closed for enrollment and has entered the follow-up phase and an abstract will be presented at the 13th European Congress of Endocrinology in May 2011. The FIRMACT Study establishes a proofof-concept example about how collaborative trials based on large consensus and a network of centers of excellence, such  as  the  ENSAT  network,  are  feasible  in  rare  cancers.  As  an  integral  component  of  an  ENSAT-based  research program, recently approved for funding under a European Union-based Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) award, there is now considerable a incentive spurring involvement and participation to guarantee success of the trial.

Angiogenesis and malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma

SDHB mutations are now recognized as the most powerful prognostic parameters for patients with malignant PPGLs (Amar L JCEM 2007). Activation of hypoxia-inducible target genes, including HIF 2 alpha, is a recognized feature of tumors from patients with SDHB mutations (Gimenez Roqueplo Am J Hum Genet 2001 , Cancer Res 2003, Favier J et al PNOS 2009). Inactivation of the mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase complex caused by SDH mutations increases intracellular succinate, which in turns impairs HIF prolyl hydroxylase, leading to HIF deregulation (Selak MA Cancer Cell 2005 7, 77-85). Furthermore, increased stability of HIF 2 alpha with downstream activation of angiogenesis pathways as  a  consequence  of  somatic  and  germline  mutations  of  the  VHL  gene  is  now  considered  a  putative  predictor  of response to anti-angiogenesis therapies in renal cell carcinoma (Patel Ph ASCO 2008, Motzer RJ et al. NEJM 2007, 356:115-24). Therefore inhibiting the effect of HIF 2 alpha activation-dependent targets has become an attractive therapeutic goal also for patients with malignant PPGLs. Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), but also other growth factors such as placental derived growth factor (PDGF), constitute major targets of HIF activation. VEGFs and VEGF receptors 1 and 2 are over expressed in malignant PPGLs (Favier J et al . Am J Pathol 2002, Salmenkivi et al. 2003, TAkekoshi 2004, Brieger et al 2005). Increased expression of hypoxia-angiogenic pathway components has also been reported in one gene expression study in malignant PPGLs (Brouwers ERc 2006) and is a common finding among PPGLs that produce mainly noradrenaline rather than adrenaline (Eisenhofer et al., 2004). In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested a role of VEGF as a mediator of angiogenesis in PC12 cells (Middeke M et al 2002) translating into neutralizing effect of anti-VEGF antibodies (Zielke A Surgery 2002) in experimental models.

Data on targeted molecular therapy are largely lacking in malignant PPGLs. Disappointing results with no response were reported in a series of four patients treated with everolimus (Druce MR Horm Metab res 2009) and two patients receiving imatinib (Gross D et al., ERC 2006). Objective responses were, however, observed in one out of three patients treated with the anti-angiogenic agent, thalidomide, combined with oral dacarbazine (Kulke M, 2006). Three recent case reports have been published reporting objective responses with manageable toxicity in 5 patients treated with Sunitinib and suffering from sporadic or inherited malignant PPGLs (Joshua AM, JCEM 2008, Jimenez C et al. JCEM 2008, Park KS et al Jpn J Clin Oncol 2009). Ongoing responses of at least 9, 24, 36, and 40 weeks were described in 4 patients. Progression at 24 months was reported in the last patient. Sunitinib is an oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity, which targets platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFR), VEGFR, KIT and FLT3.

Based on the preliminary results described above, further investigations of sunitinib in patients with a progressive malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma is warranted. This and current lack of validated therapeutic options

justifies the present randomized double blind phase II trial assessing Sunitinib efficacy with a control group receiving placebo.

Description of Investigational Medicinal Product: Sunitinib Malate

The investigational study drug is Sunitinib. Patients will receive either Sunitinib 37.5 mg daily or Placebo if randomized in the placebo arm. Sunitinib will be swallowed whole with a glass of water once daily at the same time each day in a fasting state.

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins containing extracellular ligand-binding domains and intracellular catalytic domains. RTKs are activated following binding of their cognate ligands and many of the processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and metastases are mediated by signaling molecules acting downstream from these proteins. Several members of the split-kinase domain family of RTKs are implicated in deregulated/ autocrine proliferation  and  survival  of  solid  and  hematologic  cancer  cells.  These  include  the  platelet-derived  growth  factor receptors (PDGFR GLYPH&lt;0&gt; and GLYPH&lt;0&gt; ); vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) Type 1 and 2 (FLT1 and FLK1/KDR); the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor, KIT, and the FLT3-ligand receptor. In addition, PDGFR and VEGFR are implicated in tumor-dependent angiogenesis.

Sunitinib malate is an orally administered small molecule that inhibits the tyrosine kinase enzymatic activities of the receptors for VEGF and PDGF, and also blocks signalling through the KIT, FLT3 and RET pathways. Therefore, sunitinib malate provides an opportunity for a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of subjects with malignant PPGLs. For further details refer to the sunitinib malate Investigator Brochure (IB).

## Molecular Formula and Chemical Name

Sunitinib is a small molecule with the molecular formula C 22 H 27 FN 4 O 2 . The free base has  a  molecular weight of 398.48 and the L-malate salt, the form used in clinical trials (Figure 1), has a molecular weight of 532.57. The chemical name of  the  L-malate  salt  is  (Z)N -[2-(Diethylamino)ethyl]-5-[(5-fluoro-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3 H -indol-3-ylidene)methyl]-2,4dime thyl-1 H -pyrrole-3-carboxamide (S)-2-hydroxysuccinate.

## Clinical Studies

## Pharmacokinetics

Single- and multiple-dose clinical pharmacokinetic studies of sunitinib over a range of 25 to 100 mg daily have been performed. Regimens have included either a repeated 4-week cycle comprising daily  treatment for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period (2/2 regimen) or a repeated 6-week cycle comprising daily treatment for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period (4/2 regimen). The Cmax and AUC of sunitinib increase in proportion to dose across the range of doses studied. No dose-dependent changes in Tmax or T1/2 have been observed. Sunitinib is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme, CYP3A4, to produce the active N-desethyl metabolite, SU012662. To  date,  no  other major metabolite has been identified. The terminal elimination half-life of sunitinib  and SU012662 are approximately 40 hours and 80 hours, respectively. Trough plasma drug concentrations plateau during the first 2 weeks of dosing. Accumulation across  multiple  cycles  of  treatment  has  not  been  observed.  Sunitinib  may  be  administered  without regard to meals.

## Scope of Clinical Program

To date, over 7000 patients with advanced malignancies have been treated with sunitinib. Multiple phase  1,  2  and  3 studies  have  been  conducted  or  are  underway.  The  majority  of  studies  have  administered sunitinib at the starting dose of 50 mg once per day for 4 weeks followed by a 2-week period off-drug, repeated at 6-week intervals (Schedule 4/2).

Preclinical investigations have indicated that total drug (sunitinib -parent drug + SU012662 -active metabolite) plasma concentrations of 50 ng/mL or greater are required to achieve inhibition of receptor phosphorylation. At the  50 mg daily dose, mean steady state plasma trough concentrations  of 80 ng/mL of total drug are achieved; pharmacokinetic modeling of a once daily 37.5 mg dose indicates that the steady state trough concentrations of total drug will be in the region of 60 ng/mL.

Several clinical studies investigating the safety and anti-tumor activity of sunitinib administered at a starting dose of 37.5 mg/day have been initiated. The protocols include the possibility of insertion of 6-week treatment breaks in the event of ³ grade 3 toxicity, with dose reduction to 25 mg daily at the discretion of the investigator for a recurring Grade 3 toxicity or for grade 4 toxicity. Patients experiencing minimal toxicity during 12 weeks of treatment may dose escalate to 50 mg/day at any subsequent time. The safety profile for sunitinib administered in the continuous regimen appears to  be  comparable to that for the currently registered regimen of 50 mg/day administered on Schedule  4/2.

The study having the longest continuous dose administration experience is a Phase II trial of single agent sunitinib in subjects having advanced, cytokine-refractory renal cell carcinoma (Study A6181061). A total of 107 subjects were enrolled and as of February 2007, have been on study for a median of 6.9 months (range 0.4-13.4).   Patients were randomized to a sunitinib dose of 37.5 mg once daily given in the AM (n=54) or PM (n=53). Based on tolerability,

individual  doses  were  subsequently  titrated  to  25  or  50  mg/d.  RECIST-defined  ORR  was  the  primary  endpoint. Secondary  endpoints  included  PFS,  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  quality  of  life  (QoL)  measures.  70  patients  have discontinued, 50 (47%) due to progression, 19 (18%) due to AEs, and 1 due to consent withdrawal. Continuous dosing at 37.5 mg/d has been maintained in 38 patients (36%). Dosing was reduced to 25  mg/d in 47 patients (44%). The most commonly reported (≥5 % of pts) grade 3/4 AEs were  hypertension (10%), asthenia (9%), hand-foot-syndrome (9%), anorexia  (8%),  and  diarrhea  (5%).  No  differences  were  observed  in  AM  vs.  PM  dosing.  RECIST  ORR  was  20% by investigator assessment, with 43 pts (40%) achieving clinical benefit of ≥ 6mos stable disease. Median PFS is 8.3 months.

A second Phase 2 study, Protocol A6181047, is investigating the continuous dosing regimen of sunitinib in patients with gastr-intestinal tract stromal tumors (GISTs) who are refractory to or intolerant of imatinib. Sixty-one patients were enrolled between September 2005 and May 2006. As  of May 2007, results are available for 60 patients, median number of cycles (28 days) started were 11 (range 1-21) with 254 days as the median number of days drug was administered. There were 2 dose escalations to 50 mg/d with 1 reduction back to 37.5 mg/d and 14 dose reductions to 25 mg/d and 8 re-escalations to 37.5 mg/d. There are 8 pts (13%) ongoing, 16 pts (27%) completed and continued to a rollover study, 36  pts  (60%)  discontinued.  Discontinuation  was  due  to  progression  23  (38%),  death  7  (12%)-death  due  to  disease progression 4 (7%), AEs 2 (3%) 1 (2%) unknown.

Response measured by RECIST criteria was reported as 7 (12%) PR and 38 (63%) SD of which 25 (42%) was ≥24 weeks. Median PFS of 35.1 weeks and an OS not yet reached for 60 patients was the  latest data reported at ECCO 2007.

## Sunitinib results in neuroendocrine tumors

A subsequent Phase II study of sunitinib (4/2 schedule) enrolled 43 patients with unresectable  carcinoid tumors and 66 patients with unresectable pancreatic islet cell tumors. Nine percent of patients (2% of carcinoids and 13% of islet tumors) had a partial response (according to RECIST criteria).   82% had stable disease (93% of carcinoids, 75% of pancreatic islet cell tumors). The median time to tumor response was 16 weeks and the median duration of tumor response was not reached. Median time to tumor progression was 40 weeks (42 weeks carcinoid, 33 weeks pancreatic cell islet) and median survival was not reached. It was concluded that sunitinib has modest single agent activity in patients with advanced unresectable neuroendocrine tumors. The high incidence of stable  disease  in  this  study  may be  in  part  attributable  to  treatment  effect,  but  must  be  interpreted  with caution given the indolent natural history of this disease.

In support of continuous dosing, pharmacokinetic modeling of a once daily continuous 37.5 mg dose indicates that the steady state trough concentrations of total drug will be in the region of 60 ng/ml,  which is sufficient to expect a therapeutic  effect  (data  on  file).  Modeling  was  based  on  preclinical  investigations  which  indicated  that  total  drug (sunitinib  +  SU012662)  concentrations  of  50  ng/mL  or  greater  are  required  to  achieve  inhibition  of  receptor phosphorylation. By comparison, at the 50 mg daily dose, mean steady state plasma trough concentrations of 80 ng/ml of total drug are achieved. The estimate for 37.5 mg trough concentrations is also supported by preliminary data (not presented) from a Phase I study in which daily sunitinib doses of 37.5 mg were given.

More recently, the positive results of a positive phase III study have been presented at ASCO 2010 (Nicoli P et al)  which demonstrated a doubling TTP in pancreatic NET patients treated with sunitinib

37.5 mg against placebo ( 11.4 months vs. 5.5 with placebo, HR 0.418, p=0.0001).

Thus, the preliminary safety and pharmacokinetic results of a continuous daily dosing regimen are encouraging and justify the use of the 37.5 mg daily for the proposed study.

## STUDY OBJECTIVES

## Primary objective

The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of Sunitinib on the progression-free survival at 12 months  (12m-PFS)  in  subjects  with  progressive  malignant  pheochromocytoma  and  paraganglioma  treated  with sunitinib at a starting dose of 37.5 mg daily (continuous dosing).

A control group receiving sunitinib placebo will be used as an internal control group.

Secondary objectives

To determine overall Survival and progression free survival. To determine time to progression.

To determine objective response rate at one year.

To determine time to and duration of tumor response.

To assess safety profile including a dedicated cardiovascular management.

## Exploratory objectives

Exploratory analysis will be also performed, including translational research seeking potential relationships between clinical parameters of the disease under study, specific 'biomarker', safety profile, but also symptomatic response (weight,  ECOG  status,  constipation,  blood  pressure,  Visual  Analog  Bone  Pain  Scale,  and  EORTC  QLQ-C30), chromograninA, catecholamine metabolomic profiles assessed by LC-MS/MS and functioning imaging including PETFDG and cancer-and treatment-related outcomes in order to look for predictors of response and surrogate markers of survival.

Cardiovascular  tolerance  will  be  the  focus  of  a  dedicated  survey  based  on  an  in  depth-cardiovascular  work  up  at baseline, home blood pressure monitoring, every week and every month visits during the first three months and active therapeutic management as described in annex 4. In addition a cardiologist has been designated as part of the local medical team in each centre.

## METHODOLOGY

## Study Design Rationale

This study is a multinational, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase II study assessing the efficacy and safety of Sunitinib in subjects with pretreated progressive malignant pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma. Subjects must

have experienced documented progression of disease within 1.5 years prior to the start of the study. The control group of patients receiving Placebo will be used as internal control to assess the hypothesis of 12 months PFS equal to 20% in patients with placebo.

The rational and design of this study take into account the scarcity of this disease (international multicenter phase II, first  line  or  not),  its  heterogeneous  prognosis  (progression  required  at  study  entry)  and  the  absence  of  validated standard after MIBG and or chemotherapy (Placebo as a control arm).

In addition, because of the putative long median survival duration of these patients, PFS at 12 months will be used for the primary endpoint. However patients will be followed to asess overall PFS and survival.

## Study plan

Patients will be enrolled in this randomized phase II trial on 1:1 basis in each arm: Treatment arm = Sunitinib given as 37.5 mg per day continuous regimen Control arm = Placebo

All patients should received best supportive care (excluding anticancer therapy) for symptom and toxicity management.

A treatment period is defined as 28 days.

Subjects not experiencing a response (CR or PR) according to RECIST and experiencing only GLYPH&lt;0&gt; grade 1 non-hematological or GLYPH&lt;0&gt; grade 2 hematological treatment-related adverse events during the first 12 weeks may dose-escalate to 50 mg daily at any time following 12 weeks.

The trial is designed as a Simon two-stages trial, with a first stage analysis after the randomization of 34 pts, 17 in each group.  If  4  or  more  pts  are  alive  without  progression  at  12  months  in  the  sunitinib  group,  40  additional  patients minimum will be randomized, 20 in each group, for a total of 78 patients, including at least 37 patients in Sunitinib arm. The accrual will not be stopped between the inclusion of the 34th patient and the first step analysis.

Treatment  on  study  will  continue  until  disease  progression  is  documented  according  to  the  Response  Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST1.1) or it is in the best interest of the patient to discontinue as judged by the investigator (decisions may be based on achievement of maximum benefit or tolerability issues). At the time of RECIST-defined progression as documented by the investigator, patients randomized on placebo arm will be offered crossover to single agent Sunitinib. Patients randomized to Sunitinib may continue beyond the time of RECIST-defined progression at the discretion of the investigator if the patient is perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit.

## RANDOMIZATION OF PATIENTS

Randomization criteria

Stratification will be used on:

SDH B mutation or not

First line or not

## Method of treatment assignment

The randomization will be made using TENALEA software. The randomization will be stratified as defined above (by minimisation with 20% of random).

After the consent form has been signed and all inclusion criteria checked, the 'Registration and Randomization form' has to be completed directly on the webside or sent by fax to the data manager of the Biostatistics and Epidemiology unit of Gustave Roussy. The randomization will result in the allocation of a patient number which is the same than the treatment box number. A confirmation of the randomization will be sent (by fax or email) to the investigator and to LC 2 in charge of the shipment of the treatment/placebo boxes.

The treatment of the first 34 eligible patients (first stage) will be randomized. The study continuation is based on the results observed on the first 17 patients of the sunitinib arm: either randomization continues in both arms, or it is stopped in both arms. The accrual will not be stopped between the inclusion of the 34th patient and the first step analysis.

## TREATMENTS

## Study treatments

The investigational study drug is Sunitinib. Patients will receive either Sunitinib 37.5 mg daily or Placebo if randomized in the placebo arm. Sunitinib will be swallowed whole with a glass of water once daily at the same time each day in a fasting state

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are transmembrane proteins containing extracellular  ligand-binding domains and intracellular catalytic domains. RTKs are activated following binding of their cognate ligands and many of the processes involved in tumor growth, progression, and metastases are mediated by signaling molecules acting downstream from these proteins. Several members of the split-kinase domain family of RTKs are implicated in deregulated/ autocrine proliferation  and  survival  of  solid  and  hematologic  cancer  cells.  These  include  the  platelet-derived  growth  factor receptors (PDGFR a and b ); vascular endothelial  growth factor receptors (VEGFR) Type 1 and 2 (FLT1 and FLK1/KDR); the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor, KIT, and the FLT3-ligand receptor. In addition, PDGFR and VEGFR are implicated in tumor-dependent angiogenesis.

Sunitinib malate is an orally administered small molecule that inhibits the tyrosine kinase enzymatic activities  of  the receptors for VEGF and PDGF, and also blocks signalling through the KIT, FLT3  and RET pathways. Therefore, sunitinib malate provides an opportunity for a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of subjects with malignant PPGLs. For further details refer to the sunitinib malate Investigator Brochure (IB).

## Administration

Sunitinib will be administered orally from Day 1 at the starting dose of 37.5 mg daily in a continuous  daily regimen.

## Packaging and Labeling

The label(s) for IMP will include sponsor name, address and telephone number, the protocol number, IMP name, dosage form, amount of IMP per container, lot number, expiry date, medication identification, patient number, storage conditions, and required caution statements and/or regulatory statements as applicable. Additional information may be included on the label as applicable per local regulations.

## Drug supply

Study medication consisting of sunitinib or matching placebo will be supplied as hard gelatin oral capsules  containing 12.5 mg of sunitinib free base. The sponsor will provide sunitinib (via Pfizer)  and matching placebo. The drug supply will be delegated to LC 2 by the sponsor. LC 2 will supply the oral drug formulation in light-resistant bottles containing 30 of the 12.5 mg capsules to the clinic pharmacy.

## Dispensing

Sunitinib or matching placebo capsules will be dispensed by the study center during patient clinic visits.

## Dose and schedule modifications for toxicity

Subjects experiencing severe toxicity (see dose modification table below) should have 1-week treatment rests, but no more than 6 weeks, inserted into the regimen as needed and may dose reduce depending on individual tolerability. The dose of 37.5 mg may be reduced to 25 or 12.5 mg daily, which is the minimum dose acceptable for daily dosing of sunitinib. Intra-patient re-escalation of study medication back to previous dose is permitted at the discretion of the investigator and considering the patient's clinical status.

Subjects   not   experiencing   a   response    by    RECIST    criteria    and    experiencing    only Grade £ 1 non-hematological or Grade £ 2 hematological toxicity within 12 weeks of treatment may dose escalate to 50 mg daily.

If dose is escalated or reduced, treatment will continue to be on a continuous daily dosing schedule.

The  available  dose  levels  for  sunitinib/placebo  are  presented  in  Table  1.  Intrapatient dose  interruptions  and/or reductions  may  be  permitted  in  case  a  patient  has  experienced  unacceptable  toxicity provided that study discontinuation  criteria  have  not  been  met.  Sunitinib/placebo  may  be  dose reduced by up to two dose levels to a minimum of 12.5 mg/day according to Table 2.

Table 1. Available Sunitinib/Placebo Dose Levels

|   Dose Level |   Daily Dose (mg) |
|--------------|-------------------|
|           +1 |              50   |
|            0 |              37.5 |
|           -1 |              25   |
|           -2 |              12.5 |

Doses reduced for drug-related toxicity should generally not be re-escalated. However, intrapatient re-escalation back to the previous dose level may be permitted at the discretion of the investigator after discussion with the sponsor. Dose reduction of the regimen will be dependent on the severity (based on NCI CTCAE v.4.0 grade), manageability, and relatedness of toxicity to sunitinib/placebo.

Patients who develop grade 4 hyperuricemia or grade 3 hypophosphatemia without clinical symptoms may continue study treatment without interruption at the discretion of the investigator. Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea must persist at grade 3 or 4 despite maximal medical therapy.

** Patients who develop grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia may continue study treatment without interruption.

HTA: Due to the specific risk  related  to  uncontrolled  HTA  in  pheochromocytoma, home blood  pressure monitoring will be organize (see Annex 4)

Proteinuria: Urine protein will be assessed via a dipstick protein urinalysis at baseline, as clinically indicated, and at the end of treatment, with only dipstick urine protein results captured in  the  database. If the results of the dipstick test indicate a ≥2+ proteinuria, follow-up should be performed with a quantitative urine protein analysis according to local standard practices, if proteinuria is:

&lt;1g/24h: Sutent ® is dispensed without nephrologist's opinion.

≥1g/24h and &lt; 3g/24h: a nephrologist's opinion is required but the treatment should not be  delayed.

≥3g/24h: a consultation with the nephrologist is required before the dispensation of the  treatment.

All intrapatient dose reductions are relative to the lowest dose level of the current cycle. The dosing period may not be extended to compensate for interruptions in study treatment due to any cause. However, the start of the next cycle may be delayed if  additional  time  is  required  for  the  patient  to  recover  from  study  treatment-associated  toxicity experienced during the current cycle.

## Dose Re-Escalation

Intrapatient re-escalation back to the previous dose level is permitted in the absence of grade ≥3 hematologic or grade ≥2 non-hematologic treatment-related toxicity in the previous cycle.

Treatment discontinuation should not exceed 6 weeks.

Study drug dosing should be interrupted if a patient experiences ³ grade 3 clinically significant toxicity related to study drug, with the exception of grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea if not premedicated or adequately treated.  Dose interruptions for intolerable grade 2 toxicity related to study drug or other unrelated toxicities may be made at the discretion of the investigator. Upon resolution of the toxicity to £ grade 1 or no more than 1 grade above baseline, study drug may be reintroduced at the same level or level -1. Prophylactic or supportive therapies may be introduced following experience with initial doses of study drug.

If  any  toxicity  requiring  dose  interruption  recurs  despite  the  initial  dose  reduction  to  25  mg/day,  study drug may be reduced again to level -2.

## Concomitant treatments

## General Concomitant Medication and Herbal Supplements Considerations

Every medication including non-prescription medications and herbal supplements (eg, St. John's  wort) or treatment taken by the patient during the trial and the reason for its administration must be recorded on the CRF.

## Drugs with Proarrhythmic Potential

Concomitant treatment with a drug having proarrhythmic potential (terfenadine, quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, sotalol, probucol, bepridil, haloperidol, risperidone, indapamide and flecainide) is not permitted during the study.

## Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4

Sunitinib  is  primarily  metabolized  by  liver  enzymes,  in  particular  CYP3A4.  There  was  a  mean  1.8-fold  increase  in exposure  of  sunitinib  when  co-administered  with  ketoconazole,  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  and  a  mean  4-fold decrease in exposure of sunitinib when co-administered with rifampin,  a potent inducer of CYP3A4. Therefore, coadministration with potent inhibitors (ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, delavirdine, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, atazanavir, nelfinavir) and inducers (rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital,  phenytoin, St. John's wort, efavirenz, tipranavir) of CYP3A4 may result in significant increases/decreases in exposure of sunitinib and may alter the safety/efficacy of the drug. Pravastatin  drug (10-80mg/d) will be favor to treat dyslipidemia.

All potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers are not permitted 7 and 12 days before dosing, respectively. During the study,  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  and  inducers  are  not  recommended.  Alternative  therapies  should  be  used  when available.  If usage of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor or inducer is necessary, this must be in agreement with the Sponsor.

Please see this website for more information on CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers: http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart/table.htm

## Anticoagulants

The use of coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin (Coumadin â ) is not recommended. However, doses up to 2 mg daily are permitted for prophylaxis of thrombosis as well as heparin.

## Approved or Experimental Therapy for Cancer

No  other  approved  or  investigational  anticancer  treatment  will  be  permitted  during  the  study  period,  including chemotherapy, biological response modifiers, hormone therapy, or immunotherapy. No other investigational drug may be used during treatment on this protocol, and concurrent participation  in another clinical trial is not allowed.

Somatostatin analogues for symptomatic treatment are not allowed.

## Antiemetic and Antidiarrheal Therapy

Supportive care may include pre-medication with antiemetics (apart from metoclopramide and other dopamine D2 receptor antagonists) to limit treatment-related nausea and vomiting. Patients may receive prophylaxis of treatmentinduced diarrhea but constipation should be avoided if possible and constipation actively treated (Dopa D2 antagonists should be avoided).

## Hematopoietic Growth Factors

Prophylactic use of hematopoietic growth factors to support neutrophil or platelet counts is permitted during this study. Treatment with sunitinib should continue during granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) treatment unless the patient is experiencing complicated neutropenia (prolonged or associated with fever or infection). Patients who enter the study on stable doses of erythropoietin (epoetin) or darbepoietin may continue this treatment, and patients may start either drug during the study at the discretion of the investigator. Patients with neutropenic fever or infection should be treated promptly and may receive therapeutic colony-stimulating factors if appropriate.

## Other Concomitant Medications

Anti-inflammatory or narcotic analgesics may be offered as needed. Packed red blood cell and  platelet transfusions should be administered as clinically indicated.

Patients on this trial may be supported with appropriate hormone replacement therapy in the event they develop adrenal or thyroid insufficiency in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable treatment-associated toxicity. Patients with pre-existing thyroid disease may also be treated with thyroid hormone replacement.

Patients may receive biphosphonates for treatment of their bone metastases as long as they started before study entry.

Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported in patients treated with Sutent. The majority of cases occurred in  patients  who  had  received  previous  or  concomitant  treatment  with  intravenous  bisphosphonate,  for  which osteonecrosis  of  the  jaw  is  an  identified  risk.  Caution  should  therefore  be  exercised  when  Sutent  and  i.v. biphosphonates are used simultaneoustly or sequentially.

In case of hyperglycemia, diet and Metfornine will be used as first line. Caution should be exercise in  the management of drug able to induce hypoglycemia. Withdrawal of hypoglycemic therapies will be  discussed in case on normalization of glucose levels and or discontinuation of Sunitinib.

## Concomitant Radiotherapy or Surgery

Palliative  radiotherapy  to  specific  sites  of  disease  is  permitted  if  considered  medically  necessary  by  the  treating physician. Study treatment should be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy  - stopping 1 day before and resuming treatment 1 day after.   The intensities, number, and dates of doses received for allowed palliative radiotherapy should be  recorded  on  the  appropriate  CRFs.  Subjects  requiring  palliative  radiotherapy  will  not  be  considered  to  have progressive disease if  RECIST 1.1 criteria are not strictly confirmed. Lesions that have been irradiated are no longer evaluable according to RECIST guidelines.

Sunitinib treatment has not been specifically observed to interfere with wound healing; however, caution is advised on theoretical grounds. In the event major surgery is necessary during study participation, sunitinib dosing should be stopped 2 weeks before surgery and resumed 2 weeks after surgery etails regarding the surgery should be recorded on the CRF.

Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported in patients treated with Sutent. Invasive dental procedures are alsoa an identified risk factor. Dental examination and appropriate  preventive dentistry should be considered before treatment with Sutent. Invasive dental procedures should be avoided, if possible, in patients treated with sunitinib who have previously received, or who are receiving, intravenous bisphosphonates.

## Required Concomitant Therapy

Active management of Hypertension and cardiovascular alterations required see annex 4. Active management of painful bone metastases is required. Hypomagnesemia and hypophosphoremia will be supplemented.

## TRIAL PROCEDURE

## Screening phase

All  patients  should  be  screened  for  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  and  baseline  evaluations  should  be performed within 4 weeks prior the inclusion. See section 7.7 for detailed information on baseline evaluations required.

Before study start, all patients must have pathologically confirmed advanced-unresectable or metastaticpheocromocytoma  or  paraganglioma  as  defined  per  inclusion  criteria.  The  radiological  tumor  assessment  which documents a progression as defined by RECIST criteria should not be older than  4  weeks  at  time  of  screening  visit. Progression  should  be  assessed  within  the  previous  18  months.

Screening and baseline evaluations include: obtaining patient informed consent prior to any study related procedures, evaluation of inclusion and exclusion criteria, slides and/or block recovery,  physical examination (including a dedicated cardiovascular work-up as defined section 7.7), vital signs, ECOG status, review of past medical history, documentation of prior therapies and toxicities, hormone marker assessment, genetic status, extent of cancer sites at imaging including an in-depth evaluation of all foci of bone uptake at scintigraphic imaging, pregnancy tests.

The  radiological  evaluation  has  to  be  consistent  throughout  the  study  including  the  time  of  drug  discontinuation whatever the reasons. A specific guided documentation of foci discovered at PET- FDG (or MIBG or SRS if providing a higher level of information at baseline), using conventional imaging, is required (using CT or MIR) including bone sites both at baseline and during follow-up.

Questions about eligibility criteria should be addressed PRIOR to randomization. The eligibility criteria for this study have been carefully considered. Eligibility criteria are standards used to ensure that patients who enter this study are medically appropriate candidates for this therapy.

Since treatment with Sutent ® may be a risk factor for the development of osteonecrosis of the jaw, particularly if a patient has previously received, or is treated concurrently with, bisphosphonates, dental examination and appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered before randomisation.

For the safety of the patients, as well as to ensure that the results of this study can be useful for making treatment decisions regarding other patients with similar diseases, there will be no exceptions  to eligibility requirements at the time of randomization.

## Treatment phase

Upon completion of all screening tests and confirmation of eligibility, patients will be randomized on  a 1:1 basis to receive either Sunitinib or Placebo. Treatment will start within the 7 days after  randomization. Patients will receive best supportive care in both arms.

During the study, radiological and hormone assessments will be performed every 12 weeks (+/- 5 days). The treatment period for the study is 24 months.

A dose decrease will be considered if tolerability issues arise (see section 7.5). Patients requiring a dose reduction should return to the higher dose once the tolerability as resolved.

Treatment on study will continue until disease progression is documented according to the RECIST

1.1  or  it  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the  patient  to  discontinue  as  judged  by  the  investigator  (decisions  may be based on  achievement  of  maximum  benefit  or  tolerability  issues).  At  the  time  of  RECIST  1.1- defined  progression  as documented by the investigator,  patients  randomized  on  placebo  arm  will  be  offered  crossover  to  single  agent Sunitinib.  Patients  randomized  to  Sunitinib  may  continue  beyond  the  time  of  RECIST-defined  progression  at  the discretion of the investigator if the patient  is perceived to be experiencing clinical benefit.

Treatment will be given until a progressive disease is demonstrated or  unacceptable toxicity occurs or  the patient decides to discontinue study participation or until the primary analysis for the study is performed. All efforts must be made to ensure a proper imaging evaluation of all patients at the time of drug discontinuation.

After the 24-month treatement period or at treatment interuption, the patient will enter in the follow- up phase.

## Follow-up phase

Patients who stop their treatment before 2 years will be followed during a year period. Patients who still receive treatment  at  the  end  of  treatment  period  (2  years)  will  enter  in  the  follow-up  phase  without  discontinuing  their treatment. The follow-up strategy will be identical to the treatment phase.

## Study Duration

Treatment with study drug will continue until the patient meets any of the criteria for discontinuation (see Section 7.6). In case of drug discontinuation based on RECIST 1.1 criteria, central  review of both conventional and PET-FDG results are mandatory for confirmation. Any subsequent anticancer therapy will be at the discretion of the investigator.

It is expected to recruit 5 to 12 pts / year. At least 1 patient is expected to be enrolled per year in at least 16 centers during 5 years. All patients will be followed in the study during a 12-month period after the treatment period. 3-year overall survival and 3-year free progression survival will be  collected through medical records.

## Subject discontinuation

The following events are considered sufficient reasons for discontinuing a subject from the  investigational medicinal product and/or from the study:

Adverse Event(s) with failure to recover despite drug interruption of 6 weeks (42 days)

Lack of therapeutic effect = disease progression clearly assessed by the investigator  judgement and confirmed by central review

Withdrawal of consent

Death

Lost to follow up

Protocol violation

The reason for discontinuation should be recorded in the CRF and in the source documents.

## Table of Events or Visit Schedule and assessments

Table 2 lists all of the assessments and indicates with and 'X' the visits when they are performed. All  data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the patient's source documentation.

## Screening failure

Patients who complete the informed consent process and do not meet all entry criteria and therefore who were not randomized will be considered screen failures. Patient's characteristics such as age, gender and reason of screen failure will be described.

## Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics

The  following  will  be  included  :  demography,  medical  history/current  medical  conditions,  diagnosis  and  extent  of cancer, prior anticancer therapies taken, disease-related symptoms and grading, concomitant medication taken, ECOG status, vital signs, blood pressure, pulse rate, cardiovascular and renal evaluation including cardiac ultrasonography, ECG, blood tests including, pregnancy tests , urinanalysis including microalbuminuria.

## Treatment

This study has treatment duration of 24 months with a follow-up every 12 months thereafter.  Compliance  will  be assessed  by  the  investigator  and  or  study  personnel  at  each  visit.  Records  of  study medication used, treatment administered, and interval between visits will be kept during the study. This information should be captured in the source document at each visit.

## Efficacy

Primary efficacy assessment:

Response evaluation will be performed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. The same method of assessment  and  the same  technique  including  early  arterial  phase  imaging  for  the  liver  (30  sec)  should be used to characterize each identified lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Each center must have a designated radiologist responsible for the interpretation of CR scans and or MRI and the response evaluation according to RECIST 1.1 criteria during the entire duration of the study.

Scan to allow measurement of all target lesions will be performed routinely every twelve weeks. Response evaluation will be performed according to the RECIST 1.1 as described in detail in annex 11.

PET-FDG is performed at each evaluation together with conventional imaging. According to the judgment of the local investigator,  other  scintigraphic  imaging  such  as  MIBG  or  SRS  can  be  performed  in  addition  to  PET-FDG  if complementary or replace PET-FDG if negative. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Guided CT or MRI will be performed in case of new lesions only seen  at PET-FDG (or MIBG or SRS) in order to confirm new lesions by another conventional imaging means. Results of FDOPA or FDA will not be taken into account since not routinely available in all centers.

a Screening assessments completed within 21 days prior to Day 1 do not need to be repeated. Progression according to RECIST 1.1 must be confirmed over 1.5 year period of time prior study entry. Assessments may be done up to 3 days prior to Day 1 for all other cycles.

Study Entry

Complete cardiovascular history: assessment of blood pressure,  calculated  glomerular  filtration rate, left ventricular function (US or istopic means), micro albuminuria

b All prior radiotherapy, surgeries, and chemotherapies and dates of therapies must be recorded as well as the quality of response, duration and tolerance. Recovery from severe toxicity is mandatory.

Vascular comorbity including heart, kidney dysfunction will be carefully checked and appropriately managed prior inclusion. Calculated glomerular filtration rate, 24h-proteinuria, 24h-blood pressure monitoring and heart echography are mandatory prior study initiation. Home blood pressure monitoring will be organized before enrolment to assess blood pressure control.

Effective contraception is mandatory for female and male

Safety Assessements c All subjects will have a physical examination at screening, every cycle Day 1, every 7 days during the first 4 weeks, every month during 3 months and then every 3 months or at treatment discontinuation, and 28 days after last dose. Vital  signs,  blood  pressure,  pain-related  symptoms  and  constipation  need  dedicated  assessment  and  follow-up. Investigators are to report any clinically significant abnormal findings as adverse events.

d Vital signs (including ECOG status, weigh, blood pressure, pulse rate, and temperature) will be measured screening, every cycle Day 1, every 7 days during the first 4 weeks, every month during 3 months and then every 3 months or at treatment discontinuation, and 28 days after last dose.  Investigators are to report any clinically significant abnormal findings as adverse events.

e ECG to be performed as follows: Three ECG should be performed during screening and at one month, and in case of drug dosage alteration and discontinuation. All 3 ECGs from Day 1 onward must be performed at 5 minutes apart after the subject has been in the supine position for 3 minutes. Heart echography should be performed at baseline , every 3 months on treatment period and repeated every 3 month if treated by open Sunitib (after unblinding)

f  Hematology  laboratory  evaluations  (RBC  count,  haemoglobin,  hematocrit,  WBC  count  and  differential,  ANC,  and platelet count) will be collected at screening, every cycle Day 1, every 7 days during the first 4 weeks, every month during 3 months and then every 3 months or at treatment discontinuation, and 28 days after last dose. Any or all laboratory evaluations may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.

g Serum chemistry laboratory evaluations (sodium, potassium, chloride, CO2, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, BUN, creatinine, calculated glomerular filtration rate, glucose, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin [total and direct], AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, LDH and uric acid,  dipstick with proteinuria measurement if 2 +) will be collected at screening, every cycle Day 1, every 7 days during Phase 1 Cycle 1, at treatment discontinuation, and 28 days after last dose. TSH, FT4 measurement will be performed at baseline and repeated when required as judged by local investigator. Any or all laboratory evaluations may be repeated more frequently if  clinically indicated.

Genetic screening will include search for SDH and VHL mutations in all patients and results will refered to the genetician of  the  study  for  quality  evaluation.  RET  mutation  will  be  screened  in  case  of  positive  serum  calcitonine.  Clinical screening for NF1 will be performed. Search for large deletion of the SDH gene but also mutation will be routinely

performed in each center and centralized on request  (see  annex  8).  The  same  will  be  applied  if  a  centre  is  not able  to  locally  perform  the  genetic  screening.

NCI-CTCAE v.4 will be used to report toxicity.

Efficacy Assessments h Tumor assessment using neck, chest , abdomen and pelvic conventional (or spiral) CT scans and or MRI will be done at screening as well as a PET-FDG (or best diagnostic functioning imaging among PET-FDG, MIBG or SRS scans; FDA or FDOPA scan results will not be done since not available in all centers ). Liver MRI is optional and will be performed if quality of CT scan is judged insufficient at baseline by local investigators to evaluate liver metastase targets. Spine MRI is recommended on a routine basis also at least at baseline. Brain imaging will be considered optional and performed based on the clinic and results of scintigraphic imaging. For subjects with measurable disease at screening, scans using the same methodology are required every 3 months whatever the number of cycles and at treatment discontinuation. Typically,  in  the  absence  of  drug  withdrawal  imaging  work  up  will  be performed at screening, and then every 3 months (before Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 7 day 1…. ). Subjects with scans done during the screening period do not need a scan at Cycle 1 Day 1.   Scans must be done  up  to  21  days  prior  to  Day  1  of  the  cycle  during  the  treatment  phase. Confirmatory  scans  should be obtained at least 28 days following documentation of objective response. To ensure comparability,  baseline  methods  and  on-study  methods  for  tumor  assessment  must  be  performed  using identical techniques. Early arterial phase (20-30 sec post contrast agent infusion) is mandatory for liver CT or MRI. Scans should be performed at treatment discontinuation unless last scan was performed within the prior 28 days. Interpretation of bone will be routinely done together with a routine CT or MRI-guided analysis and follow-up of focus of uptake at scintigraphic imaging

i. hormonal assessment : plasma chromogranine A (CGA - IRMA CisBio) and plasma and 24h- urinary metanephrines, normetanephrines and methoxytyramines / mmol u-creatinin/L (HPLC) will be measured at baseline and every 3 cycles. Plasma and urinary samples will be stored locally and skipped to central lab every three months. Calculated creatinine clearance and proton pomp inhibitor IPP medication will be evaluated at the time of hormone evaluation. In case of IPP medication, treatment discontinuation 7 days prior Chromogranine A measurement will be organized if possible. Otherwise, Choromogranine A measurement will be considered not applicable.

j.  Calculated  glomerular  filtration  rate,  dipstick  (if  2+,  determine  24h  proteinuria),  are  repeated  at  each  evaluation (weekly  during  the  first  month,  monthly  during  the  first  3  months  and  every  3  months thereafter).Home blood pressure monitoring will be performed 3 times in the morning and in the evening the last 7 days each evaluation (weekly during the first month, monthly during the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter) will be organized. Heart echography should be repeated every 3 months only in case of abnormal cardiovascular event.

Safety Assessment: ECG Monitoring:

Three consecutive 12-lead ECGs (with a 10-second rhythm strip) will be collected approximately 2 minutes apart at screening and on Cycle 2 Day 1 (pre-dose) to determine the mean QTc interval. It is preferable that the machine used has a capacity to calculate the standard intervals automatically. If  the mean QTc interval is prolonged (Grade &gt;1), the

ECGs should be overread by a cardiologist at the site for confirmation. Additional ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated and following intrapatient Sunitinib/Placebo dose modifications such as:

Dose escalation for any reason, or

Dose reduction in response to:

QTc interval prolongation, significant electrolyte changes, vomiting, diarrhea, or,

addition of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor

These should be performed approximately 2 weeks after reaching new steady-state levels of  Sunitinib/placebo.

MUGA scan or ECHO : Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) will be assessed at screening and as clinically indicated thereafter. Effort should be made to perform follow-up tests (using the same modality as was used at screening) until LVEF  returns  to  baseline,  the  lower  limit  of  normal  for  the  institution  (LLN),  or  no  improvement  is  seen  after  2 consecutive tests at least 4 weeks apart.

## BLINDING AND UNBLINDING

## Setup process

The  conditions  under  which  unblinding  will  be  performed  are  described  in  the  trial  protocol  in  section 8.3 and in the paragraph with the heading name of «Unblinding modality ». Additionally; a contact telephone number has been provided (identical number in both the protocol and information note).

If  the  phone numbers of the contact person doesn't appear in the information note of the patient, a card holding information will be given at the inclusion in the trial.

In  agreement  with  the  PI  of  the  study,  a  list  of  all  serious  adverse  events  which  will  constitute  an  appropriate justification for unblinding has been defined.

## Randomisation List

The Biostatistics and Epidemiology Service (SBE) will establish the randomisation list and will store  a copy of it.

The  SBE  will  provide  the  randomisation  list  to  LC 2 for  the  preparation  and  labelling  of  the therapeutic  unit (Sutent/placebo) and the creation of sealed code break envelopes (3 copies).

These envelopes will be sent by LC 2 at the same time as the trial drugs:

To the investigatory sites (exclusively patients of the center)

To IGR Clinical Pharmacy Department (CPD) (all the patients)

To IGR Pharmacovigilance Unit (UFPV) (all the patients)

## Unblinding  process

## At the Clinical Pharmacy Department of Gustave-Roussy :

At  the  initiation  of  the  clinical  trial  at  IGR,  the  project  manager  will  give  the  following  documents  to  the  UFEC responsible person:

Most recent protocol,

Latest version of the IB,

An unblinding procedure in accordance with the protocol,

A list of SAEs that will justify the unblinding of the trial treatment,

Unblinding request forms.

The project manager will give the dated and signed receipt to UFPV attesting that the documents had been given. The CRA will have the responsibilities to unsure an up-to-date document (procedure, unbliding forms, protocols, IB…) are in place.

Theses documents and envelopes will be stored in the office of the UFEC responsible person, in a locked cupboard.

The UFEC responsible person is in charge of the formation of the pharmacists and interns of  pharmacy to the unblinding procedures. These formations will be subject to recording.

At investigator center level:

The unblinding procedure is explained by the sponsor's CRA to the investigator and/or the  pharmacist in charge at every center at the setting up of the study.

He  then  gives  the  following  documents  to  the  principal  investigator  and/or  to  the  pharmacist  in  charge:

Most recent protocol,

Latest version of the IB,

An unblinding procedure in accordance with the protocol,

A list of SAEs that will justify the unblinding of the trial treatment,

Unblinding request forms.

The sponsor's CRA will give the dated and signed receipt to the UFPV attesting that the documents had been given and that the investigators understood the unblinding procedure and that they will follow it.

The CRA will have the responsibilities to ensure an up-to-date document (procedure, unblinding forms, protocols, IB…) are in place.

## Unblinding modalities

Unblinding is expected in the protocol in the following cases:

In case of SUSARs (see section 11).

In  emergency  situations  (e.g  life-threatening  event..)  if  the  knowledge  of  the  administered  product  is necessary  for  the  patient's  treatment.  When  trial  treatment  is  accidentally  or  intentionally  received  by  a person other than the trial participants, unblinding may also be warranted.

In case of disease progression following the RECIST (1.1) criteria, the investigator could request unblinding. The request should be a written and documented request and will be reviewed by the steering committee for approval.

After unblinding, a patient on placebo could switch to SUTENT until disease progression, patient refusal or unacceptable toxicity.

The unblinding results will be transmitted to UFPV/CPD, PI and Project manager.

## STUDY ENDPOINTS

## Primary endpoint

The primary endpoint of the study is progression free survival at 12 months (12 month-PFS).

Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

Progression will be assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria based on conventional imaging (CT and or MRI of the neck, thorax; abdomen and pelvic)  and  best  scintigraphic  imaging  (among  PET-FDG,  MIBG  or SRS; no other scintigraphic method will be used in the frame of the study since not performed by all centers).

In order to consider a new focus at scintigraphic imaging as a progression, it appearance should be confirmed by at least another conventional imaging method.

Imaging work up will be performed every 3 months.

Progression at baseline and during the study will be assessed by investigators judgment  and confirmed by the steering committee (See annex 9).

## Secondary endpoints

Overall progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation of objective tumor progression or to death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.

Overall Survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to documentation of death due to  any cause.

Time-to-tumor-progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization to first documentation  of objective tumor progression.

Objective response rate (ORR) defined as complete plus partial responses at one year. Response definitions will be based on RECIST 1.1

Duration of response (DR), defined as the time from the first documentation of OR (CR or PR) that is  subsequently confirmed, to the first documentation of tumor progression or death due to any cause.

Toxicity  using  NCI-CTCAE  V4  criteria  and  dedicated  FIRSTMAPPP  program  for  cardiovascular  evaluation  and management (Home blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular management is defined in annex 4).

## Exploratory endpoints

Various exploratory analyses will be performed in ancillary studies, based on dedicated funding. Tissue,  blood  and urinary  samples  will  be  collected  and  stored  after  appropriate  measurements  in  each center at the beginning and during the study. No additional sampling is required in this setting.

-To determine the correlation between clinical and biological parameters (age, gender, ECOG, weigh,  Visial Analog Pain bone Scale and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire results and clinical paramaters including primary location, presence of hormone-related symptoms, SDH mutation, type or level of plasma or urinary metanephrine secretions, level of CgA secretion,  number and type of tumor organs,  time to tumor progression before study entry and additional blood markers of angiogenesis, number of previous lines of therapy, centre), status for biomarkers (KI 67, mitotic count, necrosis, SDH , VEGFR2-3, HIF, CA IX, PDGFR, FGFR, MGMT status …..) and OR, PFS and survival.

-To look for hormone complete or objective response (normalization or decrease &gt; 50% of CgA and or the sum of plasma or urinary metanephrine results) or PET-FDG alteration (as defined by PERCIST 1.0) or conventional imaging perfusion or toxicity profile, correlation with OR, PFS or overall survival. To look for correlation between OR or PFS and survival.

Plasma concentrations of CgA will be measured by enzyme immunoassay using  a  commercial  ELISA Kit method (K0025, Dako  Denmark).  Plasma  and  urinary  concentrations  of  catecholamines  and  catecholamine  metabolites  will  be measured  by  HPLC  with  electrochemical  detection  of  by  LC-  MS/MS.  Patients  receiving  proton  pump  inhibitors, experiencing atrophic chronic gastritis or kidney impairment will be excluded from hormonal evaluation based on recognized false positive causes for each marker. Metabolomic profiling of tumor tissue, plasma and urine will also be carried out taking advantage of the QTRAP functionality of the LC-MS/MS instrument. This instrument thus enables more comprehensive profiling of the monoamine metabolome in single samples than allowed by currently available HPLC equipment. This profiling should enable a clearer understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships and may also lead to identification of unique cancer biomarkers.

## DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

## Number of Subjects

The total number of patient will be (see sample size and power considerations):

at minimum = 34 patients at maximum = 78 patients

This study will be conducted in Europe over a period of 5 years. It is expected to enroll 1.2 patients per year in 16 centers.

Statistical Analyses

## Overview

Progression free survival (PFS) at 12 months is the primary endpoint of this study.

## Study Population Definitions

Analysis will be done on an Intent To Treat Basis (ITT).

## Sample Size and Power Considerations

Analysis of the primary endpoint (12-months PFS) will be assessed on the Intent to Treat (ITT) population and data set will be based upon central imaging review. The basic assumption is a 20% increase - from 20% to 40% of the 12-months PFS. The analysis will be performed according the Simon design (Simon R, 1989) with alpha=10% and power 90%. The placebo group serves for validation of the hypothesis that without active treatment the 12-m-PFS is 20%. Therefore, the sunitinib group and the placebo group will not be compared directly.

## First stage analysis:

In the first stage, 34 patients will be randomized with 17 patients in each group. The first analysis  will be performed when the 12 months evaluation of the 17 patients of the sunitinib group has been obtained. If less than 4 patients show no progression of disease at 12 months, the accrual will be stopped and sunitinib treatment will be considered as ineffective. If 4 or more patients show no progression at 12 months, the trial will continue and 40 additional patients minimum (20 per group) will be randomized for a total of 78 patients, including at least 37 patients in Sunitinib arm.

## Second stage analysis:

At the end of the second stage, the final analysis will be performed when the 12 months evaluation has been obtained for all the 78 patients, including at least 37 patients in Sunitinib arm.

If less than 11 patients out of the sunitinib group (37 patients) show no progression of disease at 12 months,  sunitinib will  be  considered  ineffective  (Simon  design  conclusion).  Conversely,  if  11  or  more patients show no progression at 12 months, sunitinib will be considered effective (Simon design  conclusion).

The placebo group will serve as an internal control to validate the hypothesis of the Simon design with a 12-m PFS equal to 20%. The 90% Confidence Interval (90%CI) of the 12 months PFS will be calculated on the 37 patients of the placebo group. If 20% is included in the 90%CI, the final conclusion will be the Simon design conclusion. Conversely, if 20% is not included in the  90%CI,  the final conclusion will be taken as follows:

Placebo group: observed 90%CI Sunitinib group: Simon plan

|                      | Positive results        | Negative results        |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| 20% < lower boundary |                         |                         |
|                      | Discuss the results     | Simon design conclusion |
| 20% within the 90%CI | Simon design conclusion | Simon design conclusion |
| 20% > upper boundary | Simon design conclusion | Discuss the results     |

Overall, a minimum of 34 patients and a maximum of 78 patients, including at least 37 patients in Sunitinib arm, will be enrolled in the trial.

## Background and Demographic Characteristics

A summary of subjects enrolled by site will be provided.

Baseline  characteristics  will  be  presented  as  numbers  and  percentages  for  qualitative  data  and  means  (Standard Deviation) or medians (range) for quantitative data.

## Subject Disposition

A profile trial summarizing patient's allocation, compliance, deviations and follow-up will be presented.

## Efficacy Analysis

The first analysis will be performed when the 12 months evaluation of the 17 patients of the sunitinib group has been obtained. And at the end of the second stage, the final analysis will be performed when the 12 months evaluation has been obtained for all the 78 patients including at least 37 patients in Sunitinib arm.

Analysis of the primary endpoint i.e. 12-months PFS: see sample size and power considerations.

Analysis of the secondary endpoints: PFS and OS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method and presented with Rothman's 95% Confidence Intervals. Median follow-up will be estimated using inverse Kaplan-Meier method (Collet D., 1994).

The percentage of objective response will be presented with exact 95% confidence intervals.

## Safety Analysis

All randomized subjects who take at least 1 dose of agent (either experimental or control) will be included in the safety analyses. Adverse events will be summarized by worst severity grade. AEs, as well as treatment-emergent AEs, will be summarized by system organ class, and preferred term. IMP-related adverse events, adverse events leading to death or to discontinuation from treatment, events classified as NCI-CTCAE v4 Grade 3 or Grade 4 (or moderate/severe if other rating scale is used), IMP-related events, and serious adverse events will be summarized separately.

Cross tabulations will be provided to summarize frequencies of abnormalities.  Descriptive statistics will be provided for vital sign and body weight data.

By- subject listings will be provided for all relevant safety data.

Graphical displays and figures will be provided where useful to assist in the interpretation of results  especially blood pressure handling.

Descriptive analysis will be described for:

Deaths

SAEs

AE drop-outs

AEs

Other Topics

Exploratory analysis will be separately funded and performed based upon the outcome of the  translational research data.

## ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS

Definition

## Adverse Event (AE)

An Adverse Event (AE) is any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered an investigational (medicinal) product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including abnormal  laboratory  findings  for  example),  symptom,  or  disease temporally associated with the use  of a medical product, whether or not a causal relationship (i.e. related/not related) with the treatment is suspected.

## Serious Adverse Event (SAE)

A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:

is fatal (results in death)

is life-threatening

requires or prolongs in-patient hospitalization results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity

is a congenital anomaly / birth defect is medically significant (defined as any clinical event or laboratory result that may not be immediately lifethreatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention (eg,medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious  outcomes  listed  in  the  definition  above.  Examples  of  such  events  include  but  are  not  limted  to, allergic  bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, development of drug dependency or  drug abuse)

A SAE judged as potentially related to a study drug qualifys as Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR).

Events  exclusively  related  to  tumour  relapse  /  progression  or  treatment  of  tumour  relapse  /  progressions are not considered as SAE.

## NOTE:

The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs:

A  visit  to  the  emergency  room  or  other  hospital  department  that  does  not  result  in  admission  (unless considered an 'medically significant event' or a life-threatening event)

Outpatient or same-day or ambulatory procedures

Observation or short-stay units

Hospitalization  due  to  diagnostic  procedures  or  standard  supportive  care  (e.g.  implant  of  central  venous catheter, routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication not associated with any deterioration in condition)

The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied indication. However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.

A pre-planned hospitalization for a condition which existed at the start of study drug and which did not worsen  during  the  course  of  study  drug  treatment  (e.g  scans,  endoscopy,  sampling  for  laboratory tests…).However, hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for a complication of such procedures remains a reportable SAE.

Social admission (e.g., subject has no place to sleep; hospice facilities)

Administrative admission (e.g., for yearly physical examinations)

Protocol-specified admission during a clinical trial (e.g., for a procedure required by the study protocol or for clinical research)

Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (e.g., for elective cosmetic surgery)

## Exposure to drug during pregnancy/lactation

In principle, pregnancy and the lactation period are exclusion criteria. In the event of a pregnancy occurring during the course of the study, the subject must be withdrawn from the study immediately. The pharmacovigilance unit must be notified  immediately  and  the  subject  followed  during  the  entire  course  of  the  pregnancy  and  postpartum  period. Parental  and  neonatal  outcomes  must  be  recorded  even  if  they  are  completely  normal  and  without  AEs.  The 'Pregnancy report from should be used.

If  the  investigator  obtains  any  late  information,  after  the  patient  has  left  the  clinical  trial,  he  will  inform Pfizer  by spontaneous reporting.

## Recording of adverse events

## When to collect AEs

Any AE that occurs from the time consent is given, during the study and in the 30 days following the last administration of study treatment should be recorded.

All subjects should be monitored for AEs during the study. Assessments may include monitoring of any or all of the following  parameters:  the  subject's  clinical  symptoms,  laboratory,  pathological,  radiological  or  surgical  findings, physical examination findings, or other appropriate tests and procedures.

## What AE to collect

All observed AE regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to study drug will be assessed following NCI-CTCAE version 4.0 and recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF, and in the case of a serious adverse event will also be recorded on a SAE form.

All SAEs must be reported immediately by fax of the SAE Report Form to the pharmacvigilance Unit of the coordinating sponsor (see section 10.4)

An overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE, or abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational medicinal product should be reported as an AE. If an overdose is associated with an AE, the overdose and adverse event should be reported as separate terms.

In the event of overdose or exaggerated response, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and  experience of the treating physician.

Worsening/exacerbation of sign and symptoms (in terms of severity and/or frequency, or the appearance of new manifestations/complications) of the malignancy under study or of a pre-existing illness should be reported as an AE in the appropriate section of the CRF.

Lack of or insufficient clinical response, benefit, efficacy, therapeutic effect, or pharmacological action, should not be recorded as an AE. The investigator must make the distinction between  exacerbation of pre-existing illness and lack of therapeutic efficacy.

In addition, clinically significant changes in physical examination findings and abnormal objective test findings (e.g., xray, ECG) should also be recorded as AEs. The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE are as follows:

test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other therapy, and/or test result leads to any of the outcomes included in the definition of a SAE, and/or test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or sponsor.

If  an  abnormal  laboratory  value  is  associated  with  a  diagnosis  or  clinical  signs/symptoms,  the diagnosis or sign/symptom  should  be  reported  as  an  AE  and  the  associated  laboratory  result  should  be considered additional information to support the diagnosis.

For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SAE requiring immediate  notification  to  IGR,  sufficient information  should  be  obtained  by  the  investigator  to  determine the causality of the AE (i.e., study drug or other illness). The investigator is required to assess  causality  and  indicate  that  assessment  on  the  CRF.  All  AEs  and specially  those  that  are  serious, suspected to be related to study drug or considered significant by the investigator or clinical monitor must be followed after the time of therapy discontinuation until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator and the clinical monitor or his/her designated representative. All AEs will be recorded in the CRF.

## Severity assessment

For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity of the event.

The severity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject's symptoms according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE, Version 4.0); http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html.

AEs that are not defined in the NCI CTCAE should be evaluated for severity according to the following scale:

Grade  1  =  Mild  -  transient  or  mild  discomfort;  no  limitation  in  activity;  no  medical  intervention/therapy required

Grade 2 = Moderate - mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed;  no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required

Grade 3 = Severe -marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization is possible

Grade 4  = Life  threatening -  extreme  limitation  in  activity,  significant  assistance  required;  significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable

The term 'severe' is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache). This criterion is not the same as 'serious' which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria associated with events that pose a threat to a subject's life or functioning.

Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining regulatory obligations.

## Causality assessment

The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of IMP and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not related or related as defined below:

Not related: The  temporal  relationship  of  the  adverse  event  to  IMP administration  makes a  causal relationship unlikely  or remote , or other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.

Related: The temporal relationship of the adverse event to IMP administration makes a causal relationship possible ,  and  other  medications,  therapeutic  interventions,  or  underlying  conditions  do  not  provide  a  sufficient explanation for the observed event.

If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IMP that has not been manufactured or provided by The Promotor, please provide the name of the manufacturer when reporting the event.

## Duration

The Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the AE/SAE.

The duration of the AE and the SAE may vary within one event. For example, a non-serious AE may  begin on 01-Jan. The event will become serious when it meets one of the criteria for seriousness (e.g.,  the subject is hospitalized on 05-Jan). The  SAE  will  continue  until  it  no  longer  meets  the  seriousness  criteria  (e.g.,  the  subject  is  discharged  on  07-Jan). However, the AE continues until 10-Jan when the event resolves. The AE dates may extend from before and beyond the SAE dates, but not the reverse.

## Action Taken

The Investigator will report the discontinuation or reduction of IMP following an AE and report if concomitant and/or additional treatments were given for the AE.

## Outcome

All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study must be followed until recovered, recovered with sequelae, not recovered (death due to another cause) or death (due to the SAE).

## Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events

All Serious Adverse Events (SAE), related or not to study drugs, occurring at any time during the study (since consent is given) and through 30 days after the last administration of study drugs, independent of the circumstances or suspected cause, must be reported, immediately by fax.

The investigator must fill in the SAE Form in English and assess the relationship to study drugs, then send it signed and dated, immediately, even if it does not appear to be treatment-related, to the:

## Pharmacovigilance unit Fax : +33 (0) 1 42 11 61 50

Phone : 33 (0)1 42 11 61 00

(9 a.m. - 6 p.m. from Monday to Friday, except on bank holidays)

E-mail: phv@gustaveroussy.fr

Any  late  Serious  Adverse  Drug  Reaction  (SADR),  occurring  after  this  30-day  period  also  must  be  reported  to  the Pharmacovigilance Unit.

Information collected in the SAE form is crucial to assess the case. For this reason, diligences in collecting as much verifiable and reliable information are needed: both, quality and timliness are key factors. If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than  its individual symptoms. The following information should be captured for all SAEs: onset, duration, intensity, seriousness, relationship to study drugs, action taken and treatment required.

The investigator must also attach the following wherever possible:

- a copy of the summary of hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization
- a copy of the post-mortem report (if applicable)
- a copy of all relevant laboratory examinations and the dates on which these examinations were carried out, including relevant negative results as well as normal laboratory ranges

all other document that are judged useful and relevant  All these documents will remain anonymous.

Follow-up information

The investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical follow-up of patients until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event or until the patient's death. This may mean that follow-up should continue once the patient has left the trial.  Follow  up  information  about  a  previously  reported  SAE  must be reported by the investigator to the Pharmacovigilance  Unit  immediately  after  becoming aware of it, on the serious adverse event report form, by ticking the  box  marked  'Follow-up  N°…'.  The  investigator  also  transmits  the  final  report  at  the  time  of  resolution  or stabilization of the SAE. The investigator retains the documents concerning the supposed serious adverse event so that previously transmitted information can be completed if necessary.

Emergency unblinding by the investigator

Investigators are reminded that the unblinding of trial treatment should not necessarily be triggered  by the occurrence of a serious adverse event. Unblinding of trial treatment may be required in emergency situations (e.g life-threatening event..) if the knowledge of the administered product is necessary for the patient's treatment. When trial treatment is accidentally or intentionally  received by a person other than the trial participants, unblinding may also be warranted.

The unblinding procedure will be performed centrally and the request should be initiated by  the  investigators.  The investigator  should  inform  the  Sponsor,  who  is  available  24h/24,  7d/7,  365 d/year as follows:

From Monday to Friday (except on bank holidays), between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.: the safety manager Salim Laghouati should be contacted on + 33 (0) 1.42.11.61.00

In his absence, after hours (i.e. between 6 p.m and 9 am), during weekends and on bank holidays, please call the pharmacy department on + 33 (0)1 42 11 55 27.

Within 24 hours after the treatment code has been broken, the investigator must send:

the Treatment unblinding request form dated and signed, by fax at +33 (0) 1 42 11 60 70

(appendix 13)

The SAE report form, dated and signed, by fax at +33 (0) 14 22 11 61 50 (appendix 14)

In the event of emergency, the PI and/or pharmacist at the investigating centre  is  allowed to unblind the trial treatment without prior authorisation. However,  the Sponsor should still be notified within 24 hours. Furthermore, In the event of a code break, the name of the code breaker, the signature, date and time needs to be recorded on the outside of the envelope.

## The adverse drug reactions (ADR) listed below require study drug discontinuation (until resolution)  and appropriate medical management

Grade 3-4 cardiac toxicity (e.g.; cardiac failure, myocardial infarction, Ejection fraction  decreased &gt;20…)

Grade  3-4  hepatic  or  pancreatic  toxicity  (e.g  acute  hepatic  failure;  cytolytic  hepatitis,  pancreatitis acute; Pancreatitis haemorrhagic; pancreatitis necrotising…)

Grade 3-4 allergic reaction

Grade 4 vascular  disorders  (e.g.;  hypertensive  crisis,  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage,  tumour  haemorrhage, cerebral haemorrhage, Venous thrombosis, embolism…)

The sponsor must be informed within 24h of the occurrence of each of the above mentioned ADRs.

Once the emergency medical management of the above mentioned ADRs has been initiated, the Sponsor's Safety Manager and the Principal Investigator of the study in conjunction with the treating physician will be required to jointly determine whether it would be appropriate to continue treatment with the IMP. During this time, a discussion about the appropriateness of unblinding the trial  treatment may be necessary.

## Responsibilities of the coordinating Sponsor

The Pharmacovigilance Unit at IGR will assess the SAE in terms of seriousness, severity (NCI- CTCAE v4.0), relationship to the study drugs and expectedness (expectedness will be assessed with regard to Investigator Brochure). All SAEs will be coded using MedDRA v13.1

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)

To comply with regulatory requirements, the coordinating sponsor will notify all national sponsors of  all SAEs that are related  to  the  investigational  medicinal  product  and  unexpected  (i.e.,  not  previously  described  in  the  investigator brochure or in the Summary of Product Charateristics). In the European Union, an event meeting these criteria is referred to as a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR).

In the event that a SUSAR occurs and in compliance with applicable regulations, the subject's treatment code will be unblinded before a report is submitted to Health Authorities, Ethic Committees and investigators.

Once a SUSAR has been confirmed, a CIOMS-1 form will be sent by the Pharmacovigilance Unit of IGR to each national sponsor within 72 hours. Each national sponsor is responsible to report it to the National Ethics committee (if required according to local regulation) and to the national Competent Authority

All SUSAR reports and all reports involving expected SADRs that are fatal will additionally be forwarded to all study Investigators.

The  pharmacovigilance  unit  will  also  send  to  each  national  sponsors  a  quarterly  summary  table  of  the SAE  not considered related to study drug.

## Annual safety report

The pharmacovigilance unit at IGR will issue an annual safety report (ASR) which will be made available to investigators and national sponsors or following a request, throughout the entire duration of the clinical trial.

Each national sponsor will have the responsibility to submit the ASR within 60 days following the data lock (date of the first authorisation of the concerned clinical trial by a competent authority in a member state) to the national competent authority and the national Ethic Committee of the concerned Member States. This procedure should be conducted in accordance with national legislation.

## END OF STUDY

Any patients still on study drug at the time overall survival results become available will be allowed to continue at the discretion of the investigator and provided the criteria for study  drug discontinuation (see Section 7.5 ) are not met. The study will stop 36 months after the randomization of the last patients.

## COMMITTEES AND PANEL REVIEW

## Steering Committee

The steering committee will meet as appropriate to confirm the progression by review of images.

One  report  will  perform  by  the  statistician  as  often  as  steering  committee  occurs,  with  an  overview  of  the  study including the accrual rate and toxicity data.

At the time of RECIST-defined progression, a written request of unblinding could be sent to the steering committee by the investigator. Based on the clinical report summary and appropriate imaging provided by the investigator, the Steering Committee will confirm or not the RECIST- defined progression for unblinding authorisation.

The steering committee will be blinded to treatment arm.

## Independent Data Monitoring Committee

An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) composed of 3 international experts (including one statistician) will monitor the progress of the study on ethical and scientific grounds. The Committee will meet approximately every 1 year (by meeting or conference call).

The role of the IDMC will be:

To review accrual rate

## To monitor toxicity

Every 6 months the pharmacovigilance will circulate a report to the members of the DMC about toxicity. The IDMC will review these interim toxicity data although this is primarily  the responsibility of the study committee. This biannual procedure prevents against problems of major toxicity.

To examine first stage analyses

These interim analyses will remain confidential.

On the basis of these analyses, the IDMC may recommend to the sponsor whether the study should continue or whether it should be changed or terminated prematurely. The sponsor will take the final decision.

To examine other trials

The IDMC will review reports of related studies performed by other groups or organisations to determine whether such information materially affects the aims or preliminary findings of the trial.

## Other

The IDMC may be asked to review a major modification to the study prior to its implementation as a study amendment.

## Centralized imaging review

Progression at baseline and during the study will be assessed by investigators judgment  and confirmed by centralized reading of images.

## ETHICAL AND REGULATORY ASPECTS

This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and will be consistent with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), ICH and local applicable regulatory requirements.

Before the start of the study, the study protocol, informed consent document, and any other appropriate documents will be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable)  for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with local legal requirements.

## Sponsor obligations

Gustave Roussy, France is the sponsor and is the coordinating sponsor for the European countries.  One co-sponsor will be identified in each European participating country.

Each co-sponsor will take care of its own regulatory submissions and its own safety surveillance.

Co-sponsors will be in charge of the patient information notice translation, insurance contracting or  indemnity of the included patients in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements.

All protocol amendments must be agreed upon by the Coordinating/ co-sponsor and must be written  with input from the investigators.

Coordinating/ co-sponsor and investigational sites must archive the entire documents for 15 years.

A  co-sponsorship  agreement  will  be  signed  between  the  coordinating  sponsor  and  each  co-sponsor  with the list of the responsabilities for each party.

## Information and Consent of Participants

Prior to the conduct of any procedure linked to biomedical research, any person  wishing  to participate in a research study  gives  his/her  free,  informed  and  written  consent.  This  consent  is  obtained  once  the  participant  has  been informed by the investigator during a consultation and after  the person had been given sufficient time to think it over.

Having read the information notice, the patient (/parents) must date and sign the consent form if he/she accepts to participate . This consent form must also be signed by the investigator. The original consent  form  must  be  kept  in  the study  file  by  the  investigator  and  the  study  participant  should  receive a copy.

## Investigator Responsibilities

Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations.

The Investigator should ensure that all persons assisting with the study are adequately informed about  the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions. The  Investigator should maintain a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study-related duties.

The Investigator is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent document and are screened for entry into the study. Subjects who fail screening must have the reason(s) recorded in the subject's source documents.

The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator's staff, must be available during  monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (e.g., medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study-related charts) for source data verification. The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.

## DATA COLLECTION

Data will be collected via eCRF and entered into the clinical database per standard SOPs. This data will be electronically verified through use of programmed edit checks specified by the clinical team. Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary. Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database. An audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.

## QUALITY ASSURANCE - MONITORING

Quality control and assurance checks will be performed by the sponsor. The trial will be conducted according to regional regulations and according to quality and conduct standart procedures of IGR.

The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, source  documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for audits and inspections by IRB/IECs, regulatory authorities and sponsor authorized representatives.

In order to guarantee the authenticity and the credibility of the data in conformity with good clinical  practices, the Sponsor has installed a quality assurance system which includes:

trial management in accordance with the procedures at Gustave Roussy, quality control of data at the investigating site by CRA,

possible auditing of investigating centres,

Quality control on the site will be ensured by the Sponsor/Co-Sponsor's CRA.  The CRA must check that the investigator's file exists and that it is updated.

The CRA must verify the consent forms, that subjects fulfil eligibility criteria, the  validity  of  evaluation criteria and treatment toxicity with the help of source documents.

The CRA will check drug accountability and ensure that the drug accountability forms are validated  and signed by the in-house pharmacist before any request for destruction.

## DATA OWNERSHIP / PUBLICATION POLICY

The investigator promises, on his/her behalf as well as that of all the persons involved in the conduct of the trial, to guarantee the confidentiality of all the information provided by Gustave Roussy until the publication of the results of the trial.

All  publications,  abstracts  or  presentations  including  the  results  of  the  trial  require  prior  approval  of  the  Sponsor (Gustave Roussy).

All oral presentations, manuscripts must include a rubric mentioning the Sponsor, the investigators / institutions that participated in the trial, the cooperative groups, learned societies which contributed  to the conduct of the trial and the bodies which funded the research.

The Coordinating Investigator will write an article reporting on the results as soon as possible after the final analysis and will be the first author of the publication.

The results of this study may be published in a medical publication, journal, or may be used for teaching purposes. Additionally, this study and its results may be submitted for inclusion in all appropriate health authority study registries, as well as publication on health authority study registry websites, as required by local health authority regulations.

On behalf of all participating investigators the National Coordinators of the FIRSTMAPPP trial agree  on the following publication policy:

Independent of the outcome of the study, in addition to the reports to the Health Authorities  and Ethics Committees, the results will be made open to the public.

It  is  intended  to  publish  the  results  of  the  trial  as  well  as  derived-studies  in  international  peer-  reviewed journals.

In addition, the results will also be presented at national and international meetings.

Any publication of results of the FIRSTMAPPP trial (including analysis not yet foreseen in the protocol) has to be approved by the Protocol Committee and the Statistician  Irrespective of authorship, all Investigators will be informed and given the opportunity to comment on the draft at least 4 weeks before submitting any manuscript or abstract.

The authorship will mirror the contribution to the trial in terms of the number of patients that have been included by each centre. The statistician will be at the 5 th place and the imaging reviewer as 9th. In addition national coordinators and coordinators of centers that have  enrolled more than 10 % of the total number of patients will be cited too. In case one centre enrolls a significant number of patients 2 names of the centre may be cited in the final publication

Publications in the field of translational research are anticipated in order to  look  for  predictors of response and  surrogate  markers  of  tumor  response  :  leaders  in  the  field  of  hormones  ,  genetics,  cardiovascular management , scintigraphic imaging, conventional imaging, biomarkers ….are prespecified that will be in charge of conducting each of them

For the publication of the results of the primary objectives of FIRSTMAPPP the order is predefined in the following  order  acknowledging  the  contribution  to  establish  the  FIRSTMAPPP  trial  (see  detailed  list  of contributions below):

PI

1rst  of  second  (if  PI  is  first)  recruiter  who  can  also  be  considered  senior  author  according to his / her preference

Second or third recruiter

Third or fourth recruiter

Centralized Imaging reviewer as fifth

All investigator (if not already cited) according to the number of patients enrolled (if

&gt;10%)

Radiologist as seventh

Pathologist as ninth

FP7 chair

Centralized Imaging reviewer

'Sub-senior author': Statisticician

'Senior author': First or second recruiter if PI  is first recruiter

All participating investigators will be acknowledged in any publication of the primary objectives of FIRSTMAPPP. The name of the participating  institution  and  the  number  of  patients that  the  institution  recruited  to  the  trial  will  be mentioned.

In case of an equivalent number of patients enrolled, the number of queries generated and the number of paraffin blocks retrieved will be taken into account.

For  the  publication  of  the  results  of  the  translational  research  (TR)  studies  of  FIRSTMAPPP  the  order  is predefined in the following order acknowledging the contribution to establish the FIRSTMAPPP-TR derived trials.

It is anticipated that the members of the Protocol Committee will be primarily responsible for analyzing the results and writing the manuscript drafts. However, if additional investigators contribute significantly in this process, this will be considered in an appropriate manner.

Every contributor of any FIRSTMAPPP-derived publications has to approve the final version of the respective manuscript.

## VISUAL ANALOG BONE PAIN SCALE

A V isual A nalog Bone Pain S cale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure bone pain that is believed to range across a continuum from none to an extreme amount of pain.

From  the  patient's  perspective  this  spectrum  appears  continuous  (their  pain  does  not  take  discrete  jumps,  as  a categorization  of  none,  mild,  moderate  and  severe  would  suggest).  It  was  to  capture  this  idea  of  an  underlying continuum that the VAS was devised.

Operationally a VAS is usually a horizontal line,  100  mm  in  length,  anchored  by  word  descriptors  at  each  end,  as illustrated below. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimetres from the left hand end of the line to  the point that the patient marks.

## APPENDIX  4 -Recommendations for management of blood pressure,  proteinuria, heart and kidney dysfunction during antiangiogenic therapy

## PF Plouin HEGP

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors expose to cardiac, vascular and renal toxicity that is directly related to the antagonism of VEGF cardiovascular and renal effects. Cardiac toxicity and severe hypertension are serious concerns in patients with PH/PGL who frequently have baseline hypertension and can suffer chronic or acute cardiomyopathy in relation with catecholamine excess. A rise in BP can happen very  early with an On/Off effect during the first days of active treatment and during periods of drug wash- out. Renal toxicity is mostly documented in patients with metastatic renal cancer, in whom the decrease  in  glomerular  filtration  rate  (GFR)  and  the  risk  of  nephrotic-range  proteinuria  is  enhanced  by nephrectomy. However, tyrosine kinase inhibitors are expected to improve survival, making renal toxicity a concern in the long term in patients with PH/PGL and normal kidneys at baseline.

There is therefore a need to screen patients with metastatic PH/PGL for hypertension and cardiac/renal  dysfunction before  inclusion  in  a  trial  of  antiangiogenic  therapy  and  to  monitor  BP,  renal and cardiac function during active (antiangiogenic or control) treatment. Besides, patients with malignant hypertension, unstable angina, decompensated heart failure or progressive renal failure and  those  with  a  history  of  stroke,  coronary  revascularization,  myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism in the previous 6 months should not be included.

## Left ventricular mass and function monitoring

Patients  will  undergo  echocardiography  with  determination  of  left  ventricular  mass  and  left  ventricular  ejection fraction (LVEF) before inclusion. Patients with an LVEF of 55% or less should  be provided medication (including ACE inhibitors  and  diuretics)  with  the  goal  of  raising  LVEF  to  55%  or  more.  During  active  treatment,  LVEF  should  be determined after 3 and 6 months or in case of  new cardiac symptoms. Active treatment should be discontinued if LVEF is 45% or less despite adequate cardiovascular medication.

## BP monitoring

Patients will undergo 24-hour BP monitoring at baseline to detect or quantify paroxysmal  or sustained hypertension . Hypertensive  patients (i.e.  patients  with  a  24-hour  average  BP  of  125/80  mmHg  or  more) should  be  provided antihypertensive therapy including alpha- blockers, ACE inhibitors, AT 1 or calcium antagonists (excluding verapamil and diltiazem), and if necessary beta- blockers, with the goal of reducing office BP at 160/95 mmHg for inclusion before starting active treatment. Patients with or without baseline hypertension should be provided a home BP monitor and instructed to determine BP three times in the morning and three times in the evening during the last seven days of treatment cycles for the first three months of active treatment. In case of systolic BP exceeding 160 mmHg or of a rise in systolic BP exceeding 20 mmHg, they should contact the trial physician to adapt antihypertensive treatment. Active treatment should be reduced or discontinued if systolic BP exceeds 160 mmHg despite maximum antihypertensive medication.

## Renal monitoring

GFR (using the MDRD formula) and urinary protein excretion (using dipstick then quantification if 2+ or more) will be determined at baseline at the end of each cycle. Nephrologic advice will be required for patients with a GFR &lt;30 ml/min or with a urinary protein excretion exceeding 1 g/l. In case  of  a  reduction  in  GFR  by  20%  or  more  or  of  a  rise  in urinary  protein  to  3  g/l  or  more  during active  treatment,  patients  should  be  referred  to  a  nephrologist  and/or active  treatment  should  be  reduced or discontinued.

## Discontinuation of active treatment

Active treatment should be discontinued in case of

Stroke, congestive heart failure, unstable angina or myocardial infarction

Malignant hypertension with retinal hemorrhages ans exudates and or papilledema or posterior  reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

Thrombotic microangiopathy, severe progressive renal failure or poorly tolerated nephrotic  syndrome

## APPENDIX 5 - Drugs contraindication

## Contra-indicated drugs in patients with pheochromocytoma (patient safety)

Dopamine  receptor  D2  antagonists such  as  Metoclopramide  (antiemetic),  Sulpiride  (antipsychotic), Amisulpride  (antipsychotic),  Amisulpride  (antipsychotic),  Chlorpromazine  (antipsychotic  and  antiemetic), Prochlorperazine (antipsychotic and antiemetic), Droperidol (Antipsychotic, antiemetic used in anesthesia), Veralipride (Menopausal symptoms)

Non cardio-selective  beta-adrenergic  receptor  blockers without  sufficient  alpha-adrenoceptor  blockade: includes Propranolol, Penbutolol, Timolol, Nadolol, Sotalol, Labetolol.

## Caution with

Peptide hormones &amp; analogues: Adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH), Glucagon, Saralasin

Steroids (in high doses as used for testing adrenal insufficiency or treating inflammatory  disorders): Dexamethasone, Betamethasone, Prednisone, Methylprednisolone, Hydrocortisone

Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants such as Imipramine,  Desipramine, Amitriptyline, Clomipramine

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors at high doses, such as Paroxetine and Fluoxetine

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as Tranylcypromine, Phenylzine and Moclobemide - but also  Deprenyl (Selegiline) at high doses

Sympathomimetics: Pseudoephedrine Ephedrine, Phenylpropanolamine, Diethylpropion, Fenfluramine, Phenteramine, Dexamfetamine, Salbutamol, Terbutaline, Terbutaline, Amphetamine,  Cocaine

Opioid  analgesics (only  used  with  caution):  Meperidine,  thiopentone,  nalbuphine,  pethidine, morphine, diamorphine (adverse reactions linked to histamine-releasing properties).

## Inductors and Inhibitors of CYP3A4

Potent inhibitors: ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, delavirdine, indinavir, saquinavir, ritonavir, atazanavir, nelfinavir, nefazodone,  voriconazole, and telithromycin.

Potent  inducers  (rifampin,  rifabutin,  carbamazepine,  phenobarbital,  phenytoin,  St.  John's  wort,  efavirenz, tipranavir

## APPENDIX 6 - Translational research

1. Pathology: Standard Operating Procedures for Collection and Analysis of Pathology Data

## Background

The current roles of pathology in management of pheochromocytomas and extra-adrenal paragangliomas are limited to diagnosis, documentation of malignant behavior and recording of findings that may be clues to occult hereditary disease  [1].  It  is  anticipated  that  future  roles  will  include  improved  assessment  of  malignant  potential,  genotypephenotype correlation and identification of targets for therapy. Data for the trial will therefore be collected in a manner that will permit refinement of pathology analysis on the basis of prospectively accrued data. According to the current WHO classification, malignancy is defined by the presence of metastases to a site where paraganglionic tissue is not normally present, e.g., liver or bone, in order to avoid confusion with multiple primary tumors [2]. Local invasion per se is by WHO definition not diagnostic of malignancy but may be important as a component of multi-parameter scoring systems and should be precisely documented.

Diagnosis  of  primary  or  metastatic  pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma  is  usually  possible  on  the  basis of routine histology. However, that is not always the case, especially where other types of neuroendocrine tumors are diagnostic possibilities. The trial will therefore require diagnostic consensus between pathologists and availability of at least one representative  paraffin  block  for  immunohistochemical  stains  as  required.  Staining  for  keratins  (usually  absent  or minimal in pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma) and tyrosine hydroxylase (usually positive in pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma) are usually sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Composite tumors consisting of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma  plus  ganglioneuroma  or  ganglioneuroblastoma  are  occasionally  encountered. Most evidence suggests that these tumors do not behave much differently from pure pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma  [2],  and  there  is  currently  no  precise  stipulation  of  what  percentage  of ganglioneuroma or ganglioneuroblastoma is required to define a composite tumor. Patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma plus ganglioneuroma or ganglioneuroblastoma are therefore included in the trial. The pathology documentation will include  an estimated percentage of mixed elements, to be taken into consideration during outcome analysis. Patients with other, extremely rare, composite or mixed tumors (e.g. pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma plus malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor or cortical carcinoma) are excluded from the trial.

## Logistics in Brief

For  every  patient  enrolled  in  the  trial,  slides  and  a  representative  block  from  the  primary  tumor  and  a metastasis will be requested from the institution where the diagnosis was originally made and will be sent to Dr. Ronald de Krijger, the coordinating pathologist of the trial, in order to confirm the diagnosis. Optimally, all slides should be sent. If this is against institutional policy, representative slides and the representative block should be selected to include areas of capsular and vascular invasion and tumor necrosis, if present.

The  oncologist  or  a  designated  clinical  trial  coordinator  at  the  center  where  the  patient  is  enrolled  is responsible for requesting that the slides and block be sent, together with the institutional pathologist's report (including diagnosis and gross description), patient identification (labeled using a  standardized coding

system), contact information of the Dept. of Pathology where the diagnosis was made, and annotation as to the availability of frozen tissue from primary tumors or metastases.

Slides will be scanned and put on a central server, to be arranged by the study coordinator. Subsequently, after review, they will be returned to the originating pathology department.

One block of the primary tumour and one from a metastasis if available (preferably not from bone)  will be kept in a central repository.

The oncologist of the center where the patient was enrolled, the study coordinator, and the submitting pathologist will be notified of the review result.

Initially review will consist of confirmation of the diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma by the trial pathologists, one of whom will perform any required immunohistochemical studies. The trial pathologists will if necessary consult using the scanned images.

Further  analyses  of  the  digitized  images  and  paraffin  sections  will  be  performed  later  on  in  the  study, following agreement on studies to be performed (to be decided at the half yearly meetings of the study group) and establishment of precisely defined methodology. Analyses will include the components of the PASS score and a MIB1 labeling index.

In the case of death of a trial patient, a request for autopsy will be done by the treating oncologist, depending on the local guidelines. This will be performed by the local pathologist, who can consult the trial pathologists.

APPENDIX 7 - Standard Operating Procedures for Collection, Storage, and  Shipping of Biological Specimens

## Background

Biochemical  markers  of  catecholamine  excess  to  be  utilized  as  surrogate  markers  of  tumor  burden  include measurements  in  plasma  of  catechols  (dopamine,  noradrenaline,  adrenaline,  3,4-  dihydroxyphenylglycol,  3,4dihydroxyphenylalanine,  3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic  acid)  and  the  O- methylated  catecholamine  metabolites  (3methoxytyramine, normetanephrine and metanephrine), all in their free form. Analytes measured in urine include fractionated deconjugated metanephrines (normetanephrine and metanephrine), catechols (as detailed above), and vanillymandelic  acid (VMA). Measurements of plasma chromogranin A (CgA) provide an additional marker of tumor burden, independent of catecholamine synthesis.

Levels of the O-methylated metabolites reflect the size of catecholamine stores and show strong positive relationships with  tumor  size. 1,2 .  The  combined  measurements  of  methoxytyramine,  normetanephrine  and  metanephrine  can therefore be expected to provide the most accurate surrogate markers of tumor burden. Due to fluctuations and wideranging differences in secretion,  measurements of catecholamines have limited value as markers of tumor burden, but are  useful  for  correlation  with  the  clinical  presentation  of  patients.  CgA  is  subject  to  the  same  limitations,  but  is nevertheless useful as a surrogate marker for occasional rare tumors (and/or metastases) that do not synthesize or produce, secrete and metabolize catecholamines.

All  markers  of  catecholamine  excess  are  measured  by  HPLC  with  electrochemical  or  coulometric  detection. 3,4 Measurements  of  plasma  CgA  are  by  enzyme  immunoassay  using  a  commercial  ELISA  Kit  method  (K0025,  Dako Denmark).

Measurements  are  carried  out  in  an  accredited  diagnostic  laboratory.  FDA-compliant  procedures  are  utilized  for measurements of urinary and plasma catechols.

Logistics in Brief

All participating centers to collect, store, and ship biological specimens (i.e., plasma,  urine) according to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) outlined here.

Centers may collect blood and 24-hour urine samples using their own preferred collection containers, but in accordance with  all  other  outlined  SOPs  for  specimen  collection,  and  using  the  stipulated  preservatives  and  anti-coagulants. Aliquots of plasma and urine for analysis of tumor markers are stored in stardardized polypropylene tubes suitable for centrifugation, storage at -80 o C, and shipping on dry ice (5 mL SARSTEDT P/N 60.558, or equivalent; 1.8 mL for CgA). Specimen storage tubes are supplied to all participating centers by the sponsor, and coded or labeled for specimen type (e.g., plasma, urine) and analytes for measurements (e.g., CgA, metanephrines, catecholamines).

Specimen storage tubes should be labeled using a standardized coding system (e.g., a bar-coding system according to that routinely employed by the Sponsor) that enables identification of the  participating center, patient, and particular sample (including sampling date) according to the design of the trial.

Specimens are stored in duplicate by participating centers, one of the pairs of specimens retained as a backup and the other shipped to the central laboratory for analysis. Specimen storage is at -80 o C following standard GLP procedures (e.g., alarmed and documented freezers, inventory systems in place, availability of back-up freezer).

All specimens are shipped frozen on dry ice in a suitable container approved for the purpose.  Specimens are shipped to the central laboratory (see address and contact information below) with enough time to ensure delivery before the end of the work-week. A member of the laboratory staff is contacted (phone or email) before shipping and confirms receipt of all inventoried samples in the shipment. Shipments are accompanied by an inventory of the samples in both standardized hard copy and electronic form (e.g., CD-rom containing a standardized spreadsheet derived from the barcoding  system). The spreadsheet includes all necessary data required for sample processing and data reporting (e.g., 24 hour urine volumes, dates of collections). The central laboratory utilizes the spreadsheet for inventory purposes, sample processing, data reporting, and compiling of final datasets  for analyses.

## APPENDIX 8 - Modality of genetic screening

Prof. Anne-Paule Gimenez-Roqueplo

## Background

Twelve to thirty percent of pheochromocytoma and/or paraganglioma are genetically determined. Several familial diseases  are  known  to  include  pheochromocytoma  and/or  paraganglioma 1,2 .  The  SDH-hereditary  paraganglioma caused by germline mutation in mitochondrial tumor  suppressor  genes SDHD , SDHB or SDHC . The von Hippel Lindau disease due to loss of function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene VHL . The multiple endocrine neoplasia type II induced by germline  activating  mutations  in  the RET proto-oncogene.  The  neurofibromatosis  type  1  caused  by mutations  in the NF1 gene. It is established that the presence of a germline SDHB mutation is a predictive factor  of malignancy in a patient operated on a pheochromocytoma or a paraganglioma, and in addition of poor prognosis in a patient with a metastatic pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma 3,4 .

It is now clear that a genetic testing must be proposed to patients with malignant pheochromocytoma and/or malignant paraganglioma 1-7 . Because around 9% of SDHx mutations are large chromosomal rearrangements, SDHB gene should be screened in first by direct sequencing to detect punctual mutations as well as by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and/or by quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF) to detect large genomic deletions. Usually MLPA is used to screen the three SDHx genes in a single test and QMPSF is performed to validate the findings 5 .

In case of negative SDHB genetic test, genetic testing may be targeted by the clinical work-up, the family pedigree and the result of SDHB-immunohistochemistry 8 . Clinical clues could be search in favour of a syndromic disease or family history but in absence of evidence, VHL , SDHD and SDHC genes should be also analyzed.

## Logistics:

All  participating  centers  should  propose  genetic  testing  with  a  procedure  in  accordance  with  the  national  ethical guidelines. A specific informed consent for the genetic testing should be signed by  the patient and the physician.

The direct sequencing of the pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma susceptibility genes may be either performed in a local genetic laboratory or centralized in the central genetic laboratory. A negative genetic testing or the identification of a mutation may be confirmed by the central genetic laboratory.

In  the  case  of  a  negative SDHB screening,  the  search  for  large  chromosomal  rearrangement  should  be  realized  or confirmed in using a second technique, by the central genetic laboratory.

15µg  DNA  (concentration  ≥100  ng/ml),  or  15  ml  of  total  blood  collected  on  EDTA,  should  be  shipped at room temperature to the central genetic laboratory with a signed copy of the consent form.

To assess the functionality of an unknown variant, frozen tumor (succinate dehydrogenase enzymatic assay), tumoral DNA (loss of heterozygosity) or RNA (splice mutation), tumor paraffin slides or blocks (SDHB immunohistochemistry) could be asked by the central laboratory.

## APPENDIX 9 - Modality of conventional imaging for staging

Clarisse Dromain, head of radiology department Gustave Roussy Villejuif FRANCE

## BACKGROUND

The diagnosis of malignancy of Pheochromocytomas (PH) and Paraganglomas (PG) is made on the basis of the presence of involved lymph nodes or distant metastases rather than the histological findings. The main sites of metastases are the  lymph  nodes  (70%),  the  bone  (69%),  the  liver  (46%),  the  lung  (39%)  and  other  (&lt;10%)  (1).  The  proportion  of metastatic lymph nodes is even more important for primary head and neck than for abdominal PH and PG. The spine and pelvis are the most common bone metastatic sites, due to the presence of red (haematopoietic active) bone marrow in a high amount.

CT examinations has a high sensitivity about 90% for depicting primary tumors and metastatic and extra-adrenal lesions above  1cm  in  diameter  (2-3).  The  underlying  hypervascularity  of  the  primary  tumor  and  metastases  results  in homogeneous and intense enhancement following intravenous administration of contrast material.

AIM

Assessment of treatment (Time To Progression) using RECIST criteria.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

A CT or MR examination the neck, the chest, the abdomen and the pelvis , is mandatory for the assessment of both lymph nodes extension and metastasis.

A liver MRI is recommended in addition to abdominal CT examination in cases for which CT examination is not sufficient for an accurate evaluation of liver metastases.

A  whole  body  or  spine  MRI is  the  imaging  modality  of  choice  for  the  detection  of  bone  metastases  and  for demonstrated spinal  canal  narrowing  and  metastatic  cord  compression.  However  MRI  is  not  an  accurate  imaging method for the assessment of bone metastases and should be recommended only in cases of symptomatic disease.

To  ensure  comparability  between  examinations  and  measurements,  identical  imaging  parameters  must be used for baseline and following imaging timepoints.

IMAGING PROTOCOL

## CT examination

A slice thickness ≤ 5mm is required

Contrast volume and concentrations are based on patients weght and lab results . Intravenous contrast  agent (nonionic) shall be administered via a canula that will allow a 2cc/s using a power injector

To minimize radiation exposure only an enhanced CT should be perform (Unenhanced CT recommended for initial staging to increase the specificity of CT in the characterization of an adrenal tumor is not required for assessment of treatment)

An acquisition at the arterial phase ( » 30 s after the initiation of contrast material) is recommended on the abdomen because it increases the sensibility of detection of liver metastases.

Following acquisition at the venous phase (70-90s) after the initiation of contrast is mandatory on the neck, the chest, the abdomen and the pelvis .

Whole body or spine or MRI : The recommended pulse sequences should at least includes a  unenhanced T1 weighted sequence, a fat suppressed T2 weighted sequence. Additional enhanced fat suppressed T1 weighted and diffusion MR images could be acquired.

Liver MRI : The recommended pulse sequences should at least included a T1 weighted sequence, a fat suppressed T2 weighted sequence and dynamic 2D or 3D SPGR sequences with acquisition at the arterial phase. Additional diffusion MR images with high b value from 600 to 1000 are also recommended but optional.

Images analysis

Images  will  be  analyzed  using  the  new  RECIST  criteria  1.1  more  appropriate  for  the  assessment  of  lymph node assessment(4)

## APPENDIX 10 - Approach to functional imaging

Henri Timmers, Dept. of Endocrinology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, the  Netherlands

## Rationale

Functional  imaging  is  widely  used  for  the  localization  of  (metastases  of)  paraganglioma  (PGL).  Besides  123Imetaiodobenzylguanidine  (MIBG)  scintigraphy,  novel  positron  emission  tomography  (PET)  tracers  such  as  18Ffluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), 18F-fluorodopamin and 18F- fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine are being successfully applied in PGL. 18F-FDG PET serves as biomarker of tumor cell viability and proliferative activity, and is currently being validated for use as cancer clinical trial end-point in a wide range of malignancies 1 . In the specific setting of PGL, 18F- FDG PET provides a high sensitivity for the detection of metastases, especially in carriers of  underlying germline SDHB -gene mutations 2 , and is superior to 123I-MIBG scintigraphy.

Although 18F-FDG PET is currently considered the best and most widely available functional  imaging  modality  for localizing metastatic PGL, there are no validated criteria for judging response  to therapy using this technique.

## Aim

To assess the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET as a tool for assessing response to therapy in metastatic  paraganglioma in the context of FIRSTMAPPP.

## Approach

18F-FDG PET/CT is performed at the participating centers as part of baseline (pre-treatment) and 3- monthly follow-up evaluations.  A  uniform  scanning  protocol  based  on  European  Organization  for  Research  and  Treatment  of  Cancer (EORTC) 3 and National Cancer Institute (NCI) 4 recommendations  is applied across centers, using identical equipment and settings for follow-up scans in individual patients:

## Patient preparation

Patients fast at least 4 h. Venous serum glucose concentration is measured before injection and is preferrably &lt;120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) for nondiabetic patients and 150-200 mg/dL (8.3-11.1 mmol/L)  for  diabetic  patients.  Diabetic patients  are  scanned  in  morning  after  overnight  fast  and  before first use of medication. Patients are well hydrated before scanning. Patient will void prior to positioning with arms up if tolerated. Height, weight and all medications being taken by patients are recorded.

## PET timing

Pretreatment scans are acquired as close to start of therapy as possible (preferably &lt;2 wk). Posttreatment scans are acquired no sooner than 2 wk after end of chemotherapy (if applicable) to avoid transient increases or decreases. Timing is determined by endpoint being assessed. Imaging begins 60 ±10 min after injection of 18F-FDG.

## Attenuation correction

CT  will  be  used  for  attenuation  correction  as  per  clinical  routine,  typically  120-140kVP  and  80  mA.  Attenuation corrections with pin sources is acceptable in accordance with manufacture's recommendation. CT co-registration with PET cannot serve as anatomical scanning for RECIST measurements.

## 18F-FDG dose and image acquisition

No standard dose has yet been recommended. Doses of 370-740 MBq (10-20 mCi) are appropriate. Dose injected and time is documented. Scanning will start at proximal thigh and go up to the vertex  of the skull. Images may be acquired in 2D or 3D mode according to the manufactures instructions. Acquisition time per level is at least 3 minutes for 15- 20 mCi dose and 5 minutes for 10 mCi dose.

Analysis is performed using iterative reconstruction as per manufacturer suggestion.

## Data analysis

Analysis of 18F-FDG PET data is performed centrally. Scans are read independently by two nuclear physicians who are blinded to clinical and anatomical imaging data. Standardized readings include visual interpretation and semiquantitative indices of tracer uptake for key lesions  (standardized  uptake value normalized for lean body mass) in line with NCI consensus recommendations 4 . 18F- FDG PET criteria for response to cancer treatment as put forward by the EORTC 3 will be applied and  validated against RECIST criteria, biochemical data and clinical parameters.

## APPENDIX 11 - RECIST 1.1

http://www.eortc.be/Recist/Default.htm

RECIST Tumor Assessment Criteria

The  determination  of  antitumor  efficacy  during  this  study  will  be  based  on  objective  tumor  assessments  made according to the Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) system  of unidimensional evaluation. A minor modification will be adopted to accommodate standard practice in use of spiral CT scan (i.e., reconstruction interval up to 8 mm).  In the event spiral CT scan is used to assess tumors, minimum lesion size qualifying as measurable will be twice the reconstruction interval used and at least 10 mm.

Measurability of Tumor Lesions

At baseline, individual tumor lesions will be categorized by the investigator as either measurable or  non-measurable by the RECIST criteria as described below.

Measurable: Lesions that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be  recorded) as ³ 20 mm with conventional techniques or as ³ 10 mm with spiral CT scan (depending on  reconstruction interval). Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules, palpable lymph nodes).

Non-Measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions and bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusions, lymphangitis of the skin or lung, abdominal masses  that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, cystic lesions, previously irradiated lesions, and disease documented by indirect evidence only (e.g., by laboratory tests such as alkaline  phosphatase).

NOTE:  If  measurable  disease  is  restricted  to  a  solitary  lesion,  its  neoplastic  nature  should  be confirmed  by cytology/histology.

Recording Tumor Measurements

All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and measured and recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their  size (lesion with the longest diameters) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).

The longest diameter will be recorded for each target lesion. The sum of the longest diameter for all  target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum longest diameter to be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease during treatment.  All measurements should be performed using a caliper or ruler.

All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be  recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as 'present' or 'absent.'

Techniques for Assessing Measurable Disease

The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion  at  screening  and  during  follow-up.  Imaging-based evaluation is  preferred to evaluation by clinical (physical) examination when both methods have been used to  assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.

Definitions of Tumor Response  Target Lesions

Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions.

Partial response (PR) is defined as a ³ 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the  target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.

Progressive disease (PD) is defined as a ³ 20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the  target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions.

Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase  to qualify for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions since the treatment  started.

Non-Target Lesions

Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all non-target lesions.

Incomplete response (SD) is defined as a persistence of ³ 1 non-target lesions.

Progressive disease (PD) is defined as unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the  appearance of ³ 1 new lesions.

The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during  treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to  differentiate between response or stable disease and progressive disease.

Confirmation of Tumor Response

To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements in patients with responding tumors must be confirmed by repeat studies that should be performed ³ 4 weeks after the criteria for  response are first met.

## Determination of Overall Response by the RECIST Criteria

When both target and non-target lesions are present, individual assessments will be recorded separately. The overall assessment of response will involve all parameters as depicted in the table  below.

1 Measurable lesions only.

2 May include measurable lesions not followed as target lesions or non-measurable lesions.

3 Measurable or non-measurable lesions.

The best overall response  is the best response  recorded  from  the start of the treatment  until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

NOTE: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as 'symptomatic  deterioration.' Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When  the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by fine needle aspirate or biopsy before confirming the complete response status.

## Amendments

Initial submission: protocol version 1.1 of 04/26/2011

Amendment 1: Protocol version 2.0 of 09/01/2012

Changes following an article published in the " journal of clinical oncology" which specified that there was a link between Sunitinib and cardiovascular events. As a result, a monitoring has been implemented in the study and cardiac echocardiography may be performed every 3 months during the treatment period, and then during the follow-up period for patients treated with open-label Sunitinib after unblinding.

Amendment 2, April 2014 : Clarification added to the information note and patient consent on the genetic analysis performed during this study. This did not appear clearly in the initial consent.

Amendment 3, January 2016: Amendment to update the Investigator Brochure (IB) for sunitinib (June 2015). Impact on baseline product safety information, no impact on study protocol.

Amendment 4: Protocol version 3.0 of 30/06/2016

Extension of 18 months of the inclusion period (and therefore of the overall duration of the study). The speed of inclusions is in line with that expected but given the delay in the opening of all the centers, an extension of 18 months appeared necessary to complete the inclusions.

Amendment 5, December 2016 : Amendment for the addition of a center (Institut Paoli-Calmettes)

Amendment 6 , January 2018: Amendment to update the Investigator Brochure (IB) for sunitinib (September 2017). No impact on the study protocol.

Amendment 7: Protocol version 4.0 of 04/07/2018

Changes made:

change in the operating methods of the independent monitoring committee: frequency of IDMC meetings from 6 months to 1 year.

increase in the number of patients to be included in the trial in order to obtain a minimum of 37 patients in the Sunitinib arm (i.e. + 4 patients: this increase is not significant compared to the absolute number of patients)

update of the pharmacovigilance section in accordance with the regulations in force.

update of study contacts

## Deviations

The sponsor reviewed Four (4) deviations from the eligibility criteria:

- Three (3) of them were reviewed during central data review meeting : confirmation of the following inclusion criteria ' Progressing  disease  within  18  months  at  imaging  prior  to  randomization  according  to  RECIST'  .    No  subsequent alteration
- The last one was notified by the investigator before inclusion of the patient. A waiver was granted by the Sponsor (exclusion  criteria  :  Hypertension  that  cannot  be  controlled  despite  medications  (&gt;=160/95  mmHg  despite  optimal medical therapy). No subsequent issue was notified

## Abstract

Introduction: Lu-PRRT in neuroendocrine tumors is usually delivered with a total cumulative activity (TCA) of 29.6 GBq, divided into 4 cycles and with /uniFB01 xed interval between cycles (IBCs) of 8 weeks. Based on previous radiobiological studies, reducing IBC could improve ef /uniFB01 cacy without increasing toxicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate safety of Lu-PRRT with two different IBC: intensive (every 5 weeks) or standard (every 8 -10 weeks). Methods: From May 2016 to July 2018, patients with advanced and progressive GEP and bronchial NENs were enrolled in a prospective randomized phase II study. Patients with risk factors for toxicity (RF) were planned for a TCA of 18.5 GBq, patients without RF of 27.8

GBq, divided into 5 cycles. Patients were then randomly assigned to be treated according to the intensive or to the standard IBC. Toxicity was monitored according to CTCAE. Results: Onehundredandtwentypatients (61 in the intensive group and 59 in the standard one) were evaluable for overall toxicity. Five patients (4.1%) had major (G3) hematological toxicity, 2 in the intensive group and 3 in the standard one. Other G3 toxicities related to creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, nausea, and asthenia were observed in the intensive group. 112 patients (54 in the intensive group and 58 in the standard one) performed at least 2 cycles and were also evaluable for cycle-by-cycle toxicity, resulting similar between the two groups. Conclusion: According to our preliminary results, Lu-PRRT administered intensively could be considered as safe as the standard schedule, when TCA is chosen according to the RF. Further data are needed to con /uniFB01 rm these results. © 2024 The Author(s).

## Research Article

## Introduction

Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are heterogeneous tumors, relatively rare, arising from cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system. Two-thirds of them originate in the gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP) tract and account for approximately 1% -2% of all tumors from this site of origin [1]. Based on their cellular morphology and proliferation index (Ki67), they are classi /uniFB01 ed as welldifferentiated grade 1 (G1, Ki67 ≤ 2), grade 2 (G2, Ki67 3 -20%) and grade 3 (G3, Ki67 &gt; 20%) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), and poorly differentiated G3 and neuroendocrine carcinomas [2]. It has been widely demonstrated that the former have a less aggressive behavior than the latter [3]. NENs arising from lung represent 20 -25% of all NETs and are classi /uniFB01 ed as typical (TC) and atypical carcinoids (AC) NETs, large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas and small cell lung carcinomas [4].

Approximately 20% of NETs are metastatic when they are /uniFB01 rst diagnosed [5], so surgery or loco-regional therapies are not feasible. At diagnosis, 20% of the patients are affected by carcinoid syndrome (CS) [6], caused by hypersecretion of hormones and amines, above all serotonin, and mostly represented by /uniFB02 ushing, diarrhea, and carcinoid heart disease.

Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) are considered as the /uniFB01 rst-line systemic therapy for most patients with G1-G2 metastatic well-differentiated GEP NETs. When there is progression disease despite treatment with SSAs, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) should be considered [7]. The phase III trial NETTER-1 demonstrated that in patients with midgut NETs, PRRT with [ 177 Lu]LuDOTA-TATE(Lu-PRRT) plus long-acting octreotide can provide better results in terms of objective response rate, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) when compared to high-dose long-acting octreotide. Regarding NETTER-1 toxicity, grade (G) 3 -4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia occurred in 1%, 2%, and 9%, respectively, of patients in the LuPRRT group as compared with no patients in the control group, with no evidence of renal toxic effects [8]. After NETTER-1 study, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicine Agency (EMA), and Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA) approved Lu-PRRT (Lutathera ® ) for the treatment of advanced, progressive, unresectable or metastatic G1-G2 GEP NETs positive for somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) imaging.

For bronchial NETs, Lu-PRRT is currently being considered as a potential alternative third-line or fourthline therapy for patients who have already been treated with SSA and everolimus [9]. Previous reports have es- tablished the promising role of this therapy in these tumors, with reported disease control rate (DCR) values of 60% [10] and 71.4%, with no signi /uniFB01 cant toxicity [11]. In patients with TC, DCR was also reported as 80% by our previous study on advanced bronchial NETs [4].

According to NETTER-1 trial, Lu-PRRT is delivered at the standard activity of 7.4 GBq/cycle for 4 cycles every 8 weeks, with a total cumulative activity (TCA) of 29.6 GBq. The /uniFB01 xed interval between cycles (IBCs) of 8 weeks is based on the established nadir of acute toxicity, generally 3 -4 weeks after Lu-PRRT, with recovery in the following 4 -6 weeks. In our previous studies, the IBC of 6 -8 weeks was /uniFB01 xed and not modi /uniFB01 ed even in absence of toxicity, too [12, 13].

It has been demonstrated that a longer IBC could reduce the likelihood of tumor control probability (TCP). Conversely, shortening the IBC would have the advantage to reach the minimum effective activity (MEA) at earlier time and may decrease the percentage of surviving cancer cells in the targeted lesions, reduce tumor mass and slow tumor repopulation. This approach could consequently lower the necessary dose to counteract this effect (waste dose) [14].

Following this information, a phase II study was then designed to investigate safety and PFS in patients with somatostatin-positive tumors (basket trial) undergoing two different treatment schedules: intensive (every 5 weeks) or standard (every 8 -10 weeks) for a total of 5 cycles in both groups. Herein, we report the preliminary results on the /uniFB01 rst consecutive patients affected by GEP and bronchial NENs evaluated for overall safety (120) and for cycle-by-cycle safety (112) with 4-month followup after the end of PRRT.

## Materials and Methods

The study was promoted by Istituto Romagnolo per lo Studio dei Tumori ' Dino Amadori ' IRST-, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scienti /uniFB01 co IRCCS Meldola, Italy (IRST) as IRST 100.26. It was registered on the ClinicalTrial.gov website (registration ID: NCT03454763), EudraCT registration number 2015-004727-31. The study was also reviewed and approved by the Ethical Committee on March 16, 2016 (prot. number 1745/2016).

## Study Protocol Objectives

The main objective of the study was to evaluate safety and PFS as co-primary objectives of the two different schedules of Lu-PRRT (intensive and standard). Secondary objectives were to evaluate the DCR, late toxicity,

## Study Population

Patients were referred to our attention by oncologists or multidisciplinary teams. They were considered eligible in the study if they had cytological or histological con/uniFB01 rmation of NETs or any other type of tumors documented as SSTRs positive, with adequate uptake of SSTRs imaging (OctreoScan ® and/or [68Ga]Ga DOTA PET/ CT). Patients should also have measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. Criteria. Furthermore, they should have progression disease in the pre-study period within the last 12 months, adequate hematological, liver, and renal function, life expectancy greater than 6 months and ECOG performance status &lt; 2.

Patients were excluded from the study if they performed chemotherapy and therapeutic radiotherapy within 4 weeks (2 weeks for palliative radiotherapy, hormonal, or biological therapy), if they performed previous PRRT with an adsorbed dose to the kidney of more than 23 Gy and more than 1.8 Gy for the bone marrow, and if they had previous acute toxic effects of any

prior therapy not resolved to a G &lt; 1 according to CTCAE [15]. Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness (e.g., active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations were also excluded.

## Radiobiological Model

The basis of radiobiological model used to design the clinical protocol was already described by Sarnelli et al. [16]. For sake of clarity, a summary of the main issues is reported below.

The model was based:

- on the Jones equation, reported in Figure 1 and which considers TCP as a function of the initial number of clonogenic cells, tumor radiosensitivity, and biological effective dose (BED) [17]. The tumor BED needs to account also for the tumor repopulation occurring during the treatment and its impact on wasting dose. The BED to the kidneys, considered critical organ for Lu-PRRT, is calculated based on the time, varying kidney uptake values, and different kidney masses. To evaluate the effect on the kidneys and potential toxicity, cumulative BED resulting from the IRST model was compared with threshold values reported in the literature [18]. BED after intensive treatment did not exceed threshold values of 40 Gy for patients without RF and 28 Gy for patients with RF;

Fig. 2. Wereported TCP (%) for a tumor mass of 10 g according to different dosage schemes, as derived from the IRST model. It can be noted that the theoretical TCP is always 100% for the schemes using a dosage of 5.5 Gbq/ cycle, regardless of the IBC. On the contrary, for the dosage of 3.7 GBq/cycle, the theoretical TCP decreases slightly as the IBC increases, although remaining high.

- on the activity/cycle. If less activity per cycle is planned, the same TCA can be maintained increasing the number of cycles for example from 4 to 5 [19];

- on previous studies highlighting the importance of RF in establishing TCA [12, 13].

assigned to receive Lu-PRRT at intervals of 5 weeks in the intensive group (arm A with activity of 3.7 GBq/ cycle and arm C with activity of 5.5 GBq/cycle) or of 8 -10 weeks in the standard group (arm B with activity of 3.7 GBq/cycle and arm D with activity of 5.5 GBq/ cycle).

In Figure 2, we reported the TCP according to IRST model and for different Lu-PRRT schemes.

## Study Procedures

Patients were planned to receive a TCA of 18.5 GBq or 27.8 GBq of Lu-PRRT divided into 5 cycles (3.7 GBq/ cycle or 5.5 GBq/cycle, respectively) according to the presence or absence of risk factors for toxicity (RF), which are shown in Table 1. This scheme was also used in previous IRST protocols, whose results were already published [12, 13]. Subsequently, they were randomly

A 1:1 allocation ratio was used; disease site (gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cerebral, other) and tumor grading according to ki-67 (ki-67 &lt; 20% was considered low grade, while ki-67 ≥ 20% was considered high grade) were considered as strati /uniFB01 cation factors. The summary of the study is reported in Figure 3.

vials. Lu-PRRT administration, as well as patient ' s preparation, was already previously described [12]. Patients were also told to urinate frequently in the following 6-h infusion of the radiopharmaceutical. They were hospitalized for at least 24 h after the administration.

## Imaging

The gamma emission of 177 Luenabled the biodistribution to be monitored during treatment. Anterior and posterior whole-body images were acquired 24 h (±6) after Lu-PRRT with a 256 × 1,024 matrix using a dual-headed gamma camera (In /uniFB01 nia Hawkeye; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA) A Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) study was acquired if necessary.

## Measurement of Effects

To assess safety, laboratory tests, medical interview, physical examination and electrocardiogram were performed at each cycle of treatment. Laboratory tests included: complete blood count with differential and platelet count, hemoglobin, total serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), gamma glutamyl transferase (gamma GT), uric acid, serum creatinine, serum electrolytes (potassium, sodium, calcium, and chloride), international normalized ratio, total protein, and urinalysis. Pregnancy test was also requested in female of childbearing potential.

During follow-up, laboratory tests were performed once a month and physical examination and medical interview were performed every 4 months. Toxicity was evaluated based on any grade of adverse event (AE) from the start of treatment until 30 days after the last treatment cycle, using version 4.0 of the CTCAE [15] and considered for the maximum grade occurred. Acute toxicity refers to any AEs occurring within 30 days of the last treatment administration, while late toxicity refers to AEs occurring more than 30 days after the last treatment.

Management of Toxicities during PRRT

Dose adjustments and delays were managed according to the study protocol. In particular, the decision to modify the administration of the investigational products was based on the nature and severity of the toxicities observed, as de /uniFB01 ned by CTCAE v 4.0 [15]. Detailed information on delays, modi /uniFB01 cations, and toxicity parameters is reported in Figure 4.

## Statistical Considerations

Sample size was calculated using PFS as endpoint, considering a two-tailed alpha error of 0.05, power of 80%, over 36 months and a further 24 months of followup, using an exponential hazard function. Considering a 10% difference in the proportion of patients without progression at 1 year between intensive and standard arm both for patients with RF and patients without RF, a total of 618 were planned to be recruited. In the present report, a preliminary analysis of the /uniFB01 rst 120 GEP and lung NEC patients is shown.

Overall toxicity evaluation was assessed on safety population, de /uniFB01 ned as the group of patients who underwent at least one cycle of therapy. Cycle-by-cycle toxicity was assessed on patients who performed at least two cycles of therapy, to compare punctually the two groups.

Descriptive values for continuous variables were expressed as median (range), while for categorical ones, absolute numbers and percentages were reported. Comparisons among groups were done using chi-square test or Fisher ' s exact test as appropriate. p value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata/SE version 15.1 for Windows (StataCorpLP, College Station, TX, USA).

## Results

## Patients

From May 2016 to July 2018, 120 consecutive GEP and bronchial NENs patients were enrolled and performed at least one cycle of Lu-PRRT. 102 patients had GEP NETs and 1 patient had pancreas NEC. Seventeen patients had lung NETs including 3 TC, 8 AC, and 6 unde /uniFB01 ned carcinoids. Sixty-one patients were randomized in the intensive group (29 in arm A and 32 in arm C) and 59 patients in the standard group (28 in arm B and 31 in arm D).

Among them, 40.0% were symptomatic at baseline and 85.0% had hepatic involvement. Regarding previous treatment, 18.3% had received chemotherapy alone or in

If RF were present, patients were planned to receive 3.7 GBq/cycle, while in absence of RF they were planned to receive 5.5 GBq/cycle. Subsequently, patients were randomly assigned to receive PRRT with an IBC of 5 weeks (intensive) or of 8 -10 weeks (standard).

combination with other therapies (except for PRRT), 9.2% had already received PRRT alone or in combination with other therapies (except for chemotherapy), 15.8% had received chemotherapy and PRRT, 0.8% had received multiple therapies. 70% of the patients had concomitant therapy with SSAs. Other baseline patients ' characteristics are reported in Table 2.

GBq). After that, she continued with SSAs until December 2016, when multiple bilobar liver metastases were detected and the patient underwent a liver transplant. Her hemoglobin at baseline was reduced, but permissive for enrollment according to the protocol inclusion criteria.

## Overall Toxicity

Overall toxicity was evaluated on 120 patients who performed at least one cycle of Lu-PRRT (Table 3). Regarding hematological AEs, no G4 toxicity was detected. Five patients (4.1%) had hematological G3 toxicity, 2 in the intensive group and 3 in the standard one. The most frequent AE was represented by neutropenia (4 patients, 3.3%), while anemia and thrombocytopenia occurred once. We highlighted that 1 patient with GEP NET in the intensive group with RF (arm A) presented both anemia and thrombocytopenia. Speci /uniFB01 cally, the female patient had already been treated with [ 90 Y] Y-DOTA-TOC (Y-PRRT) 4 years before (TCA 11.8

No statistical difference was found comparing the intensive group with the standard one or arm A versus B and arm C versus D. Moreover, hematological AEs were equally distributed into acute (3 events) and late toxicity (3 events).

As regards nephrotoxicity, only 1 patient in the intensive group (arm A) presented a G3 increase in creatinine 6 days after the /uniFB01 rst cycle. The male patient suffered from type II diabetes mellitus and had already been treated with Lu-PRRT approximately 2 years before (TCA 18.5 GBq).

Regarding hepatic toxicity, 1 patient in the intensive group (arm A) developed a G3 ALT elevation after the second cycle. The female patient was affected by pancreatic NET, had voluminous hepatic metastases and had already been widely pretreated (everolimus, temozolomide, and

Fig. 4. We described in detail how toxicities were managed according to the protocol. It is important to underline that as well as considering G3 and G4 toxicities, we also establish more restrictive parametres for creatinine, hemoglobin and neutrophils. First blood tests after PRRT were performed according to the IBC (3 weeks in intensive group and 5 weeks in standard group). If toxicities

occurred, the /uniFB01 rst possibility for the clinicians was to monitor the parameters over time and to delay the treatment. If toxicities still persisted, also the dose reduction was decided, for patients treated with 5.5 GBq/cycle. The treatment was stopped permanently if toxicities persisted despite these measures and beyond 9 weeks after PRRT.

Lu-PRRT associated with metronomic capecitabine). According to the study protocol, her treatment was delayed for 8 weeks, but she did not complete treatment because of clinical progression. No G3 or G4 elevation of AST was detected.

Considering other AEs, only 1 patient in the standard group (arm B) had G3 nausea as an acute effect after the /uniFB01 rst cycle. The male patient was affected by pancreatic

NET, had been extensively pretreated (Y-PRRT, sunitinib, and everolimus) and had occasional nausea before starting re-PRRT. No G3 vomiting was found. 4 patients (3.3%) had G3 asthenia, 3 of them in the intensive group (arm A) and one in the standard group (arm B). Asthenia mainly occurred during the /uniFB01 rst cycles and affected mainly patients with small intestine NET (75% of patients).

## Cycle-by-Cycle Toxicity

One hundred and twelve patients performed at least 2 cycles of Lu-PRRT, 98 with GEP NENs and 14 with lung NETs, 54 in the intensive group and 58 in the standard one.

## Cycle-by-Cycle AEs among These Patients Were Analyzed

slightly higher after the third cycle, when counting 4 AEs equally distributed between the two groups. One patient in the intensive group (arm A) had G3 anemia and thrombocytopenia at the same time after the third cycle. In Table 4, cycle-by-cycle toxicities are reported.

No major renal toxicity was found; indeed the only patient with a G3 increase in creatinine was stopped after the /uniFB01 rst cycle. In this analysis and differently from the overall toxicity analysis above described, G3 asthenia was present only in 1 patient in the standard group, because 2 of the 4 patients already reported recovered after the /uniFB01 rst cycle and 1 patient performed only one cycle.

Regarding G3 hematological toxicity, it was similar between the two groups (intensive and standard) and

## Discussion

The approval of Lu-PRRT for well-differentiated GEP NETs has been revolutionary and is now well established in clinical practice. However, it remains valuable to propose new study protocols and publish results from previous research when possible, especially when they could give additional information on toxicity.

Based on literature and differently from other trials, Lu-PRRT protocols designed by our group historically used less activity/cycle, thus preventing predictable toxicity and the consequent discontinuation of therapy [19]. Wealso used to increase the number of cycles to maintain the same TCA. Fortunately, the increase in the number of cycles did not lead to major scheduling challenges, and patients did not experience signi /uniFB01 cant issues.

When possible, TCA was comparable to that provided in the NETTER-1 study, while for patients with RF we demonstrated that MEA should be considered 18.5 GBq [12]. Regarding gap between cycles, it was left unchanged at until 2016, the year this study was initiated, even in the absence of toxicity. So speci /uniFB01 cally, the novelty of the study was to test an intensive regimen (every 5 weeks) and a standard regimen (every 8 -10 weeks), based on randomization.

Preliminary results of this study on toxicity for patients with GEP and bronchial neoplasms show that no G4 toxicities were observed, and G3 toxicities were very low. Furthermore, the intensive treatment schedule did not result in higher toxicity compared to the standard schedule, even on a cycle-by-cycle basis. The balance between the two groups remained consistent throughout the cycles with dropout rates being similar between the groups.

In particular, major hematological toxicities were low and similar between intensive and standard treatment schedules. This suggests that a 5-week IBC may be as safe as an 8 -10 week IBC for bone marrow preservation, depending on the dose per cycle. The reported hematological toxicities were lower than those typically described in /uniFB01 xed-dose studies. For example, in the NETTER-1 phase 3 trial, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia occurred in 1%, 2%, and 9% of patients, respectively. Other studies have also reported similar or lower rates of severe hematological toxicity [10, 20, 21].

Regarding renal toxicity, we observed only one case of G3 increased creatinine, which occurred in a patient with a history of diabetes and recent severe hypertension. No renal impairment was detected in patients who received at least two cycles. Since the beginning of PRRT, the kidneys were considered a critical organ and nephrotoxicity was extensively investigated, above all in patients treated with Y-PRRT. Recent studies suggest that longterm nephrotoxicity after Lu-PRRT is minimal, with the increased creatinine levels primarily associated with age in patients treated with Y-PRRT [22].

The impact of Lu-PRRT on liver function is less well studied. Mild and severe hepatotoxicity rates after PRRT

are reported to be 12% and 0.4 -2.5%, respectively. Liver function abnormalities are common at baseline due to hepatic metastases [23 -25]. In our study, 85% of patients had liver lesions, but only 1 patient experienced G3 reversible ALT elevation.

In terms of gastrointestinal side effects, 1 patient experienced acute and transient G3 nausea. Although nausea is a common side effect of Lu-PRRT, detailed studies on its incidence and severity are limited. Our /uniFB01 ndings are consistent with other studies reporting varying rates of nausea and asthenia [26, 27].

The low toxicity rate over a 4-month follow-up period is particularly notable given the unfavorable baseline characteristics of the patients, often compromised. Many patients in the study had been extensively pretreated, with 26% having ECOG PS 1, and 40% presenting symptoms of neuroendocrine syndrome. Additionally, 76.3% of patients who underwent FDG PET scans were positive, indicating a more aggressive disease pro /uniFB01 le, as previously demonstrated in our published studies and by other groups [28 -31].

Furthermore, 85% of patients had liver metastases, which is a known negative prognostic factor [32]. It has also been reported that the presence of a liver metastatic burden of more than 50% liver volume could be considered as a predictor of shorter OS [33, 34].

So, the low toxicity rate could be explained with a careful patient selection according to exclusion criteria, ensuring that Lu-PRRT is not performed too soon after other therapies and that any serious toxicities from previous treatments are resolved. We also emphasize also that modulating the dosage according to patients ' characteristics and increasing dose fractionation may help mitigate predictable toxicity. Based on preliminary results obtained in GEP and bronchial NET patients, it does not appear that decreasing the IBC leads to increased toxicity compared to the standard IBC of 8 weeks.

## Study Limitations

This study has several limitations. The results are based on a small patient cohort, and further validation in a larger population with longer follow-up is needed. While the study was designed as a randomized trial, the small sample size and the focus on toxicity data limit our ability to fully evaluate the trial ' s potential. The results might be more promising when combined with ef /uniFB01 cacy data, which will be published when available. Additionally, the protocol was a ' basket ' trial, and data were collected from patients with GEP and lung NENs treated with Lu-PRRT, leading to some heterogeneity in the patient population.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, preliminary results from the randomized phase II trial of patients with GEP and pulmonary NENs treated with Lu-PRRT indicate that the intensive treatment is safe and well tolerated. It appears

possible to develop individualized treatment regimens based on patients ' clinical history and preexisting comorbidities, potentially minimizing toxicity and therapy-related side effects. Further data are needed to con /uniFB01 rm these results.

177 Lu-DOTATATE has emerged as a viable treatment strategy for advanced well-differentiated grade 1/2 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Few retrospective studies have shown concomitant 177 Lu-DOTATATE with radiosensitizing low-dose capecitabine to be effective in advanced NETs. However, this has not been validated in prospective randomized-controlled trials. Methods: In this investigator-initiated, parallel-group, open-label, phase 2 trial, patients with grade 1/2 GEP-NETs, having progressive somatostatin receptor -positive, locally advanced, or metastatic disease on 68 Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 177 Lu-DOTATATE plus capecitabine (experimental arm) or 177 Lu-DOTATATE only (control arm). 177 Lu-DOTATATE was administered at approximately 7.4 GBq/cycle intravenously, for up to 4 cycles, at 8 wk intervals, whereas capecitabine was given at 1,250 mg/m 2 /d orally from day 0 to day 14 of each cycle of 177 Lu-DOTATATE. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate. Secondary endpoints included the disease control rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events. Results: Seventy-two patients (median age, 53 y; range, 18 -79 y) were enrolled. The objective response rate was 33.3% (95% CI, 18.6 -50.9%) in the experimental arm versus 30.6% (95% CI, 16.4 -48.1%) in the control arm ( P 5 0 : 800). The disease control rate was 88.9% (95% CI, 73.9 -96.9%) and 91.7% (95% CI, 77.5 -98.2%) in the experimental and control arms, respectively ( P 5 1.000). The estimated median progression-free survival in the experimental arm was 29 mo (95% CI, 22 -29 mo) versus 31 mo (95% CI, 29 -32 mo) in the control arm ( P 5 0.401). The median overall survival was not reached in either arm ( P 5 0.876). Overall, adverse events of at least grade 3 were noted in 7 patients in the experimental arm versus 6 patients in the control arm ( P 5 0.759). Conclusion: Based on the results of this trial, the addition of low-dose capecitabine to 177 Lu-DOTATATE in advanced grade 1/2 GEP-NETs did not lead to superior radiographic responses. Further studies are needed to evaluate its potential role in high-grade NETs.

G astroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are a rare group of malignancies which have shown an increased burden in recent times ( 1 ). Treatment options for advanced metastatic GEP-NETs include somatostatin analogs, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), targeted drugs, and cytotoxic chemotherapies ( 2 -4 ). Increased somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression in GEPNETs, as demonstrated by high-grade uptake on SSTR-targeted imaging, provides the rationale for the use of PRRT ( 5 ). The PRRT agents bind to the SSTRs on the tumor cell membrane, resulting in the delivery of b - or a -emitting radionuclides, thus causing cellular damage ( 6 ). PRRT with the b -emitting somatostatin analog 177 LuDOTATATE has demonstrated improved survival outcomes in advanced midgut NETs progressing on somatostatin analogs in the pivotal NETTER-1 trial ( 7 , 8 ). Comparative analyses also demonstrate its ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety vis/C18 a-vis everolimus and sunitinib in pancreatic NETs ( 9 , 10 ). Nevertheless, objective radiographic responses with 177 Lu-DOTATATE remain modest, with the NETTER-1 trial reporting only 18% of the midgut NET patients having complete or partial radiographic responses ( 7 ). Thus, there exists an unmet need to further improve the treatment outcomes.

Few observational and single-arm studies have shown combination therapies of PRRT with capecitabine to be effective in advanced NETs ( 11 -14 ). In a single-center retrospective study by Ballal et al., patients treated with concomitant 177 Lu-DOTATATE and low-dose capecitabine showed higher objective response rate (ORR), longer progression-free survival (PFS), and longer overall survival (OS) compared with those treated with 177 Lu-DOTATATE alone ( 13 ). Capecitabine, administered in suboptimal doses in this setting as a radiosensitizer, acts through inducing inappropriate progression through the S-phase cell cycle checkpoint into the radiosensitive G2/M phase and inhibiting DNA damage repair, thereby suggesting it has a synergistic role with PRRT ( 15 , 16 ). A few other

studies have also demonstrated the safety of this combination approach ( 17 , 18 ). However, to the best of our knowledge, no prospective randomized controlled study has yet been conducted to establish the added bene /uniFB01 t associated with this combination approach over standalone PRRT. In this phase 2 trial, we intended to compare the activity of concomitant 177 Lu-DOTATATE plus capecitabine and 177 Lu-DOTATATE alone in patients with advanced welldifferentiated GEP-NETs.

This was an investigator-initiated randomized, parallel-group, openlabel, phase 2 trial, prospectively registered at the Clinical Trials Registry-India (CTRI/2020/01/022636). Between January 2020 and May 2023, patients with advanced well-differentiated grade 1/2 GEPNETs were enrolled at a tertiary care referral center. The trial protocol is available as supplemental material (supplemental materials are available at http://jnm.snmjournals.org) ( 19 -28 ). Patients were considered eligible if they had progressive, locally advanced, or metastatic disease on a recent 68 Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT scan (within 12 wk), with signi /uniFB01 cant SSTR expression, de /uniFB01 ned as the avidity of lesions being greater than that of a normal liver. The patients were required to have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of no more than 2 and adequate hematologic, renal, and liver function reserve. All patients also underwent an 18 F-FDG PET/CT at baseline (within 2 wk of the 68 Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT), and those with discordant lesions (SSTR negative but 18 F-FDG positive) were excluded (detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in the trial protocol in Supplemental Table 1). Informed written consent was obtained from the patients before inclusion. The study was approved by the Institute Ethics Committee (INT/IEC/2019/002803) and was conducted according to guidelines in the Helsinki Declaration.

## Randomization and Masking

Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the experimental arm, 177 Lu-DOTATATE plus capecitabine, or the control arm, 177 Lu-DOTATATE alone. Random allocation was accomplished using a computer-generated block randomization sequence (block size of 2). Allocation concealment was done using sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes. However, the interventions were not masked to either the patients or the trial staff.

## Intervention Procedures

The patients in both arms were administered up to 4 cycles of 177 Lu-DOTATATE (approximately 7.4 GBq/cycle) intravenously over 30 min at 8 wk intervals. Pretreatment with 8 mg of intravenous ondansetron and 8 mg of dexamethasone was performed. To ensure nephroprotection, an intravenous amino acid infusion comprising 26.8 g of lysine and 9.6 g of arginine in 2 L of solution was given over 4 h, starting 30 min before the infusion of 177 Lu-DOTATATE as per established department protocol ( 29 , 30 ). Patients were monitored for 24 h for any immediate adverse event (AE), and a posttherapy scan was acquired at 24 -48 h. Additionally, in the experimental arm, oral capecitabine was given as a radiosensitizer at a dose of 1,250 mg/m 2 /d from days 0 to 14 of each cycle of 177 Lu-DOTATATE. This dose and schedule of radiosensitizing capecitabine was adapted from the studies by Claringbold et al. and Ballal et al. and was based on our own previous clinical experience ( 11 , 13 , 29 , 30 ). In both treatment arms, patients were allowed to receive long-acting or short-acting octreotide if they experienced functional symptoms (e.g., diarrhea or /uniFB02 ushing). Patients who showed radiographic progression on follow-up or experienced persistent grade 3 or greater toxicities (in the case of thrombocytopenia, grade $ 2, and for nephrotoxicity, grade $ 2, with estimated glomerular /uniFB01 ltration rate of , 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) were discontinued from the study and were treated with other options as per established guidelines.

## Treatment Endpoints

Patients were followed every 3 wk with complete hemogram, liver, and renal function tests. Radiographic response was assessed by 2 masked reviewers using contrast-enhanced CT images of the wholebody 68 Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT at around 8 wk after every 2 cycles of 177 Lu-DOTATATE and every 24 wk thereafter until disease progression. The primary endpoint was the ORR, which was calculated as the proportion of patients achieving complete response and partial response per RECIST 1.1 ( 31 ). Secondary endpoints included disease control rate, PFS, OS, and toxicity pro /uniFB01 le. Disease control rate was de /uniFB01 ned as the proportions of complete response, partial response, and stable disease per RECIST 1.1 ( 31 ). PFS was estimated from the start of the treatment until radiographic progression or death due to any cause. OS was estimated from the start of the treatment until the occurrence of death due to any cause. Treatment-related toxicity was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0.

## Statistical Analysis

The sample size of 72 patients was calculated to detect a 30% absolute improvement in ORR with concomitant 177 Lu-DOTATATE plus capecitabine while assuming an ORR of 20% with 177 Lu-DOTATATE alone, a power of 80% at 2-sided a -level of 5%, and an allocation ratio of 1:1. The assumed response rate with 177 Lu-DOTATATE alone was based on prior literature, whereas the assumption of 30% absolute improvement with the addition of capecitabine was based on the study by Ballal et al. ( 7 , 13 ). The primary analysis was by intention to treat and included all the randomized patients. Per-protocol analysis for the primary endpoint was also done comprising patients who completed all 4 cycles of the allocated treatment. The categoric variables were expressed as numbers and percentages. For interarm comparison, a x 2 test or a Fisher-exact test was used for testing signi /uniFB01 cance of any difference. Risk ratios and their 95% CIs were also used for overall and subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint. The continuous variables were expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR). A Mann -Whitney U test was used for testing the signi /uniFB01 cance of difference

between the arms. A prespeci /uniFB01 ed interim survival analysis was done using the Kaplan -Meier curve method and the Cox proportional hazards regression model. A log-rank test was used to compare the median PFS and OS durations between the treatment arms. The median follow-up duration was calculated using the reverse Kaplan -Meier estimator.

Statistical analyses were done using IBM ' s SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 20.0, and R Statistical Software (The R Project for Statistical Computing). The Kaplan -Meier curves were plotted using MedCalc for Windows, version 22.026. A 2-tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically signi /uniFB01 cant.

## RESULTS

## Clinical Characteristics

Of the 91 patients assessed for eligibility, 72 patients with advanced grade 1/2 GEP-NETs were included, comprising 36 patients in each arm (Fig. 1). The patients ' characteristics were observed to be similar in both the arms (Table 1). The median age of the patients was 53 y (IQR, 41 -61 y). Gastrointestinal NETs accounted for most of the primary tumors (45/72, 62.5%) with small bowel being the most frequent primary site (32/72, 44.4%). Most of the patients had lower-grade tumors, with a Ki-67 index less than 10% in 53 of 72 patients (73.6%). The most common sites of metastases included lymph nodes (47/72, 65.3%) and liver (58/72, 80.6%). Overall, 45 of the 72 patients (62.5%) had Krenning score of 4 on the 68 Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT, with the rest having a Krenning score of 3.

## Treatment Characteristics

Sixty of the 72 patients (83.3%) completed all 4 cycles of 177 Lu-DOTATATE, receiving a cumulative activity of 29.6 GBq. These included 32 patients in the experimental arm and 28 patients in the control arm. The reasons for not completing 4 cycles of 177 Lu-DOTATATE in the remaining 12 patients were progressive disease (radiographic progression, n 5 2; clinical progression, n 5 1), disease-related deaths ( n 5 2), coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic

( n 5 2 ), loss of SSTR expression ( n 5 1), and treatmentemergent AEs ( n 5 4). No event of capecitabine discontinuation during the cycles of 177 Lu-DOTATATE was observed in the experimental arm.

## Radiographic Response

Two patients, 1 in each arm, died before their /uniFB01 rst radiographic follow-up. Of the 36 patients, 12 in the experimental arm (Fig. 2A) and 11 in the control arm (Fig. 2B) achieved partial response. No event of complete response was observed in either arm. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the ORR was 33.3% (95% CI, 18.6 -50.9%) in the experimental arm and 30.6% (95% CI, 16.4 -48.1%) in the control arm (risk ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.56 -2.14; P 5 0.800). In the per-protocol analysis, the ORR was 11 of 32 (34.4%; 95% CI, 18.6 -53.2%) and 10 of 28 (35.7%; 95% CI, 18.6 -55.9%) in the experimental and control arms, respectively (risk ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.48 -1.92; P 5 0.914). Overall, the disease control rate was 32 of 36 (88.9%; 95% CI, 73.9 -96.9%) in the experimental arm compared with 33 of 36 (91.7%; 95% CI, 77.5 -98.2%) in the control arm ( P 5 1.000). The median percentage changes in the sums of largest dimensions of the target lesions in the evaluable patients were 2 12.0% (IQR, 2 36.6 to 2 2.8%) and 2 8.6% (IQR, 2 36.6 to 2 2.1%) in the experimental and control arms, respectively ( P 5 0.842). No signi /uniFB01 cant difference in the risk ratios for ORR was observed between the 2 arms across the different subgroups (Fig. 3).

## Survival Analysis and Follow-up

At the /uniFB01 rst data cutoff date of May 23, 2024 (median follow-up, 27.5 mo; 95% CI, 23.9 -30.5 mo), a total of 25 events of disease progression or death had occurred in the study cohort: 14 events in the experimental arm and 11 events in the control arm. The estimated median PFS duration in the experimental arm was 29 mo

(95% CI, 22 -29 mo) compared with 31 mo (95% CI, 29 -32 mo) in the control arm (unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.63 -3.06) (Fig. 4A). The estimated PFS rates at 12 and 24 mo were 86.1% (95% CI, 74.6 -97.6%) and 62.5% (95% CI, 43.8 -81.2%), respectively, in the experimental arm versus 86.1% (95% CI, 74.6 -97.6%) and 72.7% (95% CI, 55.5 -89.9), respectively, in the control arm ( P 5 0.401). The median OS was not reached in either arm (unadjusted hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.30 -4.13; P 5 0.876) (Fig. 4B).

## Toxicity

Overall, AEs of any grade were observed in 29 patients (80.6%; 95% CI, 63.9 -91.8%) in the experimental arm and 31 patients (86.1%; 95% CI, 70.5 -95.3%) in the control arm ( P 5 0.527). AEs of at least grade 3 were noted in 7 patients (19.4%; 95% CI, 8.2 -36.0%) in the experimental arm compared with 6 patients (16.7%; 95% CI, 6.4 -32.8%) in the control arm ( P 5 0.759). The most commonly encountered symptomatic AEs in either arm was nausea or vomiting, which was mainly attributable to the amino acid infusion and promptly relieved after its completion. Most of these toxicities were grade 1/2 events. Among the laboratory parameters, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia of at least grade 3 were recorded in 3 (8.3%), 3 (8.3%), 1 (2.8%), and 1 patients (2.8%), respectively, in the experimental arm. The corresponding /uniFB01 gures for the control arm were 2 (5.6%), 1 (2.8%), 0 (0%), and 3 (8.3%), respectively. There was no reported case of nephrotoxicity of grade 3 or greater in either arm. Long-term AEs such as myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia were not observed in this cohort until the time of follow-up. The toxicity pro /uniFB01 les of both the treatment arms are summarized in Table 2.

## DISCUSSION

177 Lu-DOTATATE has shown remarkable clinical and survival bene /uniFB01 ts in advanced progressive GEP-NETs. Nevertheless, radiographic response rates remain modest ( 7 , 8 ). We hypothesized that the addition of low-dose capecitabine as a radiosensitizer to 177 Lu-DOTATATE could potentially lead to superior radiographic responses. Few observational and single-arm studies reported that the addition of oral capecitabine as a radiosensitizer to 177 Lu-DOTATATE therapy in patients with inoperable and metastatic, progressive, well-differentiated NETs was safe and achieved high tumor control ( 11 -14 , 17 , 18 ). In a retrospective comparative analysis, Ballal et al. reported the combination of 177 Lu-DOTATATE and low-dose capecitabine to be safe with signi /uniFB01 cantly higher rates of objective response ( /C24 27% absolute difference) compared with 177 Lu-DOTATATE therapy alone ( 13 ). However, the results of these observational studies are limited by their single-arm or retrospective study designs and are not supported by those of our current phase 2 randomized controlled trial.

In the current study, we randomized patients with advanced grade 1/2 GEP-NETs to 177 Lu-DOTATATE plus low-dose capecitabine or 177 Lu-DOTATATE alone. The ORR was 33% in our combination arm versus 31% with 177 Lu-DOTATATE monotherapy, with the difference being neither clinically nor statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. Per-protocol analysis as well as subgroup analyses across the different strata also did not show any signi /uniFB01 cant difference in the ORRs between the 2 arms. Further, the median PFS was also similar between the 2 arms. Our results, therefore, suggest that the addition of low-dose capecitabine to 177 Lu-DOTATATE in advanced grade 1/2 GEP-NETs may not be clinically relevant in the absence of any signi /uniFB01 cant additive or synergistic effect. Since capecitabine acts on the S-phase of the cell cycle, the low proliferation index in grade 1/2 NETs could thus be the reason behind its apparent lack of bene /uniFB01 t in such cases ( 15 , 16 ).

Our results regarding the similar ef /uniFB01 cacy of 177 Lu-DOTATATE with or without capecitabine in advanced grade 1/2 GEP-NETs are supported by the initial /uniFB01 ndings from the Australasian CONTROLNET trial. Here, patients with grade 1/2 midgut NETs were randomized to either 177 Lu-DOTATATE plus capecitabine and temozolomide ( n 5 33) or 177 Lu-DOTATATE alone ( n 5 14). The ORR was 34.4% in the combination arm versus 23.1% in the monotherapy arm ( P . 0.5). The PFS rates at 36 mo were also similar between the 2 arms (60.4% vs. 61.5%, respectively) ( 32 ).

One interesting observation in the current trial was the ORR of 31% in the 177 Lu-DOTATATE monotherapy arm. This was considerably higher than the 18% ORR reported in the landmark NETTER-1 trial ( 7 ). Two essential differences between the 2 trials need to be highlighted. Although the NETTER-1 trial included only midgut NETs, the current trial included all GEP-NETs. More importantly, only patients with a Krenning score of 3/4 were included in this trial, whereas the NETTER-1 trial also included those with a Krenning score of 2. These differences in patient selection could explain the relatively higher ORR with 177 LuDOTATATE alone in our study.

Despite the lack of additive or synergistic action in grade 1/2 GEP-NETs, concomitant capecitabine was well-tolerated in our patients. AEs of at least grade 3 were observed in a similar propor-

tion of patients with or without capecitabine. This high safety margin has important rami /uniFB01 cations for treatment strategies in high-grade NETs (Ki-67 index, . 20%), wherein combination chemotherapy and PRRT can potentially lead to better outcomes. In a retrospective study evaluating the combination therapy of 177 Lu-DOTATATE with capecitabine plus temozolomide in SSTR-expressing, grade 2/3 NETs after progression with PRRT or chemotherapy alone, Yordanova et al. reported a clinical bene /uniFB01 t rate of 55% and a median OS of nearly 25 mo ( 33 ).

Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, the current study remains one of the /uniFB01 rst and largest controlled trials evaluating the role of combined PRRT and chemotherapy in advanced grade 1/2 GEP-NETs and /uniFB01 lls an important gap in the literature. The randomized, parallel-group design, masked radiographic assessments, and adequate uniform follow-up are its major strengths.

## CONCLUSION

The LuCAP trial provides the /uniFB01 rst randomized phase 2 data showing that the addition of capecitabine to 177 Lu-DOTATATE in advanced grade 1/2 GEP-NETs does not result in clinically or statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in radiographic responses and, hence, may not be routinely warranted. Future research exploring the potential synergy between PRRT and capecitabine-based chemotherapy may be directed toward higher-grade GEP-NETs or those with SSTR- and 18 F-FDG -discordant lesions.

## KEY POINTS

QUESTION: Does the addition of capecitabine to 177 Lu-DOTATATE improve radiographic responses in patients with advanced grade 1/2 GEP-NETs?

PERTINENT FINDINGS: In this randomized phase 2 trial, 72 patients with progressive, advanced grade 1/2 SSTR-positive GEP-NETs were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with 177 Lu-DOTATATE plus capecitabine or 177 Lu-DOTATATE alone. The ORR rate was 33.3% in the combination arm versus 30.6% in the monotherapy arm, a nonsigni /uniFB01 cant difference.

IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: The addition of capecitabine to 177 Lu-DOTATATE in advanced grade 1/2 GEP-NETs did not lead to superior radiographic responses and, hence, may not be routinely warranted.

## Abstract

Purpose Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE has been shown to effectively prolong progression free survival in grade 1-2 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET), but is less efficacious in patients with extensive liver metastases. The aim was to investigate whether tumour uptake in liver metastases can be enhanced by intra-arterial administration of   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE into the hepatic artery, in order to improve tumour response without increasing toxicity.

Methods Twenty-seven patients with grade 1-2 GEP-NET, and bi-lobar liver metastases were randomized to receive intraarterial PRRT in the left or right liver lobe for four consecutive cycles. The contralateral liver lobe and extrahepatic disease were treated via a 'second-pass' effect and the contralateral lobe was used as the control lobe. Up to three metastases (&gt; 3 cm) per liver lobe were identified as target lesions at baseline on contrast-enhanced CT. The primary endpoint was the tumour-tonon-tumour (T/N) uptake ratio on the 24 h post-treatment   [ 177 Lu]Lu-SPECT/CT after the first cycle. This was calculated for each target lesion in both lobes using the mean uptake. T/N ratios in both lobes were compared using paired-samples t -test. Findings After the first cycle, a non-significant difference in T/N uptake ratio was observed: T/N IA =  17·4 vs. T/N control =  16·2 ( p =  0·299). The mean increase in T/N was 17% (1·17; 95% CI [1·00; 1·37]). Of all patients, 67% (18/27) showed any increase in T/N ratio after the first cycle.

Conclusion Intra-arterial   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE is safe, but does not lead to a clinically significant increase in tumour uptake.

## Research in context

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) using   [ 177 Lu] Lu-DOTATATE prolongs progression-free  survival  in patients with grade 1 and 2 midgut neuro-endocrine tumours. However, both the NETTER-1 trial and several cohort studies showed lower progression free survival in patients with bulky or extensive neuroendocrine tumour liver metastases (NELM). A few small retrospective and non-randomized studies investigated the effect of intra-arterial PRRT which is deemed to enhance tumour uptake in hepatic metastases, showing promising results. However, the true added effect of intra-arterial PRRT on efficacy and toxicity remains unclear to date.

## Added value of this study

The heterogeneity of neuroendocrine neoplasms required a randomized controlled trial to assess the true effects of intraarterial   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE. As inter-patient comparison would be compromised by tumour heterogeneity, thus an in-patient randomized controlled trial design was chosen to reduce this important bias. A significant increase in tumour uptake after intra-arterial administration is thought to result in improved tumour response and ultimately survival, thereby outweighing the increased patient burden and risks of multiple hepatic artery catheterizations.

## Implications of all the available evidence

Intra-arterial   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE administration was safe, but did not result in a clinically significant increase in tumour uptake. Besides, no differences in response after three and six months were observed. Therefore, the results do not justify the intra-arterial administration of PRRT in patients with NELM.

## Background

Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) constitute a heterogeneous group of tumours. They range from well-differentiated slowly proliferative tumours to moderately differentiated rapidly growing tumours. Some tumours secrete active substances (i.e. functioning tumours), while others do not (i.e. non-functioning). Their specific characteristics together with their wide variety in localizations complicate treatment. Moreover, in 32-63% of all patients with NET, metastases are already present at the time of diagnosis [1, 2]. Irrespective of the stage of the disease, the reported overall five-year survival rates are over 60%. However,

when neuroendocrine liver metastases (NELM) are present, the median overall survival decreases to 2-4 years for GEP-NET [3, 4]. Unfortunately, the vast majority of metastases are located in the liver and besides the impaired survival, patients with NELM also have a lower quality of life [5].

Intravenous administered somatostatin receptor-targeting radiopharmaceuticals, i.e. peptide-receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT), improves progression free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced midgut NET, progressive on somatostatin analogues [6]. The radiopharmaceutical binds to the somatostatin receptor, overexpressed on the cell surface of the tumour cells, followed by internalization of the radionuclide-peptide-receptor complex. The emitted radiation damages the DNA, which subsequently leads to the induction of cell death [7]. The NETTER-1 trial randomly assigned 229 patients to receive intravenous   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE plus octreotide LAR (long acting release, 30 mg every four weeks) versus octreotide LAR alone (60 mg every four weeks) [6]. PFS rate at 20 months was 65·2% versus 10·8% in favour of   [ 177 Lu]LuDOTATATE. As much as 84% of patients in NETTER-1 had NELM. While the extent of NELM did not relate to PFS, more bulky disease (i.e. target lesion &gt; 3 cm) however did relate to a significantly decreased PFS [8]. In general, patients with (bulky) NELM have significantly shorter time to progression and suffer from increased morbidity and mortality. In the largest published cohort, including over 500 patients, it was shown that patients with extensive liver metastases have a worse outcome in terms of overall survival after treatment with   [ 177 Lu]LuDOTATATE [9].

To improve treatment of liver metastases multiple studies indicated that intra-arterial administration of radiolabelled somatostatin receptor analogues into the hepatic artery may increase the uptake in NELM [10]. Repeated   [ 68 Ga] Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT (interval 4 weeks) in 15 NELM patients showed a standardized uptake value (SUV) increase in 117/122 (96%) liver metastases, which was 1·44-7·eightfold higher after intra-arterial administration compared to intravenous administration [11]. This finding was confirmed in a preclinical animal study and a subsequent pilot study in three patients with NELM using 111 In-DTPA-octreotide with an increased tumour uptake up to 2·ninefold after intraarterial administration [12, 13].

The aim of our study was to treat patients with bulky NELM, with an indication  for    [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE PRRT, by an intra-arterial approach via a microcatheter in the hepatic artery, instead of intravenously. Using an innovative prospective study design with in-patient randomization to guarantee effective comparison with minimal risk of bias due to heterogeneity, the additional benefit of intra-arterial over intravenous administration was investigated.

## Methods

## Study design and participants

The Lutetium Intra-Arterial (LUTIA) study is a multicentre, open-label, phase II, within-patient randomized controlled trial (RCT). The study protocol was previously published and was approved by the medical ethics committees (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03590119) [14]. The study sought to investigate whether uptake of   [ 177 Lu] Lu-DOTATATE in liver metastases could be enhanced by intra-arterial administration as opposed to conventional intravenous  administration.  The  study  used  a  withinpatient comparison design, in order to increase statistical power and reduce the influence of inter-patient differences on the primary outcome of the study, especially to avoid bias by tumour heterogeneity. Patients were treated intraarterially, receiving   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE (Lutathera®, Novartis) in either the left or the right hepatic artery for all four treatment cycles using 7·4 GBq per cycle. The control lobe and extrahepatic lesions received   [ 177 Lu]LuDOTATATE via a second-pass effect (Fig. 1). As primary endpoint, 177 Lu uptake in the intra-arterially treated liver metastases was compared to control metastases in the contralateral liver lobe after the first cycle. As secondary endpoints, tumour uptake of 177 Lu after all cycles, difference in tumour response, and toxicity were assessed. The study was performed at the University Medical Centre Utrecht (Utrecht, The Netherlands), the Erasmus Medical Centre (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) and the Netherlands Cancer Institute (Amsterdam, The Netherlands).

patients had an indication for   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE treatment as determined by the multidisciplinary tumour board, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive tumours on   [ 68 Ga] Ga-SSTR PET imaging, and sufficient organ function (bone marrow, liver and kidney) [15]. In addition, included patients needed to have at least one metastasis of at least 3 cm in each liver lobe. Only patients with grade 1 or grade 2 gastroenteropancreatic (GEP-)NET were included. The extent of extrahepatic metastatic disease was not an exclusion criterion. Patients with previous liver targeted therapies within one year prior to screening and patients who had undergone previous cycles with radionuclide therapy were excluded from participation.

At baseline, patient characteristics, complaints, disease characteristics, and current and previous treatment schedules were recorded. Laboratory blood tests were taken for determination of baseline hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Finally, multiphase contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the abdomen and   [ 68 Ga]Ga-SSTR PET/CT were performed. PET/CT imaging was performed according to local acquisition protocols.

## Procedures

Patients with NELM were included according to the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society (ENETS) guidelines:

Prior to the first treatment, patients were randomized to receive treatment in the left or right hepatic artery. On the day of treatment, patients were admitted and had laboratory testing prior to their transfer to the angiography suite. Patients received an amino acids solution consisting of 2.5% Lysine/2.5% Arginine in 1L saline infused over 4 h, starting 30 min before start of   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE infusion. Via transradial or transfemoral access, a microcatheter was placed in the designated hepatic artery. Subsequently, a cone beam CT was performed to accurately define the perfusion

volume of the intra-arterially treated artery. Finally,   [ 177 Lu] Lu-DOTATATE was administered by flushing the   [ 177 Lu]LuDOTATATE vial with 200 mL saline during 30 min (Utrecht and Amsterdam sites) or by syringe pump injection during 30 min, followed by flushing during 15 min (Rotterdam site), after which the access site was closed by either an air-filled wrist band or femoral closure device. Patients remained admitted for one night, according to Dutch radiation safety guidelines.

Twenty-one to 27 h post-injection, 177 Lu total body planar scintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging of the liver were acquired for primary endpoint assessment (Fig. 2). Images were acquired with a Medium Energy Low Penetration (MELP) collimator. Acquisition settings were harmonized across all systems: body contour trajectory, a photon energy window of 208 keV (± 10%) and 113 keV (± 10%), adjacent 20% lower scatter windows, 2 × 64 projections, a 128 × 128 matrix size, and a reference projection time of 20 s. Four weeks after each   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE cycle, adverse events, laboratory testing and eligibility for the next treatment cycle was checked at the out-patient clinic. Laboratory testing, CECT of the abdomen, and   [ 68 Ga]GaDOTATOC PET/CT were repeated at 3 and 6 months after the fourth   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE cycle.

## Image analysis

Both tumour uptake and response were analysed using predefined target lesions. On baseline CECT, up to three target lesions were selected within each liver lobe, measuring at least 3 cm in diameter on axial plane CECT. A Volume of Interest (VOI) accounting for at least 15 mL was drawn in the healthy liver tissue in the control lobe (without metastasis on CECT and without pathological uptake on   [ 68 Ga]GaSSTR PET) to determine the normal uptake. VOI's of predefined target lesions were segmented semi-automatically on baseline   [ 68 Ga]Ga-SSTR PET/CT images, by drawing a rough VOI around the target lesions, and shrinking the VOI using a threshold of 42% of the maximum voxel SUV in the initial VOI [16]. Baseline   [ 68 Ga]Ga-SSTR PET/CT images were co-registered to all 177 Lu SPECT/CT images (rigid registration), and VOIs were transferred to extract the mean and peak uptake values in target lesion VOIs and in the normal-tissue VOI. Uptake was calculated as counts per voxel on SPECT/CT. Peak uptake was defined as the mean counts per voxel in a sphere-shaped VOI with a diameter of 1 cm around the voxel with the highest voxel value [17].

## Endpoints

The  primary  endpoint  was  the  tumour-to-non-tumour (T/N) ratio of uptake values in target lesions between the

intra-arterial (T/N IA ) and control (T/N control ) liver lobe on [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE SPECT/CT after the first cycle. T/N was defined as the weighted average of activity uptake in the predefined VOIs, divided by the uptake in the normal tissue VOI in the control lobe.

As a secondary endpoint, T/N ratios were calculated using the peak uptake in the predefined VOIs (supplemental material). Additionally, T/N ratios of all cycles were evaluated (i.e. 18-24 h post-treatment 177 Lu-SPECT/CT after every cycle). Objective response of pre-defined target lesions was determined on CECT at baseline, and at 3- and 6-months post-treatment, according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1 [18]. Target lesions could be a composite of multiple confluent tumours.

Safety analysis consisted of laboratory testing (hepatic, renal and haematological parameters) and recording of clinical adverse events (AEs) during all visits. Laboratory values were categorized using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, and baseline laboratory tests were recorded. Toxicity due to PRRT was only considered if the CTCAE grade was higher than the baseline toxicity grade. Technical success rate was defined as the fraction of treatments allowing intra-arterial administration of   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE.

As a post hoc analysis, factors influencing tumour uptake were tested against T/N results.

## Randomization and blinding

Patients were randomized 1:1 between intra-arterial   [ 177 Lu] Lu-DOTATATE via the left or the right hepatic artery using a computer-generated permuted block sequence with block sizes of n =  1 and n =  2. No stratification was used due to the small study sample. Patients and medical personnel were not blinded for the randomization result. Blinded image analysis for primary and secondary endpoints was performed (i.e. without knowledge of intra-arterial treatment lobe).

## Statistical analysis

The minimum number of patients needed to test for a moderate to large effect (i.e. a Cohen's d z of 0·65) was calculated. A power of 0·9 was achieved in case of a minimum sample size of 26 patients. All patients who received at least one cycle intra-arterially were included in statistical analysis. For the primary outcome a paired samples t -test was used, comparing the T/N IA against T/N control , which is equivalent to a one-sample t -test on the within-patient differences in T/N. As secondary outcome, the proportional difference in T/N was tested by performing a paired samples t -test on the log-transformed data. Estimates (mean and 95% confidence interval (CI)) were then transformed back by taking the exponent of the log-transformed estimates. Differences

The resulting  T/N IA ratio  was  9.4,  and  the  T/N control ratio  was  6.9.  Both liver  lobes  showed  stable  disease  at  3  and  6  months  post-treatment follow-up imaging

in T/N, when considering all cycles, were tested using linear mixed-effects models by incorporating a random intercept on two levels, i.e. per patient (to adjust for the correlation of data within a patient) and per cycle (to incorporate the paired-samples design of the study). Factors influencing T/N were tested by adding them to a linear-effects model

## Results

In total, 30 patients were included between August 2018 and January 2022, of whom 27 patients were treated according to the study protocol. All 27 patients were included in the primary endpoint analysis. One patient was excluded and switched over to intravenous PRRT due to delivery issues of    [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE on the day of the scheduled intra-arterial therapy, and two patients received intravenous PRRT due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Fourteen patients (52%) received intra-arterial   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE in the right hepatic artery and 13 patients (48%) in the left hepatic artery (Fig. 3). There were no crossover events. Technical success rate was 100%. Two patients only completed one cycle, of which one voluntarily withdrew from the study,

and one patient died due to disease progression. One patient was referred for additional treatment after receiving two cycles due to disease progression. Baseline characteristics are reported in Table 1.

## Primary endpoint

There was no significant difference between the mean uptake-based T/N IA and  T/N control ratios  on  SPECT/CT after the first cycle, with a mean T/N IA of 17·9 (95% CI [10·6, 25·1]) and a mean T/N control of 16·2 (95% CI [8·2, 24·2], p =  0·299). The mean difference between T/N IA and T/Ncontrol was 1·65 (95% CI [-1·55, 4·85]; Fig. 4). A total of 18/27 patients (67%) had a higher T/N IA , than T/N control . Five patients (19%) had an increase in T/N IA of more than 50%, and two patients (7%) had a T/N IA increase of more than 100%.

## Secondary endpoints

After the first cycle, the relative difference between T/ NIA and T/N control was 0·17, i.e. the T/N IA was 17% higher on average than the T/N control , ( p =  0·045, 95% CI [0·00,

0·31]). One-hundred post-treatment 177 Lu SPECT/CT scans acquired in 27 patients were available for analysis of secondary endpoints. There was no significant difference between the T/N IA and T/N control when all cycles are combined, with a mean T/NIA  of 13·5 (95% CI [11·0, 16·0]) and a mean T/ Ncontrol of 12·4 (95% CI [9·7, 15·2], p =  0·216). The absolute mean difference was 1·03 (95% CI [-0·61, 2·68]). The T/N IA was 12·7% higher compared to T/N control , when considering the multiplicative difference ( p =  0·031, 95% CI [0·01, 0·26]). In addition to the mean uptake in each VOI, the peak uptake was used in secondary analysis. After the first cycle, and after all cycles, the absolute increase in peak uptake was not statistically significant ( p =  0·091 and p =  0·637, respectively). However, a small significant relative increase was found both after the first cycle and after all cycles ( p =  0·010 and p =  0·045, respectively; Supplemental 1). The following possible factors of influence tested insignificant: whether tumours were visually hypervascular ( p =  0·217); the liver lobe  that  was  selected  for  intra-arterial  administration ( p =  0·713); the hepatic tumour burden ( p =  0·053).

Response was assessed in 24 patients 3 months after treatment and in 23 patients 6 months after treatment in whom post-treatment CECT was available. One patient was referred for additional treatment before imaging was performed after

One patient died due to disease progression after receiving the first cycle. One patient was referred for additional treatment before finishing four cycles of intra-arterial PRRT, and another patient was referred after the 3-month follow-up imaging. One patient voluntarily withdrew from the study after the first cycle. Twenty-four patients finished all four treatment cycles

6 months follow-up. At 3 months after the final cycle, partial tumour response was seen in 6/24 (25%), while stable disease was observed in the remaining 18/24 (75%) cases in both intra-arterially treated liver lobes and control lobes ( p =  1·0) (Fig. 5). At 6 months post-treatment, there were 8/23 (35%) cases with partial response, 14/23 (61%) with stable disease, and 1/23 (4%) with progressive disease. Again, no difference in tumour reduction was found ( p =  1·0) (Table 2).

Toxicity was acceptable and as expected (Table 3). In the 26·4 patient-years of follow-up, two patients experienced CTCAE grade 3 or 4 hepatic toxicities: one patient with baseline gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GT) elevation grade 3 and baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevation grade 2, temporarily developed grade 4 γ-GT elevation and grade 3 ALP elevation, followed by an almost complete normalization of γ-GT and ALP after observing partial tumour response. Another patient with baseline γ-GT elevation grade 2 developed grade 3 toxicity due to intrahepatic disease progression. Overall, average liver enzyme trend lines showed no change greater than 15%, with a slight decrease in liver enzyme levels during follow-up (Fig. 6). Concerning haematological toxicity, grade 3 lymphocytopenia was observed in 7 (26%) of patients, and grade 4 lymphocytopenia was observed in 1 (4%) patient. No other grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity was observed and no renal toxicity was encountered.

During follow-up, multiple clinical AEs were encountered (Table 4). The most common AEs were grade 1 and grade 2 fatigue (37% and 33%) and grade 1 and grade 2 nausea (37%

Clinical  adverse  events  graded  according  to  CTCAE  5.0  occurring during follow-up after intra-arterial [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE. *Occurred twice in the same patient and 11%). In most patients, fatigue occurred in the weeks following PRRT, while nausea occurred shortly after administration despite pre-treatment with anti-emetics. Nine patients (33%) complained of pain, swelling or hematoma at the femoral or radial puncture site. However, no complications requiring intervention were observed. Two patients had light back pain following the angiographic procedure, while one patient complained of severe back pain. One patient suffered a moderate allergic reaction to iodine contrast agent at the third angiography procedure, and one patient suffered a severe allergic reaction to iodine contrast agent during the acquisition of a follow-up CECT. Unrelated to the angiography, one patient was hospitalized for a carcinoid crisis twice, 11 days and 10 days after the first and the fourth treatment cycle, respectively.

## Discussion

A non-significant increase in tumour uptake of   [ 177 Lu]LuDOTATATE of 17% was found after intra-arterial administration compared to systemic administration. Furthermore, no difference was found in objective response rates between intra-arterial and intravenous treated liver metastases during the first 6 months after treatment. Besides angiographic procedure related side effects, no additional toxicity was found, but the lack of clinical benefit does not seem to justify an intra-arterial treatment approach in this setting.

Using a within-patient randomization design, many inbetween patient biases were avoided. A moderately-large effect size was deliberately chosen, because sufficient patient benefit should be gained to compensate for the additional risks (e.g. bleeding, artery dissection) and burden of multiple angiography procedures. Due to the high statistical power, it is unlikely that a clinically significant increase in tumour uptake will be found by increasing the study sample. This is supported by the secondary endpoint analysis, in which a small but statistically significant increase in T/N IA of only 12.7% was found. This minor non-significant increase in T/ NIA did not result in an increased tumour response within 6 months after the fourth treatment.

Other groups have previously studied the effects of intraarterial PRRT, using different radiopharmaceuticals, all based on the same hypothesis: an increase in tumour uptake in NELM might be achieved by intra-arterial administration, as exposure to high concentration of a radiopharmaceutical during a short period of time may induce complete saturation of   SST 2 receptors. In a previously published review, multiple retrospective studies showed predominantly favourable outcomes after intra-arterial administration. Three studies by Kratochwil et al. are the most noteworthy [10]. In one study, 15 patients were injected with   [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC intravenously and intra-arterially (i.e. into the main hepatic artery), with 4 weeks in-between, reporting a 3.75-fold increase in SUV-measurements after intra-arterial administration [11]. However, injection-to-imaging delay, affinity, dosing, and specific activity differ significantly between [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC and   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE, so that an increase in uptake using other radiopharmaceuticals cannot be directly inferred. This was already described in a letter to the editor by Brogsitter et al. [19]. In a follow-up study, 15 patients were treated intra-arterially with a combination of   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATOC and   [ 90 Y]Y-DOTATOC, in which a response rate of 60% was reported [12]. In a substudy in the same study population, four patients underwent dynamic scintigraphy while receiving intra-arterial and intravenous administration of 111 In-DOTATOC, which showed significant wash-out after intra-arterial administration. An increased retention of activity in tumours was found at 1, 4, 24, 48 and 72 h after injection, but with diminishing differences over time. The same washout was shown by Pool et al., in three patients after intra-arterial administration of 111 In-DTPA-octreotide [13]. More recently, Lawhn-Heath et al. treated patients with G1-3 NET intra-arterially with a single cycle of   [ 90 Y]Y-DOTATOC [20]. The study was

halted after treating 10 patients, due to the minimal treatment efficacy as determined by the comparison of response rate of treated liver lesions with data from the NETTER-1 study. In five patients, co-injection of   [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC in the hepatic artery was performed, followed by PET/CT imaging and quantitative analysis and comparison with intravenous   [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC administration, which showed no significant difference in uptake in hepatic metastases either. However, competition of both used compounds for the SSTR may have resulted in differences in uptake between [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATOC and   [ 90 Y]Y-DOTATOC, complicating the interpretation of their results. In another study, Thakral et al. treated 15 patients with intra-arterial PRRT using [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE and compared the uptake in liver metastases with 14 patients who were treated intravenously. A threefold increase in T/N ratio from 25.6 to 78.5 between the two groups was reported [21]. Patient selection and treatment arm allocation however were not reported. Furthermore, differences between the two groups in terms of disease status, histopathology, previous treatments, and extrahepatic disease were unclear, while these factors may have significant impact on tumour uptake. These studies suggested, to a greater or to a lesser extent, that intra-arterial PRRT may increase tumour dose. The currently presented study shows no difference in tumour uptake after intra-arterial injection of   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE.

In the LUTIA study, four aspects may have contributed to the limited increase in T/N IA . First, the affinity for the   SST 2 receptor of   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE is by itself extremely high. Therefore, no increase in SSTR binding proportion can really be expected by increasing the concentration [22]. Second, subsequent internalization of the   SST 2 -[ 177 Lu]LuDOTATATE complex is fast and efficient (within minutes), and intracellular trapping of   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE lasts for several hours, significantly reducing binding sites on the outside of NELM tumour cells [23]. Therefore,   [ 177 Lu]LuDOTATATE is possibly mostly extracted from systemic circulation, instead of during first pass. Third, due to the highly vascularized nature of both the liver and metastases, circulatory exposure to   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE is already high. Finally, the peptide mass in the   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE solution administered differs depending on manufacturing procedures and may result in differences in the bound proportion of receptors, as part of the solution will consist of peptides not bound by radioactive 177 Lu. These 'cold' peptides still populate some of the   SST 2 receptors, preventing 'hot' peptides (i.e. bound by 177 Lu) to be bound and internalized by the neuroendocrine tumour cell, resulting in a lower tumour uptake [24]. When a solution with a low specific activity is used, there are less   SST 2 receptors available for binding with 'hot' peptides, limiting differences between intra-arterial or systemic exposure.

Besides these conceptual causes, the absence of a significant increase in tumour uptake, may also be partially attributable to a high variance in T/N ratios. In the current study population, T/N ratios varied between patients and within patients. Even using a within-patient study design, this high variance could not be completely removed. Some of the variance is explained by a small unavoidable mismatch between baseline CT and post-treatment SPECT/ CT. No factors could be identified associated with a higher uptake ratio in our patients, as a cause for the remaining variance. The liver lobe that was treated intra-arterially, the visually hypervascular appearance, nor the hepatic tumour burden were significantly associated with a change in T/N ratio. Furthermore, within-patient tumour heterogeneity in NELM is well-known, with approximately 40% of patients having different tumour grades in-between different metastases [25, 26].

There are some shortcomings to the current study. Firstly, the study design using in-patient comparison of intra-arterial versus intravenous administration does not allow for accurate estimation of true activity uptake in the control lobe, as the pharmacokinetics may differ when compared to regular intravenous application. Secondly, the study group was rather heterogeneous in terms of primary tumour, time since diagnosis, and liver involvement. Therefore, the power of the study was insufficient to show efficacy in subgroup analyses. Thirdly, it is unknown whether the 24 h timepoint is the best timepoint for measuring the uptake. Different results could be found when choosing a different timepoint, and cumulative activity cannot be directly inferred from the reported measurements. However, a sub study with multipletimepoint imaging was performed for dosimetric analyses, of which the analyses are still running. Lastly, one specific commercially available radiopharmaceutical compound was used (i.e. Lutathera®, Novartis). A different outcome may be possible when other radiopharmaceuticals are used, for example with different amounts of peptide.

There are still some challenges concerning intra-arterial PRRT that need to be addressed. First, as previously mentioned, different radiopharmaceuticals may be studied to show differences in tumour uptake after intra-arterial administration. This may be due to difference in peptide concentration,   SST 2 affinity, or differences in pharmacokinetics. Secondly, intra-arterial administration of   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE may be feasible when considering other indications besides NET, such as meningioma [27]. Other methods are available to enhance the effect of PRRT, for example with hepatic radioembolization. This combination was already shown to be both effective and safe when using 166 Holmium microspheres in the HEPAR PLuS study [28, 29]. Other potential combinations may include systemic treatments, as radiosensitizers or inhibiting DNA-repair mechanisms [30].

In conclusion, intra-arterial administration of   [ 177 Lu]LuDOTATATE in grade 1 to 2 NET yields a minimal nonsignificant increase in tumour uptake, without any effect on tumour response. This does not justify the intra-arterial administration of   [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTATATE in the patients with NELM.

## Glossary of terms

Assessment

A procedure used to generate data required by the study.

Biologic Samples

A  biological  specimen  including,  for  example,  blood  (plasma, serum), saliva, tissue, urine, stool, etc. taken from a study subject or study patient.

Control drug

A study treatment used as a comparator to reduce assessment bias, preserve  blinding  of  investigational  drug,  assess  internal  study validity, and/or evaluate comparative effects of the investigational drug.

Dose level

The dose of drug given to the patient (total daily or weekly etc.)

Enrollment

Point/time  of  patient  entry  into  the  study;  the  point  at  which informed consent must be obtained (i.e. prior to starting any of the procedures described in the protocol).

GEP-NET

Gastroenteropancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumors  a  rare  type  of tumor  that  can  form  in  the  pancreas  or  in  other  parts  of  the gastrointestinal  tract,  including  the  stomach,  small  intestine, colon, rectum, and appendix. Neuroendocrine tumors arising in the lung are not considered GEP-NETs.

Investigational drug

The study treatment whose properties are being tested in the study; this definition is consistent with US CFR 21 Section 312.3 and is synonymous with 'investigational new drug.'

Investigational treatment

Drug whose properties are being tested in the study as well as their associated placebo and active treatment controls (when applicable).  This  also  includes  approved  drugs  used  outside  of their  indication/approved  dosage,  or  that  are  tested  in  a  fixed combination. Investigational treatment generally does not include other study treatments administered as concomitant background therapy required or allowed by the protocol when used in within approved indication/dosage.

Medication number

A unique identifier on the label of each study treatment package which is linked to one of the treatment groups of a study.

Other study treatment

Any drug administered to the patient as part of the required study procedures that was not included in the investigational treatment.

Subject Number (Subject No.)

A unique identifying number assigned to each patient/subject/healthy volunteer who enrolls in the study.

Study Phase

A subdivision of the study timeline; divides stages into smaller functional segments such as screening, treatment, follow-up, etc.

Randomization number

A unique treatment identification code assigned to each randomized  patient,  corresponding  to  a  specific  treatment  arm assignment.

Confidential

Rescue therapy

A quick-relief or fast-acting medication besides the investigational drug or control that can alleviate symptoms due to disease or lack of efficacy of the study treatment. It acts quickly to stop symptoms and, the effects are not long-lasting.

Stage related to study timeline

A major subdivision of the study timeline; begins and ends with major study milestones such as enrollment, randomization, completion of treatment, etc.

Stage in cancer

The extent of a cancer in the body. Staging is usually based on the size  of  the  tumor,  whether  lymph  nodes  contain  cancer,  and whether the cancer has spread from the original site to other parts of the body.

Stop study participation

Point/time at which the patient came in for a final evaluation visit or when study treatment was discontinued whichever is later.

Study treatment

Includes any drug or combination of drugs in any study treatment administered to the patient (subject) as part of the required study procedures, including placebo and active drug run-ins.

In  specific  examples,  it  is  important  to  judge  investigational treatment  component  relationship  relative  to  a  study  treatment combination; study treatment in this case refers to the investigational and non-investigational treatments in combination.

Study treatment discontinuation

Point/time when patient permanently stops taking study treatment for any reason.

Variable

Identifier used in the data analysis; derived directly or indirectly from  data  collected  using  specified  assessments  at  specified timepoints.

Withdrawal of consent

Withdrawal of consent occurs only when a patient does not want to  participate  in  the  study  any  longer,  and  does  not  want  any further visits or assessments, and does not want any further study related contact.

| Purpose and rationale      | The pivotal Phase III NETTER-1 study showed that Lutathera with best supportive care (30mg octreotide long-acting) provided a significant increase in PFS to patients with progressive midgut carcinoid tumors (at enrollment) compared to patients treated with high dose (60 mg) octreotide long-acting. The NETTER-1 patient population included 34.5% of patients with G2 NET (65.5% G1), while G3 NETs were excluded. Only patients progressive on SSAs were eligible (2 nd line), SSA-naïve patients were excluded. The aim of the NETTER-2 study is to determine if Lutathera in combination with octreotide long-acting prolongs PFS in GEP-NET patients with high proliferation rate tumors (G2 and G3), when given as a 1 st line treatment in comparison to treatment with high dose (60 mg) octreotide long-acting. SSA-naïve patients are eligible, as well as patients previously treated with SSAs in the absence of progression. Based on extensive experience with Lutathera as well as octreotide LAR in adult GEP NET patients, and the relevance of the molecular target in adolescent GEP NET patients, the study will be open to adolescents aged ≥ 15 years and >40 kg body weight (BW); younger patients are not expected to present with the disease meeting the severity criteria for this trial. |
| Primary Objective(s)       | To demonstrate that Lutathera is superior to active comparator in delaying the time-to-first occurrence of progression or death (PFS) as first line treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Study design                 | Overall, 222 patients will be randomized (2:1 randomization ratio) to receive treatment with Lutathera (7.4GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8± 1 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800mCi) plus octreotide long-acting (30 mg every 8 weeks during Lutathera treatment and every 4 weeks after last Lutathera treatment) or high dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg every 4 weeks). Randomization will be stratified by Grade (G2 vs G3) and tumor origin (pNET vs other origin). The primary endpoint of the study is PFS centrally assessed (target HR=0.5; 90% power, 1-sided α=2.5%). The primary analysis will be performed after 99 PFS events (99 evaluable and centrally confirmed disease progressions or death events) have occurred. The study consists of a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, an optional Treatment Extension Phase (cross-over), an optional Re-treatment Phase and a Follow up Phase. Screening Phase The screening phase must be shortened as much as possible, in order to treat the patients possibly within 2 weeks after the consent signature. The randomization must be performed immediately after all eligibility criteria are verified. As Lutathera production and shipment will take circa 12 days to be arranged, if a patient is randomized in the Lutathera arm, |

At any time during the study (before or after the PFS primary analysis) any progressive  patient  (based  on  central  imaging  assessment)  immediately ceases the Treatment Phase and proceeds to the Follow-up Phase.  Patients who  experience  disease  progression  in  the  Lutathera  arm  after  having received  and  benefitted  from  4  doses/cycles  as  initial  treatment  have  the option,  if  eligible,  to  enroll  for  re-treatment  with  Lutathera.  In  addition, patients randomized in the control arm have the option, if eligible, to enroll for post-progression cross-over with Lutathera.

## Optional Treatment Extension Phase (cross-over)

In the control arm, any patient with radiological progression according to RECIST (based on central  assessment)  has  the  option  to  enroll  for  postprogression cross-over, upon signature of a new informed consent, to receive maximum 4 cycles of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 cycles; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq / 800mCi) plus 30 mg octreotide long acting every 8 weeks. If  RECIST progression occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis, the decision to enroll the patient in the cross-over phase will be based on local assessment. The time window to start Lutathera during the cross-over phase is within 4 years after the last patient has been randomized.

## Optional Re-treatment Phase

Patients  in  the  Lutathera  arm  with  radiological  progression  based  on RECIST  criteria  in  central  assessment  will  be  offered  enrollment  in  the optional re-treatment phase upon signature of a new informed consent. If RECIST  progression  occurs  after  Week  72  post  the  primary  end  point analysis, the decision to enroll the patient in re-treatment will be based on local assessment.

The  criteria to enter the  re-treatment  phase  include  achievement  of stabilization of disease or radiological response to Lutathera initial treatment for  at  least  6  months  after  receiving  the  4 th Lutathera  dose  and  good safety/tolerability. If a patient's response has changed from PR/CR to SD within 6 months after the 4 th Lutathera dose, the patient is still eligible for re-treatment, provided there is no documented progression within 6 months. Patients  who  received  other  systemic  treatments  for  GEP-NET  after progression (except somatostatin analogues) are not eligible for re-treatment. The time window to start re-treatment in this study is within 4 years after the last patient has been randomized.

In the re-treatment phase, patients will initially receive 2 administrations of Lutathera 7.4 GBq/200 mCi at 8-week interval. Based on the physician's judgment  of  the  clinical  benefit  derived  from  the  first  2  doses,  up  to  2 additional doses of Lutathera may be administered. A maximum of 4 cycles of  Lutathera  is  allowed  during  the  re-treatment  period.  All  safety  and efficacy  assessments in  the  re-treatment  period  will  be  performed  locally (SRI images must also be submitted to the central images reading center possibly within 1 month) and following the schedule in the initial treatment

period. Assessments will be continued until disease progression is documented by investigator or until End of Study, whichever occurs first.

## Follow up Phase

At the end of the Treatment Phase or after discontinuation for any cause (including disease progression), all patients will continue to be followed up to  3  years  to  continue  data  collection  for  the  secondary  endpoints  of  the study, such as long term safety and overall survival. Patients included in the optional  crossover  or  re-treatment  phase  will  be  followed  up  at  least  6 months and up to 3 years (or until EoS, whatever comes first).

During the Follow-up Phase, serious adverse events and adverse events of special  interest  (AESI)  related  to  the  study  treatment  as  well  as  AESI  of secondary  hematological  malignancies  irrespective  of  causality,  will  be reported. Anti-tumor treatments administered after progression/discontinuation, disease status based on local CT/MRI assessment, and OS data will be collected every 6 months in both arms.

## End of the Study

The End of Study is after 4 years have elapsed from the randomization of the last patient or 6 months after the last cross-over or re-treatment dose in the study, whichever occurs last.  The time window to start cross-over or retreatment with Lutathera in this study is within 4 years after the last patient has been randomized. For patients in the Lutathera arm who progress beyond this window, access to re-treatment with Lutathera may be granted via Post Study Drug Supply (PSDS) programs.

In this study, safety and efficacy of treatment with Lutathera plus octreotide long-acting  (30  mg)  versus  high  dose  octreotide  long-acting  (60  mg)  is evaluated  in  patients  ≥15  years  with  somatostatin  receptor  positive,  well differentiated G2 (Ki67 index ≥10% to ≤ 20%) and G3 (Ki67 &gt; 20% and ≤ 55%) advanced GEP-NETs.

In this study, approximately 222 patients with advanced G2-3 GEP-NET will be randomized (2:1 randomization ratio) to receive treatment with Lutathera (7.4 GBq or 200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8± 1 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6  GBq or 800 mCi) plus octreotide long-acting standard dose (30 mg every  8  weeks  during  Lutathera  treatment  and  every  4  weeks  after  last Lutathera  treatment)  or  octreotide  long-acting  high  dose  (60  mg  every  4 weeks).

The investigational drug product Lutathera ® ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate) will be provided by the Sponsor. The Sponsor will also provide the  2.5%  Lys-Arg  sterile  amino  acid  solution  for  infusion  (if  it  can't  be compounded at the hospital Pharmacy), as well as octreotide long-acting (Sandostatin ®   LAR Depot) for the entire duration of the Treatment Phase (and optional Treatment Extension Phase in case of cross-over) of the study. During the re-treatment period, Lutathera ®  and 2.5% Lys-Arg sterile amino acid  solution  for  infusion  (if  it  can't  be  compounded  at  the  hospital Pharmacy)  will  be  provided  by  the  Sponsor.  Patients  will  switch  to prescribed drugs in the follow up phase.

Anti-emetics,  SRI  imaging  agents,  short-acting  octreotide  or  any  other supportive care medication will not be supplied by the Sponsor.

During the Treatment Phase, objective tumor response will be assessed at W16±1, W24±1 and then every 12±1 weeks from the randomization date, according  to  RECIST  1.1  criteria  (central  +  local  assessment  up  to  first progression,  then  only  local  assessment).  During  the  Follow  up  Phase RECIST objective tumor response will be assessed locally (scans every 6 months).

Patients in the control arm (all countries except for China) will yield PK data from blood sampling performed at pre-dose with respect to the octreotide long-acting i.m. injection for the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 7th treatment cycle (that is  respectively at week 4, 12, 16 and 24) for the determination of plasma trough levels. Data will be processed using a population based model, for exploratory purposes.

| Data analysis            | The primary efficacy and safety analyses will be performed after observing approximately 99 PFS events. At that time a soft database lock will ensure the integrity of the data and make further data entry for the continuation of the trial possible. The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be assessed via central review according to RECIST 1.1. The following statistical hypotheses will be tested to address the primary efficacy objective: H 01 (null hypotheses): Θ 1 ≥ 0 vs. H a1 (alternative hypotheses): Θ 1 < 0 Where Θ 1 is the log hazard ratio of PFS in the Lutathera plus Standard Dose octreotide long-acting (30 mg) (investigational) arm vs. High Dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg) (control) arm. The primary efficacy analysis to test this hypothesis and compare the two treatment groups will consist of a stratified log-rank test at an overall one- sided 2.5% level of significance in favor of the Lutathera plus Standard Dose octreotide long-acting (30 mg) arm. The stratification will be based on the following randomization stratification factors (grade: G2 vs. G3; and tumor origin: pNET vs other origin). Secondary objectives of the study are to compare the two treatment groups with respect to objective response rate, time to deterioration in selected EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-G.I.NET21 QoL items/scales, disease control rate, duration of response, safety and overall survival. Objective response rate and time to deterioration in EORTC QLQ-C30 global health status, diarrhea, fatigue, and pain are identified as key secondary endpoints. A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the overall type I error in assessing the primary and key secondary objectives. |

## Protocol Amendment 2.0

## Amendment rationale

At the time of this amendment release, patient recruitment in the study is completed (222 patients randomized as of September 28 th , 2022).

The primary purpose of amendment version 2.0 is to implement modifications in contraception requirements in line with Lutathera Investigator's Brochure (IB) version 17, dated 09 March 2022. The IB and corresponding changes in the informed consent form (ICF) were sent after the release to all enrolling sites and shared with IRBs/ECs as needed.

The  changes  are  based  on  Sponsor  Guideline  on  Prevention  of  Pregnancies  in  Participants  in Clinical Trials as well as the Clinical Trials Facilitation and Coordination Group (CTFG) guideline on recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials. According to these guidelines, for radioligand therapies, highly effective contraception should be used during treatment and for (5 x T ½ + 6 months) after treatment in women of childbearing potential, and condom should be used during treatment and contraception period in male patients. For Lutathera, the effective half-life is 49 hours, and therefore, as per the calculation, the period of contraception for female patients should continue for 6 months and 10 days after the last dose. However, as a precautionary measure, the Sponsor decided to extend the highly effective contraception period from 6 months to 7 months for female patients.

In addition, the contraception requirements for male patients have been modified by specifying the use of condom and highly effective methods of contraception with female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners during the treatment period (including cross-over and retreatment, if applicable) and for 4 months after study drug discontinuation. This duration is based on  an  exposure  of  5  terminal  half-lives  (49  hours  for  Lutathera)  plus  90  day  (life  span  of spermatozoa of 60-75 days for sperm production + 10-14 days for transport to epididymis) (EMA 'Safety Working Party recommendations on the duration of contraception following the end of treatment with a genotoxic drug' dated on 27-Feb-2020).

This protocol amendment also includes the following updates:

- It has been clarified that based on Lutathera mechanism of action as a radioligand therapy, it can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant women.
- Some minor updates  were  made  to  the  language  regarding  the  objective  response  rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) in the objective, assessments, and statistical sections of the protocol.
- According to  the  global  Sponsor  position,  Lutathera  should  be  infused  slowly  with  an infusion  rate up  to 400  mL/hr,  depending  on  the  patient  venous  status,  resulting  in  a duration of the infusion time of 30 ± 10 minutes. The wording 'up to' was missing in the previous protocol version, and has been added now.
- Sterile conditions of amino acid solution infusion have been specified in order to emphasize that sterile solution is required for infusion.
- An error in the formula to calculate creatinine clearance has been noted and corrected.

Protocol No. CAAA601A22301

- It has been clarified that serum chromogranin A (CgA) assessment is discontinued in Q3 2022 in South Korea due to lab kits shortage in the country. CgA assessments performed before  discontinuation  will  be  included  in  the  analyses.  This  discontinuation  does  not impact study primary, secondary or exploratory objectives.
- It has been clarified that CT/MRI scan does not need to be repeated at EOT/EOS visits if it has been already done shortly before the visits.
- The sentence mentioning that in case of discrepancies between the local and central tumor response assessment 'the Investigator may request the assessment by a third evaluator for final adjudication' has been removed. This option is actually not foreseen in this study. The central review is independent, performed by two reviewers, with adjudication by a 3 rd independent reviewer in case of discrepancy between the first two. As per process, the central review is not impacted by the local response assessment.
- It  has  been  clarified  that  if  a  patient  discontinues  Lutathera  before  confirmed  disease progression, the patient should be followed with tumor assessments as per initial CT/MRI schedule until confirmed disease progression. This is done via central assessment in the initial Lutathera treatment, and via local assessment in the Lutathera re-treatment phase.
- A typo related to Karnofsky Performance score (KPS) evaluation has been corrected in the assessment schedule. Protocol section 8.5.7 states: ' KPS forms must be completed by a medical professional at each treatment and follow-up visit'; however, the assessment was not added in error in the control arm (Table 8-4) assessment schedule with the protocol amendment version 1.0 (typo). This typo in Table 8-4 is now corrected.
- Added clarification on applicable processes in case of Lutathera supply disruption and/or quality finding.
- Added clarification on patient management in regards to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
- Added clarification on informed consent withdrawal.
- Added clarification on study documents retention.
- Added clarifications on SSTR uptake assessment in somatostatin receptor imaging and CT/MRI scans for cross-over and re-treatment eligibility visits.
- Added clarification on management of CT/MRI scans after the second progression (PFS2) during the follow-up period
- Added clarifications on allowed time window for follow-up visits and re-treatment start.
- Added clarification on concomitant medication collection during follow-up phase.
- Added clarifications on CT/MRI scans scheduled during cross-over/re-treatment phase.
- Added  clarification  on  EORTC  QoL  scales  which  are  captured  in  the  key  secondary analysis
- Added a footnote in the Dose modification table clarifying that lymphopenia is not a dose modifying toxicity.
- Editorial changes and text corrections made for clarification, where required.

## Protocol Amendment 1.0

## Amendment rationale

At the time of this amendment release, patient recruitment in the study is ongoing. A total of 123 patients have been randomized in the study as of September 23 rd , 2021. The amendment does not affect the primary and key secondary endpoints of the study.

The protocol has been amended for the following reasons:

## Addition of Re-treatment phase:

The main purpose of this protocol amendment is to introduce optional re-treatment with additional  doses  of  Lutathera  for  patients  treated  in  the  Lutathera  arm  upon  disease progression. Once  patients experience  disease progression,  they  may  receive  any subsequent  antineoplastic  treatment.  Based  on  a  meta-analysis  (Strosberg  et  al.,  2021) including patients with progressive GEP-NETs (n=560) who received re-treatment with Lutathera (one to six doses during re-treatment, majority of patients received 200 mCi per administration), median PFS was 12.52 months (available in 414 patients), median OS was 26.78 months from the start of re-treatment (available in 194 patients), and DCR was 71% (available in 347 patients) supporting the clinical benefit of re-treatment. The safety profile of Lutathera re-treatment was similar to initial treatment. Hematologic grade 3/4 AEs were reported in 9% of patients who received PRRT re-treatment. Notably, AML and MDS occurred in &lt;1% of patients who received re-treatment with Lutathera, comparable to the incidence observed with initial PRRT (2% in the studies included in the meta-analysis). These data indicate  that  re-treatment  with  Lutathera  may  be  considered  as  a  treatment approach to maximize benefit without compromising on safety upon careful assessment of clinical status of each individual patient.

Based on this body of evidence, the patient candidates for re-treatment with Lutathera in this  protocol  amendment,  are  patients  with  centrally  documented  tumor  progression  in Lutathera arm (if RECIST progression occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis,  the  decision  to  enroll  the  patient  in  re-treatment  will  be  based  on  local assessment),  who have completed the 4 doses/cycles of Lutathera during the treatment phase, had CR/PR/SD as best response for at least 6 months after the 4 th Lutathera dose, and had tolerated the treatment (according to criteria defined in Section 5.2.2). An SSTR uptake must be documented in target lesions by SRI before starting re-treatment.

Patients  will  be  offered  to  receive  initially  two  Lutathera  doses  in  re-treatment  period (Section 4.3). Based on the physician judgment of clinical benefit derived from the first 2 doses, patients may receive up to 2 additional doses of Lutathera (criteria for additional doses are listed in Section 3.4). A maximum of 4 doses of Lutathera is allowed during the re-treatment period.

All safety and efficacy assessments in the re-treatment period will be performed as per the schedule  in  initial  treatment  period  (Table  8-2)  and  will  be  continued  until  disease progression is documented by investigator.

Protocol No. CAAA601A22301

A descriptive analysis will be performed in all patients who received Lutathera re-treatment (Section 12.6.4). Safety will be presented in a similar manner to that in Section 12.5.3. All efficacy analyses for ORR, DoR, PFS, PFS2, and OS will be descriptive.  Definitions for ORR, DoR, and PFS (as per local assessment) are the same definitions in Section 12.5.2 except  that  the  baseline  will  be  based  on  the  tumor  assessment  which  demonstrated progression thus allowing re-treatment with Lutathera.  Definitions for OS and PFS2 are the same to that in Section 12.5.2 and Section 12.6.1, respectively.

The assessment of Lutathera re-treatment has been added as an exploratory objective in the study: To explore the safety and efficacy (ORR, PFS, PFS2, DoR, OS) of re-treatment with Lutathera in progressive patients in Lutathera arm .  The following exploratory endpoints have been added:

- -Safety  (Re-treatment):  Rate  of  adverse  events  and  laboratory  toxicities  during  retreatment with Lutathera.
- -ORR  (Re-treatment):  Rate  of  complete  and  partial  responses  after  receiving  retreatment with Lutathera (CR, PR) (locally assessed according to RECIST 1.1).
- -PFS (Re-treatment): Time from the 1st dose of re-treatment with Lutathera to objective tumor progression (locally assessed according to RECIST 1.1) or to death due to any cause.
- -PFS2 (Re-treatment):  Time  from  randomization  to  the  objective  tumor  progression (locally assessed according to RECIST 1.1) or to death due to any cause after receiving re-treatment with Lutathera.
- -DOR (Re-treatment): Time from initially meeting the criteria for response (CR or PR) after receiving re-treatment with Lutathera until the time of progression according to RECIST 1.1 (locally assessed) or death due to underlying disease only.
- -OS (Re-treatment): Time from the randomization date until the day of death due to any cause in patients who have received re-treatment with Lutathera.

## Other Protocol changes

- Dose modification rules have been updated, to clarify that toxicities meeting DMT criteria which are resolved before the next scheduled dose will not trigger a dose reduction (Section 6.5.2.1). The dose modification rules in the initial protocol reflected Lutathera label DMT guidance.  However,  patients  in  NETTER-2  have  higher  grade  tumors  (G2  and  G3)  as compared to the patients in the approved label (G1 and G2); therefore, the administration of a full dose (200 mCi/7.4 GBq) if a toxicity is resolved, even if this toxicity met DMT criteria, is considered to maximize the potential treatment effects. Therefore, in view of the higher GEP-NET severity in the NETTER-2 study, and in order to maintain a positive benefit/risk ratio, the protocol has been amended in Section 6.5.2.1. There are no changes to requirements for dose interruption if a toxicity is not resolved, nor to requirements for treatment discontinuation (Section 6.5.2, Section 6.5.3).

- Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been modified for clarity and consistency
- o Inclusion  criterion  4:  amended  to  include  all  available  SSTR-directed  imaging agents and modalities to evaluate baseline expression of somatostatin receptors on target lesions. The following imaging agents and modalities were added: [99mTc]Tektrotyd,  [64Cu]-DOTA-TATE  PET/CT;  in  addition,  option  of  PET/MRI  has been  added  to  all  PET  imaging  modalities  (when  applicable  based  on  target lesions).
- o Inclusion criterion 5: amended to delete the second part of the sentence 'The tumor uptake observed in the target lesions must be &gt; normal liver uptake observed on planar imaging' (removed as not applicable in all SRI methods).
- o Exclusion criterion 6: amended to specify in exclusion criteria the contraception methods and sperm donation recommendation during the study for sexually active male patients, separately from requirements for female patients (important details were listed in the Appendix 1 but missing in the exclusion criteria). In addition, Appendix 1 was updated to align with CTFG guidelines for contraception (v1.1, Sep 2020).
- o Exclusion criterion 10: amended to specify in exclusion criteria that only systemic therapies for the studied disease (GEP-NET) are excluded (if administered for more than 1 month or within 12 weeks prior to randomization).
- o Exclusion criterion 11: amended to specify in exclusion criteria that only previous radioembolization, chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation for the studied disease (GEP-NET) are excluded.
- o Exclusion criterion 13: amended to clarify that MRI is acceptable for assessment of brain metastasis, in addition to CT.
- o Exclusion criterion 14: amended to clarify that congestive heart failure history can be assessed via echocardiography only (gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography is not required).
- o Exclusion criterion 16: amended as the definition of uncontrolled diabetes ('fasting blood glucose &gt; 2 ULN') was non-standard; the revised definition is 'hemoglobin A1c &gt; 7.5%' (NICE guideline on Type 2 diabetes in adults: management, 2015).
- o Exclusion criterion 18: amended to delete the second part of Exclusion Criterion 18, which is irrelevant in this study as the tumor uptake on target lesions must be greater  than  the  liver  uptake  in  all  patients  in  this  study  (typo  correction)  (as described  in  inclusion  criteria  5): 'Any  patient  receiving  treatment  with  shortacting octreotide, which cannot be interrupted for 24 h before and 24 h after the administration  of  Lutathera,  or  any  patient  receiving  treatment  with  SSAs  (eg octreotide long-acting), which cannot be interrupted for at least 6 weeks before the administration of Lutathera, unless the tumor uptake on target lesions observed by study permitted somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) modalities during continued long acting  SSA  treatment  is  greater  than  the  liver  uptake  observed  by  planar imaging.'
- o Exclusion criterion 24: amended to exclude patients with hypersensitivity to the IMPs active substance or to any of the excipients.

- Included  list  of  possible  Octreotide  Drug-Drug-Interactions  (DDI)  in  Section  6.2.3, according to the Octreotide label.
- Clarified requirements for contraception (Section 8.5.3 and Appendix 1).
- Added Section 9.2.1 to clarify that for patients who are eligible to Lutathera re-treatment beyond  the  EoSs  window  a  may  receive  post-trial  access  (PTA)  to  Lutathera.  PTA  to Lutathera may be granted via Post Study Drug Supply (PSDS) programs, based on local regulation in a non-trial setting. The PSDS must comply with local laws and regulations in the participating trial countries.
- Added clarifications on safety reporting procedures in Section 10.
- o During the treatment phase, all SAEs and AESI need to be reported to the Sponsor irrespective of causality. During the follow-up phase, SAEs and AESI need to be reported only if considered related to the study treatment except for all secondary hematological  malignancies  which  need  to  be  reported  as  AESI  irrespective  of causality.
- o Clarified  the  4  categories  of  AESI  (Hematotoxicity;  Secondary  hematological malignancies; Nephrotoxicity; Cardiovascular and electrolyte disorders) (Table 101), and removed the table with AESI by treatment type, as AESI must be reported for both arms.
- o Clarified that serious adverse events (SAEs) must be reported immediately, without undue delay and under no circumstances later than 24 hours following knowledge.
- o Clarified that progression of GEP-NET (including fatal outcomes), if documented by use of appropriate method, should not be reported as a serious adverse event, except if  the  investigator  considers  that  progression  of  malignancy  is  related  to study treatment.
- Explained  methods  of  providing  continuing  care  to  the  patients  during  COVID-19 pandemic (Sections 8, 8.2, 8.5.1, 8.5.2, 9.1.1, 10.1.1, 10.1.2, 14).
- Updated definition of EoS in Section 9.2: End of Study (EOS) is after 4 years have elapsed from the randomization of the last patient, or 6 months after the last dose of crossed over/retreatment patient, which occurs last.
- Section 12 has been updated as follows:
- Corrected the PFS definition throughout the document to align with currently approved Section 12.4.1 that define the PFS as follows: 'The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause.'
- Added statistical hypothesis information in the protocol synopsis for the data analysis sub-section.
- Updated  language  for  PFS2  endpoint  in  the  Objectives  and  Endpoints  section  to improve clarity.

- Updated definition for DOR throughout protocol as follows (addition in bold/italic ): 'DOR: The Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from initially meeting the criteria for response (CR or PR) until the time of progression according to RECIST 1.1 or to death due to underlying disease only '
- Updated  language  at  the  beginning  of  Section  12  to  further  highlight  the  primary objective and the timing of analyses throughout the study.

## 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Background

Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare malignant neoplasms that can arise throughout the body, and account for approximately 1% of all human tumors. NETs have been classified according to their  embryonic  origin  as  foregut,  midgut,  or  hindgut  NETs.  The  World  Health  Organization (WHO) staging system classifies gastroenteropancreatic NET (GEP-NET) based on primary tumor localization, size, mitotic activity, invasiveness, and functional status (Klöppel, 2011). Despite certain common morphological and immunohistochemical features, there is significant heterogeneity in the prognosis and treatment strategies according to the primary site, histological differentiation (poorly or well-differentiated) and stage. Histologic differentiation and proliferative activity are the strongest predictors of survival. In terms of site of origin, the majority (50-70%) of NETs diagnosed in Western countries are gastrointestinal NETs (Modlin, Lye, &amp; Kidd, 2003). Of 270 NETs originating in the midgut or hindgut, 62% (5- year survival rate (YSR), 95.2%) were Grade 1, 32% (5-YSR 82.0%) were Grade 2, and 6% (5-YSR, 51.4%) were Grade 3 NETs (Jann, et al., 2011). 50-70% of NETs of unknown origin have been reported to be well-differentiated (Catena,  et  al.,  2011)  and  have  a  similar  behavior  and  prognosis  to  midgut  NETs  (Kirshbom, Kherani, Onaitis, Feldman, &amp; Tyler, 1998).

Surgical resection of the primary and metastatic lesions remains the mainstay of treatment, and the only way to obtain a cure. However, resection is often not possible as NETs are frequently detected in a more advanced tumor stage (Yao, et al., 2008).

In patients with inoperable NET, the treatment goal is to prolong survival, improve and maintain quality  of  life,  to  control  tumor  growth,  and  to  control  secretory  symptoms  (if  the  tumor  is functional). Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) octreotide long-acting 30 mg (Sandostatin ®  LAR ® ) or lanreotide  ATG  120  mg  (lanreotide  ATG,  SOMATULINE ®   DEPOT  or  SOMATULINE ® AUTOGEL ® ) have become the mainstay of treatment in patients with low- or intermediate-grade GEP-NET.

In the PROMID study, 42 patients with metastatic midgut NET who received octreotide longacting 30 mg/month had more than double the time to tumor progression compared with 43 patients who  received  placebo  (14.3  versus  6.0  months,  respectively;  P=0.000072).  Overall,  67%  of patients treated with octreotide long-acting achieved stable disease compared with 37% of patients who received placebo (Rinke, et al., 2009). In the CLARINET study, patients with G1-2 midgut and  pancreatic  NET  treated  with  lanreotide  120  mg/month  had  significant  prolongation  of progression free  survival  (PFS)  when  compared  to  placebo  (median  PFS  not  reached  vs.  18.0 months, P&lt;0.001; HR for progression or death with lanreotide vs. placebo, 0.47; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.73) (Caplin, et al., 2014).

Where approved, the dose for octreotide long-acting for the treatment of advanced midgut NET is 30 mg/month.  Higher doses of octreotide up to 120 mg per month have been used for symptom control in patients no longer responding adequately to standard doses. Higher doses have also been used  for  tumor  control  though  controlled  studies  are  lacking  (Broder,  Beenhouwer,  Strosberg, Neary,  &amp;  Cherepanov,  2015).  Three  studies  have  investigated  the  antiproliferative  efficacy  of high-dose treatment with either octreotide long-acting (up to 160 mg every 2 weeks) or lanreotide (up to 15 mg/d), showing disease stabilization in 37-75% of advanced midgut carcinoid and/or metastatic  GEP-NET  patients  (Eriksson,  Renstrup,  Imam,  &amp;  Oberg,  1997;  Faiss,  et  al.,  1999; Welin, et al., 2004).

Furthermore, retrospective analyses suggest that higher doses of octreotide may delay the time to tumor progression / other types of intervention (Lau, Abdel-Rahman, &amp; Cheung, 2018; Chadha, et al., 2009). In a small (n=28) sequential study, increased frequency of dosing of somatostatin analogs  resulted  in  delayed  time  to  tumor  progression  and  time  to  biochemical  progression (Ferolla, et al., 2012).

In patients whose disease has progressed, mTOR therapy (everolimus), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib) and peptide radionuclide receptor therapy (PRRT) provide treatment options (Yao, et al.,  2010;  Yao,  et  al.,  2011;  Pavel,  et  al.,  2011;  Yao,  et  al.,  2016;  Kwekkeboom  &amp;  Krenning, Peptide  Receptor  Radionuclide  Therapy  in  the  Treatment  of  Neuroendocrine  Tumors.,  2016). Currently  there  is  no  broadly  accepted  standard  chemotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  NET.  A combination of streptozotocin and 5-flourouracil or doxorubicin is frequently used in patients with well-differentiated pancreatic NET (PNET), with inoperable progressive liver metastasis, but there is no robust evidence to support the use of chemotherapy in patients with NETs of other origin (Pavel, et al., 2012).

Within the group of neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) G3, the distinction between NET G3 and neuroendocrine  carcinomas  (NEC)  G3  is  clinically  meaningful.  NET  G3  and  NEC  are characterized by significant differences in Ki67 index (tumors with a Ki67 index between 20 and 55%  are  less  aggressive  than  tumors  with  a  Ki67  index  above  55%).  While  platinum-based chemotherapy  is  effective  in  NEC,  it  seems  to  have  limited  value  in  NET  G3 . Treatments established for NET G2 such as temozolomide based chemotherapy or PRRT may be considered for the treatment of NET G3 (Rinke 2017).

Tumor-targeted peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has been under clinical evaluation since 1992 for tumors expressing somatostatin receptors. The biological basis for radionuclide receptor imaging and receptor targeted radionuclide therapy is the receptor-mediated internalization and intracellular retention of radiolabelled somatostatin analogues. Sst2  receptors are an attractive target for PRRT because the receptor density is higher on tumor than on nontumor  tissue  (Reubi,  Waser,  Schaer,  &amp;  Laissue,  2001;  Reubi  J.  C.,  2003),  and  because  sst2 receptors internalize into cells after ligand binding. Consequently, the radioactivity delivered by the radiolabelled peptide is captured in the target cell after binding to the sst2 receptor (Reubi, et al., 2000).

177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate  ( 177 Lu-Dotatate,  Lutathera ® )  consists  of  a  somatostatin  peptide analogue, coupled to the metal-ion chelating moiety, DOTA, and radiolabelled with 177 Lu. 177 LuDOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate binds with high-affinity to somatostatin receptors and retains its binding properties  and  physiological  functions  when  complexed  with 177 Lu. 177 Lu  emits  low  to intermediate-energy beta-particles with an Emax of 0.5 MeV, and which have a tissue penetration range of up to 2 mm. The relatively short penetration range of 177 Lu betas leaves more of the radiation dose in the tumor with less loss to the surrounding tissues.

There  is rapid urinary clearance  of radiolabelled 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate  from  the circulation, which gives this radiopharmaceutical a major advantage over other approaches, such as cell targeted radiolabelled antibodies.

Because  of 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate  mechanism  of  action,  there  is  some  radioactivity retention  in  the  kidneys,  however  concomitant  administration  of  the  amino  acids  lysine  and arginine reduces renal uptake of radioactivity without altering tumor uptake (Kwekkeboom, et al., 2001; Strosberg, et al., 2017). This phenomenon of protection mediated by co-infusion of a lysine

and arginine solution occurs by 'blocking' the mechanism for renal tubular uptake of proteins or peptides (Hammond, et al., 1993; Rolleman, Valkema, Jong, Kooij, &amp; Krenning, 2003). The coadministration  of  2.5%  lysine  and  arginine  (Lys-Arg)  amino  acid  solution  yields  about  33% inhibition  of  renal  uptake  of  radioactivity  at  24  hours  and  is  better  tolerable  compared  to  the commercial amino acid solutions, specifically in terms of nausea and vomiting, due to the higher osmolality of the more complex formulated commercial AA solutions (Rolleman, Valkema, Jong, Kooij, &amp; Krenning, 2003; Kwekkeboom, et al., 2008).

Common  side  effects  of  Lutathera  include  lymphopenia,  increased  GGT,  AST  and/or  ALT, vomiting,  nausea,  hyperglycemia  and  hypokalemia.  Serious  side  effects  of  Lutathera  include myelosuppression, secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia, renal toxicity, hepatotoxicity, neuroendocrine hormonal crises and infertility.

Lutathera (lutetium ( 177 Lu) oxodotreotide) was approved in Europe on September 26, 2017 for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated (G1 and G2) GEP-NETs and in the USA on 26 January 2018 for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive GEP-NETs.

The approval of Lutathera was supported by two studies:

- ­ The first was the Phase III NETTER-1 study sponsored by Advanced Accelerator Applications. This  was  multicenter,  stratified,  open,  randomized,  comparator-controlled,  parallel-group study, comparing treatment with 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate (Lutathera, lutetium Lu 177 dotatate) plus best supportive care (30 mg octreotide long-acting) to treatment with high dose (60  mg)  octreotide  long-acting  in  patients  with  inoperable,  somatostatin  receptor  positive, histologically  proven  midgut  carcinoid  tumors,  progressive  under  octreotide  long-acting (Strosberg, et al., 2017; Strosberg, et al., 2018). A significant improvement in PFS, the primary endpoint, was demonstrated. There were 21 confirmed events (disease progressions according to RECIST 1.1 centrally assessed or deaths without confirmed progression) in the Lutathera arm and 70 events in the octreotide long-acting 60 mg arm. The median PFS for the control arm was 8.5 months while the median PFS for the Lutathera arm had not yet been reached. The  improvement  in  median  PFS  in  the  Lutathera  arm  was  statistically  significant  with  a hazard  ratio  of  0.18  (95%  CI,  0.11  -  0.29),  demonstrating  a  risk  reduction  of  79%  in  the likelihood of having a progression or death event when treated with Lutathera versus 60mg octreotide long-acting.
- ­ The second study was based on data from 1,214 patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors, including GEP-NETS, who received Lutathera at the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands (Kwekkeboom, et al., 2008; Brabander, et al., Long-Term Efficacy, Survival, and Safety  of  [177Lu-DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate  in  Patients  with  Gastroenteropancreatic  and Bronchial Neuroendocrine Tumors., 2017a). Complete or partial tumor remission was reported in 39% of patients.

On June 02, 2016 and 15 December, 2016 Advanced Accelerator Applications obtained marketing approval from the FDA for NETSPOT ™  (68Ga-Dotatate) and from the European Commission for Somakit-TOC ™  (68Ga-Dotatoc), the diagnostic companions of Lutathera.

Neuroendocrine  tumors  (NET)  are  rarely  seen  in  childhood.  The  incidence  in  children  and adolescents is low at 2.8 per million persons under the age of 30 years. Despite their low incidence, NETs  represent  the  most  frequent  tumor  of  the  gastrointestinal  tract  in  children  (Howell  &amp; O'Dorisio, 2012). Currently all treatments approved for GEP-NETs are for adults only.

## 1.2 Purpose

The pivotal Phase III NETTER-1 study showed that Lutathera with best supportive care (30mg octreotide long-acting) provided a significant increase in PFS to patients with progressive midgut carcinoid tumors (at enrollment) compared to patients treated with high dose (60 mg) octreotide long-acting. The NETTER-1 patient population included 34.5% of patients with G2 NET (65.5% G1), while G3 NETs were excluded. Only patients progressive on SSAs were eligible (2 nd line), SSA-naïve patients were excluded.

The aim of the NETTER-2 study is to determine if Lutathera in combination with octreotide longacting prolongs PFS in GEP-NET patients with high proliferation rate tumors (G2 and G3), when given as a 1 st line treatment in comparison to treatment with high dose (60 mg) octreotide longacting. SSA-naïve patients are eligible, as well as patients previously treated with SSAs in the absence of progression. Based on extensive experience with Lutathera as well as octreotide LAR in  adult  GEP-NET patients, and the relevance of the molecular target in adolescent GEP-NET patients, the study will be open to adolescents aged ≥ 15 years and &gt;40 kg body weight (BW); younger patients are not expected to present with the disease meeting the severity criteria for this trial. Due to the rarity of the disease, and specifically GEP-NETs with the severity assessed in this study,  no  minimum  number  of  adolescent  patients  is  required.  The  study  has  been  open  to adolescents to ensure that access is not unnecessarily denied.

In addition, in the NETTER-2 study, any progressive patient in the high dose octreotide long acting arm has the option, if eligible, to enroll for post-progression cross-over with Lutathera.

Furthermore,  patients  who  experience  disease  progression  in  the  Lutathera  arm  after  having received  and  benefitted  from  4  doses/cycles  in  an  initial  treatment  have  the  option,  if  eligible according to criteria described in Section 5.2.2, to enroll for re-treatment phase with Lutathera.

The purpose of the NETTER-2 study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lutathera in patients ≥15 years  of  age  with  Grade  2  and  3  advanced  GEP-NET  (Ki67  index  of ≥ 10  and ≤ 55%), considered being a candidate for treatment with high dose octreotide long-acting.

## 3 design Study

Ihis is a multicenter; stratified, randomized; open-label comparator-controlled, Phase III study in patients 215 years with somatostatin receptor positive, well-differentiated G2 and G3, advanced GEP NETs, diagnosed within 6 months to screening. prior

Overall,   222 patients will be randomized (2:1 randomization ratio) to receive treatment  with Lutathera  (7.4GBq/200 mCi X 4 administrations   every 8+ 1 weeks;  cumulative  dose: 29.6 GBq/8OOmCi) plus octreotide long-acting (30 mg every 8 weeks during Lutathera treatment and every 4 weeks after last Lutathera treatment) or high dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg every 4 weeks) . Randomization will be stratified by Grade (G2 vs G3) and tumor origin (pNET vs other origin) (Figure 3-1).

SPatients included in the optional cross-over or re-treatment phase will be followed up for 3 years or until EoS, whichever occurs first.

For additional details on the efficacy and safety assessments schedule by visit, see Table 8-3,and Table 8-4.

Figure 3-1. Study Design

The primary endpoint of the study is PFS centrally assessed (target HR=0.5; 90% power, 1-sided α=2. 5%). The primary analysis will be performed after 99 PFS events (99 evaluable and centrally confirmed disease progressions or death events) have occurred.

The study consists of a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, an optional Treatment Extension Phase (cross-over) / an optional Re-treatment Phase and a Follow up Phase.

## 3.1 Screening Phase

The screening phase should be shortened as much as possible, in order to treat the patients possibly within 2 weeks after the consent signature.

The randomization should be performed as soon as possible, after all eligibility criteria are verified. Patients  under  octreotide  long-acting  before  study  entry  should  have  their  last  dose  carefully programmed during the screening phase (in case of randomization in the Lutathera arm a washout period of 6 weeks from octreotide long-acting must be observed prior to Lutathera injection).

As  Lutathera  production  and  shipment  will  take  circa  12  days  to  be  arranged,  if  a  patient  is randomized  in  the  Lutathera  arm,  Lutathera  first  dose  should  be  ordered  within  24h  after randomization.

The  baseline  CT/MRI  scan  should  be  taken  possibly  on  the  same  day  as  randomization  or immediately before (within 1 week) to ensure that it reflects the disease status closely before the therapy start.

## 3.2 Treatment Phase

During the Treatment Phase, patients will be followed according to the assessments schedule in Table 8-3, and Table 8-4. Objective tumor response will be assessed at W16±1, W24±1 and then every 12±1 weeks from the randomization date, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria (central + local assessment up to first progression, then only local assessment).

Duration of the Treatment Phase:

- Before the PFS primary analysis:

The Treatment Phase is not fixed and the patients who are randomized should continue to receive the study treatments until progression or death (patients randomized in the Lutathera arm,  will  continue  octreotide  long-acting  30  mg  injections  after  the  completion  of  the  4 Lutathera treatments until progression or death; patients randomized in the octreotide longacting arm will continue octreotide long-acting 60 mg injections until progression or death).

- After the PFS primary analysis:

The Treatment Phase becomes fixed and will stop at week 72 (patients randomized in the Lutathera arm, will continue octreotide long-acting 30 mg injections after the completion of the 4 Lutathera treatments until week 72 or earlier in case of progression or death; patients randomized  in  the  octreotide  long-acting  arm  will  continue  octreotide  long-acting  60  mg injections until week 72 or earlier in case of progression or death).

Confidential

In other words, before the PFS primary analysis (i.e. 99 evaluable and centrally confirmed disease progressions or death events), patients continue the Treatment Phase until progression; after the PFS primary analysis, the Treatment Phase duration is limited to 72 weeks.

At any time during the study (before or after the PFS primary analysis) any progressive patient (based on central imaging assessment) immediately ceases the Treatment Phase and proceeds to the Follow-up Phase (Table 8-3 and Table 8-4). If a patient discontinues Lutathera before centrally confirmed disease progression, the patient should be followed with tumor assessments as per initial CT/MRI schedule until centrally confirmed disease progression.

In addition, patients randomized in the control arm have the option, if eligible, to enroll for postprogression cross-over with Lutathera, see Table 8-4). Control arm patients who cross-over after progression will be allowed to complete the Lutathera treatments after week 72 or to cross-over during the Follow-up Phase, in case of late progression. Furthermore, patients who experience disease progression in the Lutathera arm have the option, if eligible, to enroll for re-treatment phase with Lutathera, see Table 8-3.

Patients included in the optional crossover or re-treatment phase will be followed up at least 6 months and up to 3 years (or until EoS, whatever comes first).

## 3.3 Optional Treatment Extension Phase (cross-over)

In the control arm, any RECIST progressive patient (based on central assessment) has the option to enroll for post-progression cross-over, upon signature of a new consent, to receive maximum 4 cycles of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 cycles; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq / 800mCi) plus 30 mg octreotide long acting every 8 weeks.

If RECIST progression occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis, the decision to enroll the patient in cross-over will be based on local assessment.

The cross-over phase will last until the completion of four Lutathera administrations after which patients will undergo EOT visit (at Week 28), and proceed to the follow up phase.

After cross-over phase is complete, patients will be followed up for 3 years or until EoS, whichever occurs first (and at least 6 months after the last Lutathera dose administered during cross-over).

The time window to start cross-over treatment with Lutathera in this study is 4 years after last patient randomized.

## 3.4 Optional Re-Treatment Phase

In  the  Lutathera  arm,  patients  with  radiological  progression  based  on  RECIST  criteria  as  per central assessment have the option to enroll for post-progression re-treatment, upon signature of a new informed consent, to receive 2 to 4 additional cycles of 7.4 GBq/200 mCi of Lutathera. If RECIST progression occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis, the decision to enroll the patient in re-treatment will be based on local assessment.

Patients who have received Lutathera in Optional Treatment Extension Phase (cross-over) are not eligible for re-treatment with Lutathera.

For enrolment in the optional re-treatment phase, patients must undergo SSTR imaging and meet all requirements listed in Section 5.2.2.

Confidential

After  enrolment  into  re-treatment  phase,  patients  will  initially  receive  2  administrations  of Lutathera 7.4 GBq/200 mCi at 8-week interval. After that, the Investigator should determine if:

- The patient shows evidence of disease stabilization or response (i.e. absence of radiological progression, or assessed by clinical benefit).
- Has shown good tolerance to Lutathera re-treatment.

If the investigator considers this treatment option in the best interest of the participant and if the participant meets these criteria and agrees to continue with further treatment with Lutathera, the Investigator may administer up to 2 additional administrations of Lutathera 7.4 GBq/200 mCi at 8-week interval.  A maximum of 4 administrations of Lutathera is allowed during the re-treatment period.

All  safety  and  efficacy  assessments  in  the  re-treatment  period  will  be  performed  locally  and following the schedule in initial treatment period (expression of somatostatin receptors on all target lesions will be evaluated locally before re-treatment; there is no central 'real time' assessment of the SRI images, however the images should be submitted to the central imaging center possibly within 1 month for a second review).

During the re-treatment phase, the administration of SSAs is at investigator's discretion.

The  re-treatment  phase  will  last  until  locally  confirmed  disease  progression  or  until  EoS, whichever  occurs  first.  If  a  patient  discontinues  Lutathera  before  locally  confirmed  disease progression in re-treatment, the patient should be followed with tumor assessments as per initial CT/MRI  schedule  until  locally  confirmed  disease  progression.  After  re-treatment  phase  is complete, patients will be followed up for 3 years or until EoS, whichever occurs first (and at least 6 months after the last re-treatment dose in the study).

The  time  window  to  start  re-treatment  in  this  study  is  within  4  years  after  the  last  patient randomized.

For patients in Lutathera arm who are eligible for re-treatment beyond this window, Lutathera access for re-treatment may be granted via Post Study Drug Supply (PSDS) programs, based on local regulation (see Section 9.2.1).

## 3.5 Follow up Phase

At the end of the Treatment Phase (or the optional Treatment Extension Phase in case of crossover, or the optional Re-treatment Phase) or after discontinuation for any cause (including disease progression), all patients will continue to be followed up at least every 6 months and up to 3 years (or until EoS, whatever comes first) to continue data collection for the secondary endpoints of the study, such as long term safety and overall survival.

During  the  Follow-up  Phase,  SAEs  and  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AESI)  other  than secondary  hematological  malignancies,  related  to  the  study  treatment  and  AESI  of  secondary hematological  malignancies  irrespective  of  causality,  will  be  reported.  Anti-tumor  treatments administered after progression/discontinuation, disease status based on local CT/MRI assessment, and  OS  data  will  be  collected  every  6  months  (±  1  month)  in  both  arms  (see  schedule  of assessments in Table 8-3, and Table 8-4).

## 4 Rationale

## 4.1 Rationale for study design

This study is justified by the markedly longer PFS and significantly higher response rate in 2 nd line G1 and G2 midgut NETs demonstrated in the Lutathera arm of the Phase III NETTER-1 pivotal study (Strosberg, et al., 2017).

The  WHO  2010  classification  distinguishes  G3  NETs  (usually  ≤55%  Ki67)  from  G3  NECs (usually &gt; 55%), recognizing the NET-specific features of G3-NETs (continuum between G2 and G3 NET) (Rindi 2010, Rindi 2014).

While the Erasmus MC Phase I-II study and the NETTER-1 studies have proven the safety and efficacy of Lutathera in well differentiated Grade 1 and 2 GEP-NETs (Kwekkeboom, et al., 2008; Strosberg, et al., 2017), Grade 3 GEP-NETs still represent high unmet medical need for several reasons:

- ­ Historically, most studies have excluded G3 NET (~20% of all NETs);
- ­ The number of patients diagnosed at G3 NET stage continues to increase (Dasari, et al., 2017);
- ­ There is no universally accepted standard of care for the treatments of G3 NETs. ESMO (Oberg,  Knigge,  Kwekkeboom,  Perren,  &amp;  Group,  2012),  ENET  (Perren,  et  al.,  2017), NANETS (Kunz, et al., 2013) and NET NCCN (Kulke, et al., 2015) guidelines outline chemotherapy as primary treatment; however physicians' practice may vary (SSA and/or chemotherapy used in 1 st and 2 nd line).
- ­ Based  on  experts'  considerations  and  from  the  NORDIC  NEC  study,  a  Ki-67  cutoff between 50% and 60% has been proposed as the minimum level that should be considered to  use  platinum-based chemotherapy. Therefore, it appears reasonable to manage welldifferentiated  G  3  and  G  2  NET  patients  similarly  (Vélayoudom-Céphise,  et  al.,  2013; Heetfeld, et al., 2015). In addition, prognosis and response rate of well-differentiated G3 NET seem to be close to well differentiated G 1/2 NET with a worse overall survival (Coriat, Walter, Terris, Couvelard, &amp; Ruszniewski, 2016).
-  Efficacy  of  current  1 st line  treatments  appear  to  be  modest  with  low  ORR  with  limited evidence of PFS/OS benefit (Coriat, Walter, Terris, Couvelard, &amp; Ruszniewski, 2016). In addition, in non-pancreatic NET G-3, no chemotherapy regimen should be considered as a standard of first-line care, considering the very small amount of data available.

Therefore, in the current NETTER-2 study an advanced GEP-NET patient population of G2 with Ki67 ≥ 10% and G3 with Ki67 ≤ 55% has been included to evaluate a potential new treatment option for these patients.

In accordance with the recently finalized guidance for industry on considerations for the inclusion of adolescent patients in adult oncology clinical trials and the consensus expert opinion presented by  the  European  multi-stakeholder  platform  ACCELERATE  to  include  adolescents  in  adult oncology clinical trials when the histology and biologic behavior of the cancer under investigation is the same in, or the molecular target of the drug is relevant to, cancers in both adult and adolescent patients (FDA guidance), this study will include adolescents ≥15 years and &gt;40 kg BW. Even though the number of adolescents ≥15 years ful filling the inclusion criteria for this study is very small,  the  high  unmet  medical  need  in  this  population  is  justifying  their  enrollment.  It  is  not

expected that adolescents below the age of 15 years will present with the disease meeting the inclusion criteria for this study.

Due  to  the  radioactive  nature  of  Lutathera  and  its  method  of  infusion,  and  similarly  to  the NETTER-1 trial design, it is not possible to implement a fully double-blinded design for this study, however  a  central,  blinded,  real-time  IRC  (Independent  Review  Committee)  assessment  is implemented to ensure an independent evaluation of the tumor response according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.

Randomization will be stratified by Grade (G2 vs G3) and tumor origin (pNET vs other origin), preventing imbalance between treatment groups for known factors that influence prognosis.

For this trial a 2:1 randomization design is chosen to allow patients to have a higher chance of getting  the  treatment  which  is  anticipated  to  be  more  effective.  For  the  same  reason  and  to minimize the possible higher drop-out rate in the control arm, patients will be offered to crossover to Lutathera after centrally confirmed RECIST progression (or locally confirmed if it occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis).

Patients randomized in the Lutathera arm will also be offered optional re-treatment with additional 2-4 Lutathera doses/cycles after centrally confirmed RECIST progression (or locally confirmed if it occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis), based on the physician judgment of potential  clinical  benefit.  Overall,  therapeutic  options  in  patients  who  progress  after  PRRT treatment are limited. Based on a meta-analysis  (Strosberg et al., 2021) including patients with progressive GEP-NETs (n=560) who received re-treatment with Lutathera (one to six doses during re-treatment, majority of patients received 200 mCi per administration), the clinical benefit of retreatment was supported by a median PFS of 12.52 months (available in 414 patients), median OS of  26.78  months  from  the  start  of  re-treatment  (available  in  194  patients),  and  DCR  of  71% (available  in  347  patients).  The  safety  profile  of  Lutathera  re-treatment  was  similar  to  initial treatment. These data indicate that re-treatment with Lutathera may be considered as a treatment approach to maximize benefit without compromising on safety and with a careful assessment of clinical status of each individual patient.

## 4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment

The Lutathera arm dose/regimen of the NETTER-2 study is identical to the established regimen used  in  the  Erasmus  MC  Phase  I/II  study  (Kwekkeboom,  et  al.,  2008)  and  in  the  Phase  III NETTER-1 pivotal study (Strosberg, et al., 2017) with Lutathera cumulative dose of 29.6 GBq (800 mCi), divided into 4 administrations every 8±1 weeks, plus octreotide long-acting (30 mg) every 4 weeks.

Lutathera was approved in Europe for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic, progressive, well differentiated  (G1 and G2) GEP-NETs and in the USA for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive GEP-NETs based on the results of the pivotal Phase III NETTER-1 study and data from 1,214 patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors, including GEP-NETS, who received Lutathera at the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands.

Treatment with Lutathera resulted in markedly longer progression-free survival and a significantly higher response rate than high-dose octreotide long-acting among patients with advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors. Preliminary evidence of an overall survival benefit was seen in an interim

analysis;  confirmation  will  be  required  in  the  planned  final  analysis.  Clinically  significant myelosuppression  occurred  in  less  than  10%  of  patients  in  the  Lutathera  group.  The  PFSprolongation was similar in the two Ki67 strata (≤2% and 3 -20%) suggesting a potential benefit for patients with advanced G2 and 3 GEP-NET to be included in the NETTER-2 study.

Optional re-treatment with additional doses of Lutathera will be offered to patients treated in the Lutathera arm upon disease progression, based on recent published data on re-treatment in GEPNETs  (Strosberg  et  al.,  2021).  The  candidate  patients  for  re-treatment  with  Lutathera  in  this protocol, are patients with centrally documented tumor progression in Lutathera arm, who have completed the 4 doses/cycles  of  Lutathera  during  the  treatment  phase,  had  CR/PR/SD  as  best response for at least 6 months (-2 weeks window is allowed) after the 4 th Lutathera dose, and had tolerated the treatment (according to criteria defined in Section 5.2.2). Patients will be offered to receive initially two Lutathera doses in re-treatment period (Section 4.3). Based on the physician judgment of clinical benefit derived from the first 2 doses, patients may receive up to 2 additional doses of Lutathera (criteria for additional doses are listed in Section 4.3). A maximum of 4 doses of Lutathera is allowed during the re-treatment period. The dose level assessed in the re-treatment portion of this study will be the same as the approved level of 7.4 GBq per cycle, based on the published meta-analysis data that showed that majority of patients received this dose (Strosberg et al., 2021).

## 4.3 Rationale for choice of control drug

The control arm dose/regimen of the NETTER-2 study is identical to the dose/regimen used in the NETTER-1 study (octreotide long-acting (60 mg) every 4 weeks).

The clinical experience with octreotide is extensive, but there is currently a lack of data in the use of somatostatin analogues in G3 GEP-NET patients.

Patients in the comparator arm of the present NETTER-2 study will receive 60 mg octreotide longacting  at  4-weeks  intervals.  The  dose  is  supported  by  findings  of  Broder  et  al.  (2015),  who performed  a  systematic  review  of  the  literature  to  analyze  the  anti-proliferative  benefit  of somatostatin analogs. They confirmed that doses of &gt;30 mg octreotide long-acting are commonly used by clinical experts for symptom and tumor progression control in NET patients. This dose (60 mg) was also tested in comparator arm of the pivotal Phase III NETTER-1 study (Strosberg, et al., 2017). In current clinical practice, it is likely that even a higher percentage of patients receive &gt;30 mg of Octreotide LAR (Anthony &amp; Vinik, 2011; Joseph, et al., 2010; Wolin, 2012; Broder, Beenhouwer, Strosberg, Neary, &amp; Cherepanov, 2015). The 4-week interval injections of 60 mg octreotide long-acting is a higher dose than the 4-week interval injections with 20 mg or 30 mg, which  is  presently  the  registered  dose  for  Sandostatin ®   LAR  Depot.  With  this  treatment,  the majority  of  symptomatic  patients  show  an  improvement  in  QoL,  and  most  patients  obtain temporary stable disease based on CT scans (Faiss, et al., 1999; Faiss, et al., 2003; Rinke, et al., 2009; Ludlam &amp; Anthony, 2011; Anthony &amp; Vinik, 2011; Wolin, 2012; Broder, Beenhouwer, Strosberg, Neary, &amp; Cherepanov, 2015).

Furthermore, according to the Phase III NETTER-1 study results, patients with metastatic midgut tumors progressive after standard dose (30 mg) SSAs treated in the control arm of the study with high  dose  (60  mg)  octreotide  long-acting  had  a  median  time  free  from  relapse  of  8.4  months

Confidential

(Strosberg, et al., 2017) without notable side effects, confirming that this regimen has anti-tumor benefit and is well tolerated.

In a clinical study published by Astruc et al. (Astruc, et al., 2005), in which healthy subjects were treated with 20 mg and 60 mg of Octreotide LAR, the PK data showed that the plasma exposure was dose-proportional and the treatment was well tolerated at both doses.

Available pharmacokinetic (PK) data in children at 40 mg Octreotide LAR show that the plasma exposure, corrected for the dose, is similar in adults and young patients. Moreover, Octreotide LAR was well tolerated in children at 40 mg. It should be noted that the same dose was given to &lt;12 and &gt;12 years old patients.

Therefore, in accordance with available PK data and in line with FDA guidance for inclusion of adolescents  in  the  adult  oncology  trials  and  the  consensus  expert  opinion  presented  by  the European  multi-stakeholder  platform  ACCELERATE  it  is  considered  acceptable  to  include adolescents in the NETTER-2 study at the same fixed dose administered in adults, considering a population ≥ 15 y and &gt; 40 kg.

Based on currently available data of high dose somatostatin analogues, the use as a comparator in this study, at 60 mg dosage, is justified considering the high unmet medical need in a population not candidate for chemo or targeted therapy in the investigator opinion.

## 4.4 Purpose and timing of interim analyses

At the time of the PFS primary analysis, an estimate of overall survival will be calculated in terms of hazard ratio (point estimate) and 95% confidence interval.

## 4.5 Risks and benefits

Neuroendocrine  tumors  (NETs)  represent  a  small  proportion  of  cancers  but  are  increasing  in incidence  due  to  incidental  diagnosis.  Prognosis  for  grade  1  and  localized  NETs  has  steadily improved, however patients with distant and/or grade 3 NETs continue to fare poorly (Sackstein, O'Neil, Neugut, Chabot, &amp; Fojo, 2018).

Patient  management  poses  a  significant  challenge  because  of  the  heterogeneous  clinical presentations and varying degrees of aggressiveness.

Randomization will be stratified by tumor origin (pNET vs other origin) and Grade (G2 vs G3), preventing imbalance between treatment groups for known factors that influence prognosis.

The population of G2 and G3 GEP-NET patients included in the NETTER-2 study is not candidate for chemo or targeted therapy in the investigator opinion. G3 GEPNET patients with Ki67 ≤ 55 are a category of G3 neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) where tumors retain their well-differentiated characteristics, continue to express somatostatin receptors, but have a higher proliferation rate then the majority of GEP-NETs (Rindi, et al., 2018). Aggressive G2 GEP-NETs patients with Ki67 range 10% to 20% share with G3 GEP-NETs the greater likelihood of poor prognosis, and limited treatment options. Despite advances in medical therapy for these tumors, there is still a high unmet medical need to control tumor growth, especially for G3 GEP-NETs (~10-20% of all NETs), which historically have been excluded from most studies (Sorbye, et al., 2019; Coriat, Walter, Terris, Couvelard, &amp; Ruszniewski, 2016; Dasari, et al., 2017).

The most important risk mitigating factor for GEP-NET patients who are considered for treatment with Lutathera, is the ability to use receptor scintigraphy imaging to select those patients who are

most likely to respond to PRRT, and to exclude patients who would not benefit from the treatment because their tumors do not express high enough levels of the somatostatin receptor.

Based on the results achieved in other PRRT studies using 177 Lu-dotatate (Strosberg 2017; 2018 Brabander 2016), the major expected benefits to patients treated with Lutathera include the high probability of extending progression free survival, increasing overall survival and increasing time to deterioration of quality of life.

For this trial a 2:1 randomization design is chosen to allow patients to have a higher chance of getting  the  treatment  which  is  anticipated  to  be  more  effective.  For  the  same  reason  and  to minimize the possible higher drop-out rate in the control arm, patients will be offered to crossover to Lutathera after centrally confirmed RECIST progression (or locally confirmed if it occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis).

The highest risks arising from treatment with Lutathera are radiation toxicities affecting either bone marrow or kidney function (Bergsma, et al., 2016a; Bergsma, et al., 2016b).

Kidney function risks are largely eliminated by the co-infusion of 2.5% Lys-Arg solutions during administration of Lutathera, which reduces the radiation dose to the kidney by approximately 45% (Rolleman, Valkema, Jong, Kooij, &amp; Krenning, 2003). In the NETTER-1 trial no evidence of renal toxicities occurred within the period of observation (Strosberg, et al., 2017).

Bone marrow toxicity may occur in two forms: 1) acute toxicity that occurs after administration of  Lutathera,  during  the  treatment  period;  and  2)  delayed  toxicity  that  occurs  in  1.5  to  2%  of patients.  The  potential  observed  effects  of  short-term  bone  marrow  toxicity  are  anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia which are usually mild and transient. In the NETTER-1 trial, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia occurred in 1%, 2%, and 9% of patients  (Strosberg,  et  al.,  2017).  Where  hematological  toxicity  occurs,  a  trend  towards stabilization  followed  by  improvement  in  patients  with  longer  follow-up  is  observed.  It  is important to note that the lymphocyte toxicity observed following PRRT is not a major concern regarding risk of infections, since only B lymphocytes are affected, a subtype which is not directly involved in infection defense (Sierra, et al., 2009).

There is evidence that males may be at risk of decreased spermatogenesis following PRRT with 177 Lu-dotatate. In a study by (Teunissen, et al., 2009), a significant decrease of mean serum inhibin B  levels  was  observed  in  male  patients  (N=35)  treated  with 177 Lu-dotatate.  It  has  been demonstrated that serum inhibin B levels are positively correlated with spermatogenic status and sperm count (Pierik, Vreeburg, Stijnen, De Jong, &amp; Weber, 1998). The study (Teunissen, et al., 2009) also found recovery to almost pretreatment levels after 24 months. The potential long-term genetic damage to spermatogenic cells has not been studied.

Women and men should not procreate until six months after the end of their last treatment with Lutathera. However, due to additional exposure from CT scans taken during the study, women in both arms should also not procreate during the whole treatment period of the study. Women of child bearing potential and sexually active males must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study, and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements outlined in the exclusion criteria and in Appendix 1. If there is any question that the subject will not reliably comply, they should not be entered or continue in the study.

Confidential

Based  on  the  FDA  guidance  for  inclusion  of  adolescents  in  the  adult  oncology  trials  and  the consensus expert opinion presented by the European multi-stakeholder platform ACCELERATE it is recommended that adolescents can receive the same dose administered in adults if there is no relevant  effect  of  body  size  on  pharmacokinetics,  which  is  the  case  for  both,  Lutathera  and octreotide long-acting. Based on the similar clinical presentation of the disease under evaluation in adolescents, the following inclusion criteria have been chosen for this study: ≥15 years old and &gt;40 kg BW (aligned with the BW recommendation from the FDA guidance).

With  regards  to  re-treatment  with  Lutathera,  the  results  of  a  meta-analysis  of  patients  with progressive  GEP-NETs  who  received  re-treatment  with  peptide  receptor  radionuclide  therapy (PRRT), are supportive of administration of additional Lutathera doses after progression on initial treatment.  It  was  shown  that  the  safety  profile  of  Lutathera  re-treatment  was  similar  to  initial treatment  (Strosberg  et  al.,  2021).  In  this  meta-analysis,  additional  treatment  courses  with Lutathera  ranged  from  one  to  six  doses,  and  majority  of  patients  received  200  mCi  per administration. Hematologic grade 3/4 AEs were reported in 9% of patients who received PRRT re-treatment. Notably, AML and MDS occurred in &lt;1% of patients who received re-treatment with Lutathera, comparable to the incidence observed with initial PRRT. Re-treatment with Lutathera provided encouraging median PFS. This data indicates that re-treatment with Lutathera can be offered  to  patients  to  maximize  benefit  without  compromising  on  safety  and  with  a  careful assessment of clinical status of each individual patient.

Dose modifying toxicity rules have been implemented in this study taking into account the higher GEP-NET  severity  in  the  NETTER-2  study  compared  to  the  approved  indication.  The administration of a full Lutathera dose (200 mCi/7.4 GBq) if a toxicity is resolved will maximize the potential treatment effects and maintain a positive benefit/risk ratio.

To  ensure  the  safety  of  the  subjects  in  this  trial,  appropriate  eligibility  criteria  and  study procedures,  as  well  as  close  clinical  monitoring,  following  dose  modifying  toxicity  rules,  and Steering Committee study oversight are included in this protocol.

In  light  of  all  the  above-mentioned  elements,  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Lutathera  within  the overall clinical context defined in the clinical trial appears to weight in favor of patient's benefit.

## 4.6 Rationale for public health emergency mitigation procedures

In  the  event  of  a  public  health  emergency  as  declared  by  local  or  regional  authorities  (i.e. pandemic,  epidemic  or  natural  disaster),  mitigation  procedures  may  be  required  to  ensure participant  safety  and  trial  integrity  and  are  listed  in  relevant  sections  of  the  study  protocol. Notification  of  the  public  health  emergency  should  be  discussed  with  Sponsor  prior  to implementation  of  mitigation  procedures  and  permitted/approved  by  local  or  regional  health authorities and ethics committees as appropriate.

## 5 Population

In this study, safety and efficacy of treatment with Lutathera plus octreotide long-acting (30 mg) versus  high  dose  octreotide  longacting  (60  mg)  is  evaluated  in  patients  ≥15  years  old  with somatostatin receptor positive, well differentiated G2 (Ki67 index ≥10%) and G3 (Ki67 ≤ 55%) advanced GEP-NETs. Patients with documented RECIST progression to previous treatments for the current GEP-NET at any time prior to randomization are not eligible to participate in this study.

## 5.1 Inclusion criteria

Subjects eligible for inclusion in this study must meet all of the following criteria:

1. Presence  of  metastasized  or  locally  advanced,  inoperable  (curative  intent)  histologically proven, well differentiated Grade 2 or Grade 3 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine (GEPNET) tumor diagnosed within 6 months prior to screening.
2. Ki67 index ≥10 and ≤ 55%.

## 5.2.1 Eligibility Criteria for Optional Treatment Extension Phase (cross-over)

Any centrally confirmed RECIST progressive patient has the option to enroll for post-progression cross-over and receive maximum 4 cycles of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 cycles; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq / 800mCi) plus octreotide long-acting (30 mg every 8 weeks), provided that the following criteria are met:

- ­ Patients have provided a signed informed consent form to participate in the study treatment extension phase, obtained prior to the start of any related procedures.
- ­ Expression of somatostatin receptors on all target lesions (based on post-progression new baseline assessment) documented by CT/MRI scans (Note: Cross-over Eligibility CT/MRI scan doesn't need to be repeated if performed within the previous 12 weeks), assessed by any of the following somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) modalities within 3 months prior to  Lutathera treatment:  [68Ga]-DOTA-TOC (e.g. Somakit-TOC ® )  PET/CT imaging (or MRI when applicable based on target lesions), [68Ga]-DOTA-TATE PET/CT (or MRI when  applicable  based  on  target  lesions)  imaging  (e.g.  NETSPOT ® ),  Somatostatin Receptor scintigraphy (SRS) with [111In]-pentetreotide (Octreoscan ®  SPECT/CT), SRS with [99mTc]-Tektrotyd, [64Cu]-DOTA-TATE PET/CT imaging (or MRI when applicable based on target lesions).
- ­ All protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria are met (see Sections 5.1 and 5.2).
- ­ The time window to start cross-over is 4 years after last patient randomized.
- ­ Note: Prior each Lutathera administration a 6-week washout period from last octreotide long-acting administration has to be applied.

If RECIST progression occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis, the decision to enroll the patient in cross-over will be based on local assessment.

Images (Cross-over Eligibility SRI and CT or MRI scan) will be also submitted to the central imaging center for a second review: there is no central 'real time' assessment of the Cross-Over Eligibility SRI uptake; however, the images should be submitted to the central imaging center possibly within 1 month. Images submission is not required for screening failure patients.

## 5.2.2 Eligibility Criteria for Optional Re-Treatment Phase

In the Lutathera arm, patients with radiological progression based on RECIST criteria in central assessment, have the option to enroll for post-progression re-treatment, upon signature of a new informed consent, to receive 2 to 4 additional cycles of 7.4 GBq/200 mCi of Lutathera.

For enrolment in the optional re-treatment phase, patients must meet all following requirements:

- ­ Randomized  to  Lutathera  arm,  received  4  doses  of  Lutathera  in  initial  treatment  and experienced  either  disease  stabilization  (SD)  or  objective  response  (PR/CR)  (centrally confirmed) for at least 6 months after the 4 th Lutathera dose. If a patient's response has changed from PR/CR to SD within 6 months after the 4 th Lutathera dose, the patient is still eligible for re-treatment, provided there is no documented progression within 6 months. A window of -2 weeks is allowed for the confirmation of 6 months of SD/PR/CR response.
- ­ Lutathera was overall well tolerated; no recorded SAEs related to Lutathera that were not resolved before the next Lutathera dose and led to treatment interruption.
- ­ After the SD/PR/CR response, experienced radiological RECIST progression (centrally confirmed).  If  RECIST  progression  occurs  after  Week  72  post  the  primary  end  point analysis, the decision to enroll the patient in re-treatment will be based on local assessment.
- ­ Patient  did  not  receive  any  other  systemic  treatment  for  GEP-NET  after  progression (somatostatin analogues are allowed).

Confidential

- ­ Investigator's agreement that re-treatment is in the best interest for the patient
- ­ Patients have provided a signed informed consent form to participate in the re-treatment phase, obtained prior to the start of any related procedures.
- ­ Time window to start re-treatment: 4 years after last patient randomized (see Section 9.2).
- ­ Expression of somatostatin receptors on all target lesions (based on post-progression new baseline  assessment)  documented  by  CT/MRI  scans  (Note:  Re-treatment  Eligibility CT/MRI scan doesn't need to be repeated if performed within the previous 12 weeks), assessed by any of the following somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) modalities within 3 months  prior to Lutathera re-treatment: [68Ga]-DOTA-TOC  (e.g.  Somakit-TOC ® ) PET/CT imaging (or MRI when applicable based on target lesions), [68Ga]-DOTA-TATE PET/CT (or MRI when applicable based on target lesions) imaging (e.g. NETSPOT ® ), Somatostatin Receptor scintigraphy (SRS)  with [111In]-pentetreotide  (Octreoscan ® SPECT/CT), SRS with [99mTc]-Tektrotyd, [64Cu]-DOTA-TATE PET/CT imaging (or MRI when applicable based on target lesions).

Images (Re-treatment Eligibility SRI and CT or MRI scan) will be also submitted to the central imaging  center  for  a  second  review:  there  is  no  central  'real  time'  assessment  of  the  Retreatment  Eligibility  SRI  uptake,  however  the  images  should  be  submitted  to  the  central imaging  center  possibly  within  1  month.  Images  submission  is  not  required  for  screening failure patients.

## 6 Treatment

## 6.1.1.1 Lutathera arm

## 6.1.1.1.1 Investigational Drug Product: Lutathera (177Lu-Dotatate)

Lutathera is a sterile   radiopharmaceutical as a ready-to-use   solution for  infusion containing I77Lu-DOTA'-Tyr-Octreotate as Substance with a volumetric activity of 370 MBq/mL at reference date and time (calibration time (tc)) supplied Drug

On the of Lutathera   treatment; an intravenous bolus of anti-emetic is given. For renal protection; a sterile amino acids solution is infused 30 minutes before the start of Lutathera; and continues for a total of 4 h. See futher details in Section 6.6. day

Lutathera is a radiopharmaceutical solution for infusion as a ready-to-use product. The only Quality Control (QC) tests that must be performed at the clinical site are; 1) confirm correct product certificate; 2) determine total radioactivity; 3) confirm visual appearance. Since Lutathera is manufactured in centralized GMP facilities; the majority of required QC tests are performed before   product   shipment. A batch release certificate of   the product will be sent to the investigational centres. This batch release certificate is provided by the Qualified Person (QP) of the manufacturing site to ensure that the product is suitable for administration and that it meets the specifications indicated in the product leaflet. supplied

Manufacturing site prepares single doses calibrated within the range of 7.4 4 10 % (200 mCi) between t0+6h and t0+52h after the end of production:. Certificate of release reports both the exact activity provided and the time when this activity is reached. The total amount of radioactivity per single dose vial is 7,400 at the date and time of infusion. Given the fixed volumetric activity of 370 MBq/ml at the date and time of calibration; the volume of the solution is adjusted between 20.5 ml and 25.0 ml in order to provide the required amount of radioactivity at the date and time of infusion.

*The recommended pH range of the 2.5% Lys-Arg sterile solution is

5.0-7.0 with an osmolarity of 420-480 mOsm/kg.

In  addition  to  the  antiemetic  premedication  (see  Section  6.6),  in  case  of  persistent  nausea  or vomiting during the administration of amino acids, Investigators are advised to use antiemetics which  are  commonly  prescribed  in  their  institutions  for  treatment  of  nausea  induced  by chemotherapeutic  drugs.  Among  such  antiemetics,  the  use  of  Aprepitant  (Emend ® )  should  be considered. Haloperidol (Haldol ® ) could also be considered as an adjunct treatment (either i.v. or oral) in case the advised antiemetic regimens are not successful and patients continue to vomit as well as Lorazepam (Ativan ® ).

In case where the treatments previously provided for nausea and vomiting are insufficient, a single dose of corticosteroids can be used, as long as it is not given before initiating or within one hour after the end of Lutathera infusion (please see Section 6.2.3).

## 6.1.1.1.3 Concomitant Treatment: 30 mg octreotide long-acting (Sandostatin ®  LAR Depot)

Sandostatin ®  LAR Depot (octreotide long-acting) is a pharmaceutical that is available in a singleuse kit containing a 6-mL vial of 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg strength for intramuscular injection, a syringe containing 2.5 mL of diluent, two sterile 1½' 19 gauge needles, and two alcohol wipes. For prolonged storage, Sandostatin ®   LAR  Depot  should  be  stored  at  refrigerated  temperatures between 2°C and 8°C (36°F-46°F) and protected from light until the time of use. An instruction booklet for the preparation of drug suspension for injection is also included with each kit.

Octreotide long-acting 30 mg (Sandostatin ®  LAR Depot) is preferably administered the day after each administration of Lutathera and no earlier than 4 hours after completion of the Lutathera infusion.  Due  to  the  6-weeks  washout  period  before  each  Lutathera  injection,  no  additional octreotide  long-acting  administrations  are  recommended  between  Lutathera  treatments.  Once Lutathera treatment completed, and also in case the Lutathera infusions have been suspended (e.g due to Dose Modifying Toxicity), patients will continue the 4-week interval administrations of 30 mg  octreotide  long-acting  until  the  completion  of  the  Treatment  Phase  (see  Treatment  Phase definition in Section 3).

## 6.1.1.2 Control arm

## 6.1.1.2.1 60 mg octreotide long-acting (Sandostatin ®  LAR Depot)

Sandostatin ®  LAR Depot (octreotide long-acting) is a pharmaceutical that is available in singleuse kits containing a 6-mL vial of 10 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg strength for intramuscular injection, a

Protocol No. CAAA601A22301

syringe containing 2.5 mL of diluent, two sterile 1½' 19 gauge needles, and two alcohol wipes. For prolonged storage, Sandostatin ®   LAR  Depot  should  be  stored  at  refrigerated  temperatures between 2°C and 8°C (36°F-46°F) and protected from light until the time of use. An instruction booklet for the preparation of drug suspension for injection is also included with each kit.

In  the  control  arm,  patients  will  receive  administrations  of  octreotide  long-acting  60  mg (Sandostatin ®  LAR Depot) at 4-week intervals (+/- 3 days) until the completion of the Treatment Phase (see Treatment Phase definition in Section 3), according to the schedule in Table 8-4 (i.e., two injections of Sandostatin ®  LAR 30 mg per treatment), unless the patient progresses or dies.

Patients who were SSA-naïve before enrolment in the study, should receive first planned dose at 30mg and the second (and subsequent) planned dose(s) at 60mg (full dose).

## 6.2 Other treatment(s)

## 6.2.1 Rescue medication

## 6.2.1.1 Short-acting Octreotide

Subcutaneous, short-acting octreotide injections may be indicated for control of symptoms (i.e. diarrhoea  and  flushing)  in  patients  in  both  study  arms,  in  accordance  with  the  manufacturer's prescribing information. Short-acting octreotide for symptom control is administered by the patient (at home) at investigator's discretion.

## 6.2.2 Other anti-cancer treatments

The  patient  may  not  receive  any  other  systemic  therapy  for  the  treatment  of  GEP-NET (chemotherapeutic, biologic, or any investigational agent) other than Lutathera and/or short-acting octreotide and/or octreotide long-acting during the study Treatment Phase. Localized therapy such as surgery or external beam irradiation may be performed on additional site(s), provided that it does not affect treatment response assessment; no surgeries are allowed within 12 weeks prior to Lutathera administration.

The last administration of long-acting SSA before the start of the study treatment is allowed during the screening period, before randomization, but should be carefully planned to allow a 6 weeks washout period prior to the administration of Lutathera.

New anti-cancer treatments administered after progression or during the Follow up Phase must be registered in the eCRF.

## 6.2.3 Prohibited medication

Somatostatin and its analogues competitively bind to somatostatin receptors. Therefore, administration of long-acting somatostatin analogues should be avoided within 6 weeks prior to the administration of Lutathera. If necessary, patients may be treated with short acting somatostatin analogues during the 6 weeks until 24 hours preceding Lutathera administration.

There  is  some  evidence  that  corticosteroids  can  induce  down-regulation  of  SST2  receptors. Therefore, as a matter of caution, repeated administration of high-doses of glucocorticosteroids should  be  avoided  during  Lutathera  treatment.  Patients  with  a  history  of  chronic  use  of glucocorticosteroids should be carefully evaluated for sufficient somatostatin receptor expression. It is not known if there is any interaction between glucocorticosteroids used intermittently for the

prevention of nausea and vomiting during Lutathera administration. Therefore, glucocorticosteroids should be avoided as preventive anti-emetic treatment. In the case where the treatments  previously  provided  for  nausea  and  vomiting  are  insufficient,  a  single  dose  of corticosteroids can be used, as long as it is not given before initiating or within one hour after the end of Lutathera infusion.

The absence of inhibition or significant induction of the human CYP450 enzymes, the absence of specific  interaction  with  P-glycoprotein  (efflux  transporter)  as  well  as  OAT1,  OAT3,  OCT1, OCT2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BCRP transporters in pre-clinical studies suggest that Lutathera has  a  low  probability  of  causing  clinically  relevant  metabolism-  or  transporter-mediated interactions.

The  following  cautions  regarding  possible  Octreotide  Drug-Drug-Interactions  (DDI)  must  be observed (according to the Octreotide label):

- -Dose adjustment of medicinal products such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or agents  to  control  fluid  and  electrolyte  balance  may  be  necessary  when  administered concomitantly.
- -Dose  adjustments  of  insulin  and  antidiabetic  medicinal  products  may  be  required  when administered concomitantly.
- -Octreotide has been found to reduce the intestinal absorption of ciclosporin and to delay that of cimetidine.
- -Concomitant administration of octreotide and bromocriptine increases the bioavailability of bromocriptine.
- -Drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index should be used with caution (e.g. quinidine, terfenadine).
- -Octreotide may alter absorption of dietary fats in some patients.
- -Depressed vitamin B12 levels and abnormal Schilling's tests have been observed in some patients  receiving  octreotide  therapy.  Monitoring  of  vitamin  B12  levels  is  recommended during therapy with Octreotide LAR in patients.

## 6.2.4 SARS-CoV-2 vaccination

Patients  are  allowed  to  receive  approved  SARS-CoV-2  vaccines  (inactivated,  viral-vector-,  or mRNA based  Sars-CoV-2  vaccines  approved  by  the  Health  Authorities  in  the  country).  The decision for vaccination should be done on a case-by-case basis and at the discretion of the treating physician, with patient consent, and in alignment with institutional guidelines, if available.

Investigators are expected to evaluate potential risks/benefits in the context of individual patient characteristics, and make an individualized decision for vaccination. Investigators should refer to the prescribing information for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine planned to be used and/or follow local Health Authorities or institutional guidelines, if available.

It is encouraged to complete the vaccination for COVID-19 (i.e. receive the two vaccine doses if necessary) prior to initiation of study treatment. If the vaccination should occur while a patient is on-treatment, vaccine may be administered per routine clinical practice.

Confidential

Patients should be instructed to contact their GP and/or the study site in case of side effects after vaccination.

Vaccine must be reported as a prior/concomitant medication according to the protocol guidelines. Any AEs after vaccination must be monitored and reported in eCRF.

## 6.3 Subject numbering, treatment assignment, randomization

## 6.3.1 Subject numbering

For all patients who have signed the ICF, a screening number will be assigned in chronological order starting with the lowest number available on site. Patients will be identified by a unique patient identification number (Patient ID No.) composed of the center number and the screening number.

## 6.3.2 Treatment assignment, randomization

After the screening period, eligible patients will be randomly assigned (ratio 2:1) to one of the two study  groups  for  treatment  with  Lutathera  plus  octreotide  long-acting  (30  mg)  or  high  dose octreotide  long-acting (60  mg).  The  randomization  system will  assign a  unique  randomization number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm. Randomization will be stratified by tumor Grade (G2 vs G3) and tumor origin (pNET vs other origin) according to a stratified permuted block scheme.

The details of the procedure to obtain the patient randomization number will be described in the Investigator's Manual.

## 6.4 Treatment blinding

Due  to  the  radioactive  nature  of  Lutathera  and  its  method  of  infusion,  it  is  not  possible  to implement a blinded design for this study.

## 6.5 Dose compliance, modification and discontinuation

## 6.5.1 Dose compliance

For each single-dose of Lutathera a deviation of ±10% from the scheduled dose is allowed.

## 6.5.2 Dose modification

Modifying Toxicities (DMT) will apply in both arms as discussed in Sections 6.5.2.1 and 6.5.2.2. Patients whose treatment is interrupted or permanently discontinued due to toxicities that fulfil the criteria for a DMT, must be followed up at regular intervals (at least once a week), until resolution or stabilization of the event(s), whichever comes first.

Appropriate clinical experts such as cardiologists, endocrinologists, hepatologists, nephrologists etc. should be consulted as deemed necessary.

Protocol No. CAAA601A22301

## 6.5.2.1 Dose modifying toxicities (DMTs) for Lutathera

For  patients  who  do  not  tolerate  the  protocol-specified  dosing  schedule,  dose  adjustments  are permitted to allow the patient to continue the study treatment.

The criteria for dose modifications of Lutathera for toxicities are outlined in Table 6-4.

If  a  patient  requires  a  dose  delay  of  &gt;  16  consecutive  weeks of Lutathera from the day of the previous dose, then the patient should be discontinued from the study treatment. In exceptional situations, if the patient is clearly benefiting from the study treatment (i.e. stable disease, partial response, complete response), and in the opinion of the investigator no safety concerns are present, after discussion with AAA Medical Monitor, the patient may remain on the study treatment.

For each patient, a maximum of one dose reduction will be allowed after which the patient will be discontinued from the study.

These dose changes must be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).

## In addition,

- permanently discontinue  treatment  with  Lutathera  if  hypersensitivity  due  to  the  active substance or any of excipients of Lutathera is observed;
- Temporarily discontinue treatment with Lutathera, until resolution or stabilisation before treatment can be resumed.
- -Occurrence of an intercurrent disease (e.g. urinary tract infection);
- -Major surgery: wait 12 weeks after the date of surgery, then restart the treatment with Lutathera.

After resolution of a DMT, a patient may receive subsequent planned treatment(s) at the full dose (if resolved within 9 weeks after the previous dose), or at 50% of the standard treatment dose (if resolved within 9 - 16 weeks after the previous dose), if this is felt to be safe for the patient, or the risk-benefit assessment is favourable. If the same DMT reoccurs after treatment with the reduced Lutathera dose, the patient will remain in the study and continue the scheduled clinical / tumor assessments until tumor progression, but no further Lutathera treatment will be given. Octreotide long-acting 30 mg will be continued at monthly intervals. If the DMT event does not reoccur, the next  treatment  is  at  full  dose,  if  it  is  considered  to  be  safe  for  the  patient,  or  the  risk-benefit assessment is favourable.

If a patient experiences a DMT during Lutathera therapy, subsequent treatments with Lutathera are  permissible,  provided  the  DMT  resolves  within  16  weeks  following  the  non-tolerated administration. In any case, the patient will continue the administration of 30 mg octreotide longacting.

Confidential

Protocol No. CAAA601A22301

Lutathera overdose, has a very low probability of occurring since it will be supplied as a single dose "ready to use product" in order to avoid any manipulation outside the production facilities. In addition, the infusion system methods do not allow the concurrent use of two separate Lutathera solution  vials  (see  pharmacy  manual).  No  doubling  of  the  administered  radioactivity  is  ever allowed  either  in  absolute  amount  or  by  shortening  the  time  intervals  between  treatments. Treatments (amount of radioactivity and time of administration) will be monitored during the study and any unallowed treatment modification will be considered a major protocol violation.

## 6.5.2.2 Dose modifying toxicities (DMTs) for Octreotide LAR

## Control arm (Octreotide LAR 60 mg)

In the treatment arm with octreotide long-acting, a dose adjustment will be applied in case of Grade 3  or  4  toxicity,  especially  in  presence  of  severe  abdominal  symptoms,  and  hypoglycaemia/ hyperglycemia possibly related to octreotide long-acting. The dose adjustment will also be applied if  such  adverse  events  are  observed  which  are  unlikely  related  to  the  study  drug,  but  to  other possible  or  concomitant  causes,  and  the  full  administration  of  octreotide  long-acting  would represent a safety risk for the patient.

If a patient experiences a DMT during octreotide long-acting treatment, the subsequent treatment dose  will  be  reduced  from  60  mg  to  the  previous  well-tolerated  dose  (or  even  temporarily suspended) and then at the next treatment, the dose will be increased to the initial 60 mg dose of octreotide long-acting, if this is felt to be safe for the patient, or the risk-benefit assessment is favorable.

In any case (also in case of octreotide long-acting treatment dose suspension), the patient remains in  the  study  and  continues the scheduled clinical / tumor assessments until tumor progression, unless the patient's withdrawal becomes inevitable (Section 9 - Study discontinuation).

## Lutathera arm (Octreotide LAR 30 mg)

All DMT recommendations in the control arm (Octreotide LAR 60 mg) are also applicable to the Lutathera arm, where Octreotide LAR is administered at the standard approved dosage (30 mg). Overall, the exact dose reduction levels, duration of suspension and criteria for re-increase and continuation of dose in the control arm will be defined by the treating physician based on clinical judgment and product leaflet.

Confidential

## 6.5.3 Dose discontinuation

The discontinuation of either study treatments in both arms (Lutathera or octreotide long-acting) is not a reason for patient's withdrawal either from the clinical/tumor assessments until tumor progression, or for early study termination (reasons for the patient's withdrawal are discussed in Section  9  -  Study  discontinuation).  However,  in  case  of  a  patient's  withdrawal  from  the clinical/tumor  assessments  or  early  study  termination  (based  on  either  the  patient's  or  the Investigator's decision), patients will undergo all exams scheduled for the End of Treatment (EOT) visit (Table 8-3, Table 8-4).

If the treatment discontinuation occurs because of laboratory abnormality, or any evidence of toxicity, the Investigator will collect additional specimens for repeat or additional analyses, at intervals appropriate to the abnormality. The patient will be closely followed until sufficient information  is  obtained  to  determine  the  cause  or  the  value  regresses.  Appropriate  remedial measures should be taken and the response recorded in the eCRF.

## 6.6 Preparation and dispensation of Lutathera

There is no need for the patients to fast before treatment.

Treatment with Lutathera will consist of a cumulative amount of radioactivity of 29.6 GBq (800 mCi) with the dosing divided among 4 administrations of Lutathera at 8±1-week intervals or up to 16 weeks to accommodate resolving acute toxicity (see Section 6.5.2.1). Each dose is infused over 30 minutes.

In addition to treatment with Lutathera, patients will receive 30 mg octreotide long-acting until the completion of the Treatment Phase (see Treatment Phase definition in Section 3).

## Before each Lutathera treatment:

1. Unless clinically impossible, octreotide long-acting must not be administered within 6 weeks of the next treatment of Lutathera. In other words, between 2 Lutathera injections performed at  regular  interval  (8  weeks)  only  one  30mg  octreotide  long-acting  injection  can  be administered (possibly one day after Lutathera administration or at least after 4 hours after the end of Lutathera infusion). While not treated with octreotide long-acting, the patient must be treated with an equivalent dosing of short acting octreotide s.c. "Clinically impossible" means that the actual clinical condition of the patient would contraindicate the suspension of treatment  because  of  an  otherwise  untreatable  carcinoid  syndrome.  After  enrollment, octreotide long-acting injections should be planned in order to allow for suitable washout time before first Lutathera treatment. If the time interval between treatments with Lutathera (see  Section  6.5.2.1)  is  prolonged  for  any  reason,  octreotide  long-acting  administration continues every 4 weeks, however it should not be administered within 6 weeks of the next Lutathera treatment.
2. Short-acting octreotide is not allowed during the 24 h before the Lutathera treatment date, unless the actual patient clinical conditions would contraindicate the treatment suspension due to otherwise untreatable carcinoid syndrome symptoms. Short-acting octreotide can only

Confidential be continued if the tumor uptake on SRI imaging during continued somatostatin analogue medication is greater than liver uptake (see Exclusion criteria).

3. Treatment with 30 mg octreotide long-acting can be resumed after the administration of Lutathera. Specifically, the recommended period before resuming octreotide long-acting (or short acting octreotide s.c.) is one day, however the minimum interval to receive octreotide long-acting (or short acting octreotide s.c.) after Lutathera is 4 hours, unless contraindicated as noted above.

The total amount of administered radioactivity is determined by measuring the radioactivity in the Lutathera vial before and after administration (the procedure is provided in Appendix 8).

The scheme for supportive treatment with 30 mg octreotide long-acting is presented in Figure 6-1.

- 3 If Lutathera treatment is delayed due to DMT, octreotide long-acting may be continued at 4-week intervals, but  should  not  be  administered  within  6  weeks  before  next  Lutathera  treatment;  patient  should  use octreotide s.c. during the washout period
- 4 After patients receive all 4 Lutathera administrations at 8±1 week intervals, or Lutathera treatment stopped because of toxicity, patients continue to receive 30 mg octreotide long-acting (1 im injection every 4 weeks) until end of Treatment Phase, unless progression occurs.

On the day of Lutathera treatment, and before the infusion with 2.5% Lys-Arg solution is started, an  intravenous  bolus  of  anti-emetic  is  given  (suggested  options:  Granisetron  (3  mg),  or Ondansetron (8 mg), or Tropisetron (5 mg)). Prednisone must be avoided as preventive antiemetic treatment because of potential somatostatin receptor down-regulation.

Confidential

Hyperkaleamia must  be  corrected  prior  to  2.5%  Lys-Arg  infusion  if  &gt;6.0  mmol/L  (CTCAE Grade 3).

In case nausea or vomiting occurs despite this medication, patients can be treated with other antiemetic drugs at the discretion of the physician.

The sterile amino acid solution and Lutathera are administered in parallel by peripheral vein infusion at a constant infusion rate through pumps or any other infusion system. The infusion with amino acids starts 30 minutes before the start of Lutathera infusion, and continues for a total of 4 h (extension up to 6 h is allowed in case of adverse reactions that require interruption or slowing the infusion rate). During amino acid infusion patient is allowed to void.

Infusion rates are listed in Table 6-5 and see Pharmacy Manual for the infusion system scheme.

Following administration of Lutathera, patients should remain at the clinical site for an additional 4  to  5  hours  in  an  area  with  suitable  radiation  shielding  to  protect  others  from  unnecessary exposure (Appendix 4). At the time of release, patients are given written instructions (Appendix 5) which outline the precautions the patient must take to minimize radiation exposure to people around them.

Crises  due  to  excessive  release  of  hormones  or  bioactive  substances  may  occur  following treatment, therefore, observation of patients by overnight hospitalization should be considered. Recommended  treatments  of  patients  with  hormonal  crises  are:  i.v.  high  dose  somatostatin analogues, i.v. fluids, corticosteroids, and correction of electrolyte disturbances in patients with diarrhea and vomiting.

## 6.6.1 Handling of study treatment and additional treatment

Lutathera, amino acids and octreotide long-acting must be administered at the investigational site. Short-acting octreotide is self-administered by the patient.

Confidential

The study medication must be stored, handled and administered only by qualified/authorized personnel and must be prepared in accordance with pharmaceutical quality requirements, and radiation safety regulations for Lutathera.

Drug inventory and accountability records for the study medication and rescue medication, as well as drug returns by the patient, will be kept by the Investigator/Pharmacist, and must be documented throughout the study. Returned supplies should not be distributed again, not even to the same patient. The Investigator will not supply investigative study medication to any person, except the patients in this study.

The octreotide long-acting and amino acids not used must be stored at site and made available till the monitoring visits, to allow the CRA to monitor the drug accountability.

The used/unused medications, except for Lutathera, which will be locally discarded according to all disposal requirements for radioactive materials, will be returned to the proper local depot for destruction at the study completion or upon expiration, according to IPM/Sponsor decision and approval.

On an ongoing basis the Investigator/Pharmacist agrees to conduct a study medication supply inventory and to record the results of this inventory on the study Medication Accountability Record.  It  must  be  possible  to  reconcile  delivery  records  with  those  of  used  and  unused medication.  Any  discrepancies  must  be  accounted  for  and  explained.  Appropriate  forms  of deliveries and returns must be signed and dated by the responsible person at the clinical site and maintained  as  records.  The  return  or  disposal  of  all  study  medication  will  be  documented appropriately.

## 7 Informed consent procedures

Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing (witnessed, where required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC-approved informed consent.

If applicable, in cases where the subject's representative(s) gives consent (if allowed according to local requirements), the subject must be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the subject is capable of doing so, he/she must indicate agreement by personally signing and dating the written informed consent document.

Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures (e.g. all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent must be documented in the subject source documents.

Advanced  Accelerator  Applications  will  provide  to  investigators  in  a  separate  document  a proposed informed consent form that complies with the ICH GCP guidelines and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the investigator must be agreed by Advanced Accelerator Applications before submission to the IRB/IEC.

Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the IB. This information will be included in the subject informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safety profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an investigator notification or an aggregate safety finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent and then must be discussed with the subject.

Women of child bearing potential must be informed that taking Lutathera can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements. Male subjects must be informed that if a female partner becomes pregnant while he is enrolled in the study, contact with the female partner will be attempted to request her consent to collect pregnancy outcome information. Subjects must be informed of the contraception requirements outlined in the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (Section 5).

A copy of the approved version of all consent forms must be provided to Advanced Accelerator Applications after IRB/IEC approval.

It  is  recommended  that  the  Investigator  inform  the  patient's  general  practitioner  of  his/her participation in the study, provided that the patient has a general practitioner and the patient agrees to disclose this information.

The  informed  consent  form  (ICF)  signed  at  the  time  of  the  inclusion  foresees  the  patient's participation in the Study until the end of the Follow-up Phase (adolescents will sign a dedicated informed consent). Patients should sign an addendum to the consent to participate in the Followup Phase assessment phase only in case they have withdrawn the initially signed consent.

Confidential

After signing an ICF for participation in the study, each patient is given a patient card, which indicates the contact details of the Investigator (e.g. stamp with telephone number), the patient's Subject ID, as well as the medication number. The patient shall carry this card with him/her during participation in the study so that the Investigator may be contacted in case of emergency.

Patients randomized in the Lutathera arm will also receive written instructions which outline the precautions the patient must take to minimize radiation exposure to people around them.

Patients who will decide to participate after progression to the optional Treatment Extension Phase  (cross-over)  or  Re-treatment  Phase  will  need  to  sign  a  new  informed  consent  before starting the treatment.

Confidential

## 8 Visit schedule and assessments

Randomization must be performed once all screening/baseline assessments are complete.

The  baseline  CT/MRI  scan  should  be  taken  possibly  on  the  same  day  of  randomization  or immediately before (within 1 week) to ensure that it reflects the disease status closely before the therapy  start.  The  results  of  baseline  CT/MRI  must  be  assessed  by  Investigator  before randomization.

The screening phase must be shortened as much as possible in order to treat the patients shortly after the informed consent signature.

Randomization  should  occur  as  soon  as  possible  after  all  screening  assessments  have  been completed  and  eligibility confirmed. As  Lutathera production and shipment  will take approximately 12 days, if a patient is randomized in the Lutathera arm, Lutathera first dose must be ordered immediately after randomization.

During the study, patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability in accordance with the Visit Schedules for the Lutathera arm and the octreotide long-acting arm as indicated in Table 8-3, and Table 8-4 (variations of ±1 week in the visits schedule are allowed).

Subjects should be seen for all visits/assessments as outlined in the assessment schedule or as close to the designated day/time as possible. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study treatment for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed  for  the  EOT/Early  Termination  visit  will  be  performed  (Table  8-3).  At  the  EOT/Early Termination visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled, and the adverse event and concomitant medications recorded on the eCRF.

As the date of randomization and the date of first treatment might not be the same, it should be observed that a misalignment may occur between the tumor imaging exams (CT/MRI scans) which  are  scheduled  from  the  date  of  randomization,  and  the  other  clinical  and  laboratory assessments which are scheduled from the first treatment date.

The  assessments  listed  in  Table  8-1  will  be  performed  centrally.  Procedures  for  centralized evaluations will be detailed in the Laboratory Manuals provided to each participating site.

Assessment schedule lists all of the assessments and when they are performed. All data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the subject's source documentation.

-Study patients should be instructed to contact the study investigator (by telephone or email), if there is a change in their health status.

-The study investigator may consider contacting patients more frequently than is required by the study protocol, with frequency selected according to circumstances and including the individual patient's vulnerability to COVID-19 based on their medical condition. When contacting patients, whether by telephone or in writing, the study investigator should record that contact or save written correspondence to the patient medical record or chart so as to assure a proper source documentation for the trial.

-Safety lab testing - The investigator should consider whether it is possible to arrange for the laboratory panels (e.g. chemistry and hematology) to be performed at a local laboratory for those patients who cannot come to the clinical site as scheduled. The investigator should collect and file all local lab reports in the patient medical record or chart.

-Scheduled or unscheduled patient study visits can be performed once feasible and considered safe for patients to attend the clinical appointments.

If contact is made with a patient via telephone/video call, the Visit Date should be entered into the eCRF for the corresponding visit / next closest visit. If multiple contacts are made prior to the next scheduled visit, an unscheduled visit per contact can be entered to capture the Visit Date.

Confidential

CRFs that can be completed as a result of the telephone/video-visit should be completed, e.g. Adverse Events, Concomitant Medications, and Dose Administration Record. If any protocol required assessments were not completed, CRFs should be 'Inactivated' or marked 'Not Done'.

The  Protocol  Deviation  process  will  be  used  to  capture  visits  not  performed  at  site  due  to COVID-19 (see Section 14).

## 8.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics

Each patient's date of birth, gender, ethnicity, weight, height and relevant baseline characteristics will be recorded in the e-CRF.

## 8.1.1 Diagnosis and Extent of Cancer

The  patient's  disease  history,  including  documented  primary  diagnosis  of  gastro-enteropancreatic tumor, date of diagnosis (diagnosis date of metastasized or locally advanced disease should not be greater than 6 months prior to screening), as well as disease status at study entry, will  be  collected.  This  includes  the  date  of  first  diagnosis  and  presence  of  metastases  with specification of the metastatic site(s). TNM criteria will be used for the determination of the stage of disease at the time of first diagnosis.

## 8.1.2 Ki67

All patients are required to have documented local assessment of the Ki67 proliferation index based  on  surgery/biopsy  specimens  of  the  primary  tumor  or  liver  metastases  or  soft  tissue metastases and assessed by microscopy and immunohistochemical staining.

Ki67 must be ≥10% and ≤ 55% for a patient to be eligible.

## 8.1.3 Prior Antineoplastic Medications / Radiotherapy / Surgery

Information pertaining to any chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiation, or surgery  the  patient  has  previously  received  will  be  documented.  Previous  treatment  with somatostatin analogs will be also documented if applicable.

## 8.1.4 SRI Tumor Uptake in Documented Lesions

All patients are required to have [68Ga]-DOTA-TOC (e.g. Somakit-TOC ® ) PET/CT (or MRI when applicable based on target lesions) imaging or [68Ga]-DOTA-TATE PET/CT (or MRI when applicable based on target lesions) imaging (e.g. NETSPOT ® ) or Somatostatin Receptor scintigraphy (SRS) with [111In]-pentetreotide (Octreoscan ®  SPECT/CT)  or SRS with [99mTc]Tektrotyd or [64Cu]-DOTA-TATE PET/CT (or MRI when applicable based on target lesions) imaging  performed  within  3  months  prior  to  the  projected  randomization  date  in  the  study (available exams older than 3 months need to be repeated to evaluate the patient's eligibility).

SRI imaging must be repeated before cross-over (after progression in the control arm), if the patient  participates  to  the  optional  Treatment  Extension  Phase,  and  before  the  optional  retreatment (after progression in the Lutathera arm).

Confidential

SRI tumor uptake in documented target lesions will be assessed locally to evaluate patient's eligibility before randomization, cross-over and re-treatment. Tumor uptake in all target lesions must be greater than the liver uptake.

Images will be also submitted to the central imaging center for a second review: there is no central 'real time' assessment of the SRI images, however the images should be submitted to the central  imaging  center  possibly  within  1  month.  SRI  images  submission  is  not  required  for screening failure patients.

Lytic bone lesions, with an identifiable soft tissue component, evaluated by CT or MRI, can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component otherwise meets the definition of measurability according to RECIST 1.1 (in any case, blastic bone lesions are not measurable). Therefore, if the bone lesion has the characteristic as above, and SRI is positive, the patient may be enrolled.

If the primary tumor has been resected, tumor evaluations including SRI will be performed on metastases.

Operating  details  and  quality  certificates  are  specified  in  the  Imaging  Manual  and  Imaging Charter.

## 8.2 Prior/Concomitant Medications

All medications taken at the start of screening until the end of the Treatment Phase/optional Treatment Extension Phase/optional Re-treatment Phase, or early termination, are to be recorded. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medications taken during this time frame.

During the Follow up Phase, concomitant medications must be collected only if administered for related SAEs/AESI and/or for secondary hematological malignancies. In addition, further antitumor treatments administered after progression must be reported until the end of the Follow up Phase.

If any additional medication or procedure has been given for treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19  during  the  study,  the  site  is  requested  to  please  enter  them  as  a  concomitant medication or procedure (e.g. intubation) and state/ select 'reason' to match the relevant Adverse Event reported when applicable.

Tests performed to diagnose symptoms of COVID-19 should be reported as Adverse Events only per  Section  10.1.1  and  not  duplicated  in  Concomitant  Medications/  Surgical  and  Medical Procedures or equivalent CRFs.

## 8.3 Efficacy Assessment

## 8.3.1 Progression Free Survival

The  primary  efficacy  end-point  is  PFS  as  measured  by  objective  tumor  response,  which  is determined by RECIST criteria, Version 1.1 (Eisenhauer, et al., 2009). Tumor response will be assessed locally and centrally.

Confidential

Triphasic  CT  imaging  is  the  preferred  modality  over  MRI  for  determining  objective  tumor response. Combined PET/CT may be used only if the CT is of similar diagnostic quality as a CT performed without PET, including the utilization of IV contrast media .

The  baseline  CT/MRI  scan  should  be  taken  possibly  on  the  same  day  of  randomization  or immediately before (within 1 week) to ensure that it reflects the disease status closely before the therapy  start.  The  results  of  baseline  CT/MRI  must  be  assessed  by  the  Investigator  before randomization.

The tumor diameters of indicator lesions used for response assessment should be measured in the closest position to that used for the baseline CT or MRI assessment.

Restaging is scheduled at regular intervals in the two treatment arms (week 16±1, week 24±1 and then every 12 ±1 weeks) starting from the date of randomization (see Table 8-3, and Table 8-4). Every effort should be done to avoid differences between these timings for patients in the two arms. In case of delays, the reason of the delay has to be documented and the CT/MRI assessment has to be done as soon as possible.

If a CT/MRI scan is done on the same day of a Lutathera administration (e.g. in case of therapy postponement  due  to  DMT  or  scheduling  issues),  the  scan  should  be  taken  before  the  drug administration.  When  a  CT/MRI  assessment  is  &gt;6  weeks  earlier  or  later  than  the  original schedule, the next reassessments have to be discussed and adjusted with the Medical Monitor of the study in a way to progressively come back to the original schedule.

It is recommended that for each patient identical acquisition and reconstruction protocols be used at all time-points. Central, blinded, real-time IRC (Independent Review Committee) assessment will be conducted for determining progressive disease. Changes from randomization date will be assessed at week 16±1, week 24±1 and then every 12 ±1 weeks until the PFS primary analysis End-Point  has  been  reached,  then  until  Week  72  after  randomization,  unless  the  patient progresses or dies.

Sponsor will notify all the Centers and their Ethic Committees as soon as the 99 PFS events have occurred.

Additional PFS/PFS2 data will be collected up to 3 years from the end of the Treatment Phase of the last patient (during the follow-up phase RECIST 1.1 assessment will be performed only locally every 6 months (± 1 month)).

Additional  imaging  assessments  may  be  performed  at  any  time  during  the  study  at  the investigator's discretion to support the efficacy evaluations for a subject, as necessary. Clinical suspicion  of  disease  progression  at  any  time  requires  a  physical  examination  and  imaging assessments  to  be  performed  promptly  rather  than  waiting  for  the  next  scheduled  imaging assessment. These additional scans should be provided to the IRC for central assessment. If an off-schedule  imaging  assessment  is  performed  because  progression  is  suspected,  subsequent imaging assessments should be performed in accordance with the original imaging schedule.

After progression and during the follow-up every effort must be made by the Investigator to collect  additional  information  on  further  anti-tumor  therapies  and  scan  assessments  outcome (RECIST 1.1 local evaluation) to evaluate the Time to Second Progression (PFS2) in the two study arms.

Confidential

For progressive patients participating in cross-over or re-treatment, CT/MRI scans performed after the cross-over or re-treatment eligibility will follow the visits schedule counted from the 1st Lutathera dose.

For patients that are re-treated with Lutathera, a separate PFS analysis will be conducted during the re-treatment phase using the same definition as in Section 12.5.2 except that the baseline will be based on the tumor assessment which demonstrated progression thus allowing re-treatment with Lutathera.  This PFS analysis during re-treatment will be descriptive only.

Operating  details  and  quality  certificates  are  specified  in  the  Imaging  Manual  and  Imaging Charter. See Section 8.8 for further details.

## 8.3.2 Objective Response Rate (ORR), Duration of Response (DOR), Time to Second Progression (PFS2)

Objective Response Rate (ORR) will be calculated as the rate of patients with a best overall response  of  partial  response  (PR)  or  complete  response  (CR).  Response  duration  will  be calculated from the time of initial response until documented tumor progression.

The Duration of Response (DOR) is defined as the time from initially meeting the criteria for response (CR or PR) until the time of progression by RECIST or death due to underlying disease. DOR will be reported descriptively for each group without comparison between groups.

As additional secondary exploratory end-point (local RECIST assessment), the Time to Second Progression (PFS2) will be assessed in the two study arms. PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to the time of disease progression or death due to any cause (on any treatment) following the first episode of disease progression.

For patients that are re-treated with Lutathera, a separate analysis for ORR, DoR, and PFS2 will be conducted during the re-treatment phase using the same definition as in Section 12.5.2 for ORR and DoR, except that  the  new  baseline  will  be  based  on  the  tumor  assessment  which demonstrated progression thus allowing re-treatment with Lutathera.  The PFS2 definition is the same as that in Section 12.6.1.  This ORR, DoR, and PFS2 analysis during re-treatment will be descriptive only.

It is recognized that the limitation of including cross-over and the lower scans frequency during follow-up will reduce the possibility to reach firm conclusions on PFS2.

After the first progression is confirmed centrally and the second progression is confirmed locally (i.e. after PFS2 event), the sites which do not routinely perform 6-monthly follow up CT/MRI scans for progressive GEP-NET patents can omit this examination at the subsequent patient's visits (no protocol deviation).

## 8.3.3 Overall Survival

Overall Survival (OS) will be calculated from the randomization date until the day of death due to any cause; OS will not be censored if a patient receives other anti-tumor treatments after study medication.

Confidential

Overall  Survival  will  also  be  separately  estimated  for  patients  that  receive  re-treatment  with Lutathera.  The definition for OS is the same to that in Section 12.5.2, and this analysis with retreatment patients will be descriptive only.

Survival data will be analyzed at the time of the analysis of the primary end-point (PFS), and will continue to be assessed up to 4 years from the randomization of the last patient or 6 months after the last cross-over/re-treatment dose in the study, whichever occurs last.

## 8.4 Quality of Life

The  impact  of  treatment  on  health  related  QoL  will  be  assessed  using  the  EORTC  QLQG.I.NET21, EORTC QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-L5 questionnaires, which will be filled in by the patient prior to know CT scan/MRI result. Changes from baseline will be assessed every 12±1 week from the first treatment date until the end of treatment.

Forms in Country-specific languages will be provided by the Sponsor.

## 8.5 Safety and Tolerability

## 8.5.1 Adverse Events

All adverse events (AEs), whether or not spontaneously reported by the patient, will be recorded starting from the signing of the ICF until the end of the Treatment Phase/optional Treatment Extension Phase.

During  the  Follow  up  Phase  only  related  SAEs  and  related  AESI  other  than  secondary hematological malignancies will be recorded. AESI of secondary hematological malignancies will  be  recorded  during  the  whole  study  irrespective  of  causality.  Definitions  and  reporting procedures are outlined in Section 10. An Independent Steering Committee Board will evaluate patient's safety throughout the study (Section 10.2). During the Follow-up Phase, concomitant medications must be collected in the eCRF if administered for related SAEs/AESI and/or for secondary hematological malignancies.

During the COVID-19 pandemic that limits or prevents on-site study visits, regular phone or virtual calls will occur for safety monitoring and discussion of the participant´s health status until the participant can again visit the site.

## 8.5.2 Laboratory Assessments

The laboratory assessments require that blood samples for hematology and blood chemistry, and a urine sample for urinalysis are taken (Table 8-3, and Table 8-4). Laboratory assessments will be performed at the investigational site.

At Screening: all patients will have screening laboratory assessments including hematology and blood chemistry within 3 weeks (preferably 2 weeks in the Lutathera arm) before the projected first treatment date.

During the Treatment Phase (including cross-over and re-treatment):

Confidential

- In the Lutathera arm: within 2 weeks before and 4±1 weeks after each Lutathera treatment. In addition, for the second, third, and fourth Lutathera treatment, an additional laboratory assessment  will  be  performed  on  the  same  day,  or  within  one  day  prior  Lutathera administration. Blood tests performed 4 weeks after any treatment cannot serve as baseline values for the next treatment. After the end of Lutathera treatment, laboratory assessments will be performed every 12+1 weeks (see Table 8-2 and Visit Schedule in Table 8-3).
- In the 60 mg octreotide long-acting arm: throughout the study laboratory assessments will be performed 4 weeks (+3 days) after the first treatment till Week 28, and every 12+1 weeks from Week 36 onwards (see Visit Schedule in Table 8-4).

In  the  event  of  a  significant  laboratory  abnormality,  or  if  clinical  or  laboratory  evidence  of toxicity  occurs,  the  Investigator  will  collect  additional  specimens  for  repeat  or  additional analyses, at intervals appropriate to the abnormality. The patient will be closely followed until sufficient  information is  obtained  to  determine  the  cause  or  the  value  regresses.  Appropriate remedial measures should be taken and the response recorded.

All safety laboratory results must be evaluated by the Investigator before administration of study medication.

Any clinically relevant change from baseline onwards will be recorded on the Adverse Event page  of  the  e-CRF,  possibly  with  a  single  diagnosis  encompassing  all  changes  possibly supporting to the single diagnosis.

During  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  investigator  should  consider  whether  it  is  possible  to arrange for the laboratory tests to be performed at a local laboratory for those patients who cannot come to the clinical site as scheduled. The investigator should collect and file all local lab reports in the patient medical record or chart.

Table 8-2. Laboratory Assessments 1 .

Confidential

- 1 Laboratory assessments performed on the same day or within one day prior to administration of the second, third, and fourth doses of Lutathera must include at minimum:
- serum urea or blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (including creatinine clearance calculation)
- serum potassium, serum total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase
- hemoglobin, platelet count, total leukocyte count, and absolute neutrophil count.
- 2 Before each Lutathera dose, patients must meet the criteria for Hb, WBC, and platelets, as defined in the inclusion criteria, at baseline and before each subsequent treatment. If the patient cannot be retreated due to haematological abnormalities, the evaluation must be repeated at least once weekly until re-treatment.
- 3 Before  each  Lutathera  dose,  patients  must  meet  the  criteria  for  creatinine  clearance  and  total  bilirubin  as  defined  in  the eligibility criteria at baseline and before every re-treatment. As entry criterion, patients must not have creatinine clearance &lt;40 mL/min calculated by the Cockroft Gault method. During the course of the study, if in the Lutathera arm a 40% increase over the baseline serum creatinine value occurs during the course of treatment, or a decrease of over 40% in creatinine clearance as calculated from serum creatinine concentrations according to Cockcroft-Gault formula, DMT rules must apply (Table 6-4) and patients must also have a measured creatinine clearance (or GFR) performed. Measured creatinine clearance should be through a 24-h urine collection. Total urinary protein should also be measured in this collection. If the measured urinary creatinine clearance shows decrease of ≤40% compared to baselin e, treatment can continue.
- The Cockcroft-Gault formula allows this estimation based on the occurrence of creatininemia, and correlating patient muscular mass (and so the consequent creatinine production) to weight, gender and age:

Est. Creatinine Clearance = [[140 - age (yr)]*weight (kg)]/[72*serum Cr(

mg/dL

)]

(multiply by 0.85 for women)

Or

Est. Creatinine Clearance = [[140-age(yr)]*weight (kg)]/[0.814* serum Cr( umol/L )] (multiply by 0.85 for women)

- 4  In South Korea only, CgA assessment being discontinued in Q3 2022 due to lab kits shortage

5  For UK, serum pregnancy test is mandatory at baseline

During the Follow-up Phase, in both study arms laboratory assessments (hematology and blood chemistry) will be performed every 6 months (± 1 month).

## 8.5.3 Pregnancy Test

Women who receive Lutathera in the study, including those who crossed over to Lutathera and those re-treated with Lutathera, should not procreate during Lutathera treatment and until six months after the end of their last treatment with Lutathera, or until the end of treatment period of the study, whichever is longer. Women in the control arm should not procreate until the end of treatment period.

A pregnancy test (either on urine or blood) must be performed at baseline and within 14 days (preferably 7 days) prior to each Lutathera treatment for every female patient of childbearing potential (Section 5 and Appendix 1).

Ionizing  radiations  of  lutetium  (177Lu)  oxodotreotide  may  potentially  have  temporary  toxic effects on female and male gonads (decrease of inhibin-B and concomitant increase of FSH, suggesting radiation damage to Sertoli cells).  Fertility is usually restored 12 to 18 months after treatment.  The  participant  will  be  recommended  to  seek  genetic  consultation  before  starting treatment if the patient wishes to have children after treatment, which includes the option of cryopreservation of sperm or eggs before treatment starts.

For UK only:

Confidential

A pregnancy test (blood) must be performed at baseline in both arms and within 7 days prior to the first Lutathera treatment. A urine or blood pregnancy test must be performed within 7 days prior to each Lutathera treatment for every female patient of childbearing potential (Section 5 and Appendix 1). A urine or blood pregnancy test must be performed in both arms at the end of the relevant systemic exposure to octreotide.

## For Germany only:

A pregnancy test must be performed at baseline in both arms (either on urine or blood). In the Lutathera arm, a urine or blood pregnancy test must be performed monthly during the treatment phase (within 7 days prior to each Lutathera treatment) (Section 5 and Appendix 1) and for the following  six  months  after  the  end  of  treatment  with  Lutathera  for  every  female  patient  of childbearing potential.

## 8.5.4 Cardiac Ejection Fraction

Patients with uncontrolled congestive heart failure (NYHA II, III, IV) are not eligible according to exclusion criteria.

Patients with history of congestive heart failure who do not violate this exclusion criterion will undergo an evaluation of their cardiac ejection fraction prior to randomization via echocardiography.  The  results  from  an  earlier  assessment  (not  exceeding  30  days  prior  to randomization) may substitute the evaluation at the discretion of the Investigator, if no clinical worsening is noted. The patient's measured cardiac ejection fraction in these patients must be ≥40% before randomization.

## 8.5.5 ECG

Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using the device provided by the Sponsor (central assessment).  ECGs  will  be  recorded  at  baseline,  after  each  Lutathera  treatment  procedure (following the completion of the amino acids infusion), at the end of study treatment and at the end of study follow up phase to measure the different ECG intervals (RR, PR, QRS, and a more extended QT evaluation according to ICH E14). ECGs will be taken also in the 60 mg octreotide long-acting  arm  at  same  time  points  (before  the  octreotide  long-acting  injection).  See  ECG Manual for further details and visits schedule in Table 8-3, and Table 8-4).

An ECG in triplicate (at least 5 minutes apart) will be taken supine, after 10 minutes rest, and not immediately after a meal. The parameters will be measured as a mean value of minimally 3 beats.  The  preferred  sequence  of  cardiovascular  data  collection  during  study  visits  is  ECG collection first, followed by vital signs, and blood sampling .

Additional, unscheduled, safety ECGs may be repeated at the discretion of the investigator at any time during the study as clinically indicated. Unscheduled ECGs with clinically significant findings  should  be  collected  in  triplicate.  Local  cardiologist  ECG  assessments  may  also  be performed at any time during the study at the discretion of the investigator.

All  ECGs,  including  unscheduled  triplicate  safety  ECGs  with  clinically  relevant  findings, collected during the study should be transmitted to the central core ECG laboratory for review.

Confidential

The Investigator/local cardiologist will note in the source documents (and in the eCRF) whether the ECG is normal or abnormal, as well as the clinical relevance of abnormal ECGs results based on their own review of the ECG tracing. Relevant abnormalities at baseline will be recorded in the medical history page, while changes during the study will be recorded on the Adverse Event page of the eCRF.

The original ECGs on non-heat-sensitive paper or a certified copy on non-heat sensitive paper, appropriately signed, must be collected and archived at the study site. Any identifier details must be redacted e.g. subject initials, date of birth. Each ECG tracing should be labeled with the study number, subject initials (where regulations permit), subject number, date, and kept in the source documents at the study site.

The  results  of  the  centrally  assessed  ECGs  are  automatically  transferred  into  the  clinical database.

## 8.5.6 Physical Examination and Vital Signs

Physical examinations will be performed by the Investigator, or qualified designee. All body systems will be examined and any relevant findings will be documented in the source documents and  eCRF.  Physical  examinations  should  include  heart  rate,  blood  pressure  and  weight measurement (height will only be measured at baseline). Blood pressure and pulse rate will be performed after the patient rests for 5 minutes. For each patient, all blood pressure recordings shall be made using the same type of instrument (i.e., manual BP recording vs. automatic digital vital signs monitor) on the same arm.

Significant findings that are present prior to baseline will be recorded in the medical history page, while  changes  during  the  study  (including  significant  changes  of  the  symptoms  due  to  the underlying disease vs baseline) will be recorded on the Adverse Event page of the eCRF.

## 8.5.7 Karnofsky Performance Score

KPS forms must be completed by a medical professional at each treatment and follow-up visit, and before any current clinical information is given to the patient (Appendix 3).

## 8.5.8 Ultrasonic examination of the gallbladder (Germany only)

Only for Germany:

Ultrasonic examination of the gallbladder before and at six-monthly intervals during Octreotide LAR treatment in order to detect and prevent possible cholecystitis and biliary duct dilatation risks for the patients is recommended according to the Octreotide label.

## 8.5.9 SPECT/CT and whole body planar imaging (Germany only)

Only for Germany:

Confidential

SPECT/CT imaging and whole body planar imaging should be performed after each Lutathera injection (local assessment only), as per local standards. The dosimetry results will be collected in eCRF.

In  other  Countries,  physicians  may  also  decide  to  perform  SPECT/CT  scans  for  treatment verification purposes following the drug administration(s), based on institutional guidelines and their discretion.

## 8.5.10 Assessments Schedule

The Assessment Schedule in the two study arms is shown in Table 8-3, and Table 8-4.

In the Lutathera arm, safety laboratory assessments will be performed within 2 weeks before and 4±1 weeks after each Lutathera treatment. In addition, for the second, third and fourth Lutathera treatment,  an  additional  safety  laboratory  assessment  will  be  performed  on  the  same  day  or within one day before each treatment (see Table 8-2).

The Lutathera treatment / assessment schedule shown in Table 8-3 is idealized in the sense that all Lutathera treatments occur at defined 8-week interval (±1 week). In the event that the intervals are greater than the defined 8-week interval (±1 week), the investigator will need to ensure that the  correct  safety  assessments  before  and  after  each  treatment  have  been  conducted  (safety assessments  must  be  performed  within  2  weeks  before  and  4  weeks  after  each  Lutathera treatment, see Table 8-3).

Exams to be done in relation to the Lutathera treatments (within two weeks before the infusion, one the day of the infusion, 4±1 weeks after infusion) can be combined with those required at other visits during the study, if less than 2 weeks apart.

During the Follow-up Phase, in both study arms study visits will be performed every 6 months (± 1 month) up to 3 years.

## -TREATMENT PHASE:

-  TREATMENT: 30 mg octreotide long-acting injections to be administered the day after each Lutathera infusion
-  TREATMENT: Lutathera; 4 administrations at 8±1-week intervals
- Due to the 6 weeks washout prior to each Lutathera injection, octreotide long-acting 30 mg is administered every 8 weeks during Lutathera treatment (including during the optional treatment extension phase) and every 4 weeks after last Lutathera treatment. IF REQUIRED, RESCUE TREATMENTS: Octreotide s.c. injections (to be stopped 24 h before each Lutathera infusion)
- 1Before the PFS primary analysis (i.e. 99 evaluable and centrally confirmed disease progressions or death events), patients continue the Treatment Phase until progression. After the PFS primary analysis, the Treatment Phase duration becomes fixed (72 weeks).
- 3Randomization must be performed once all screening assessments are complete. The screening phase must be shortened as much as possible in order to treat the patients possibly within 2 weeks from the consent date. As Lutathera production and shipment will take approximately 12 days to be arranged, if a patient is randomized in the Lutathera arm, Lutathera first dose must be ordered immediately after randomization. The baseline CT/MRI scan should be taken possibly on the same day of randomization or immediately before (within 1 week) to ensure that it reflects
- 2Via echocardiography, only in patients with history of congestive heart failure (patients with uncontrolled congestive heart failure (NYHA II, III, IV) aren't eligible according to exclusion criteria)
- the disease status closely before the therapy start.
- 5CgA assessment being discontinued in Q3 2022 due to lab kits shortage in South Korea only
- 4Additional pregnancy tests for Germany only. The pregnancy test at EoT is for Germany and UK.
- 6There is no central 'real time' assessment of the SRI images; the images should be submitted to the central imaging center possibly within 1 month.
- 8Only related SAEs &amp; AESI will be collected during the Follow-up Phase, with the exception of AESI of secondary hematological malignancies which will be collected during the Follow-up Phase irrespective of causality (see Section 10.1.5 for AESI definition).
- 7SPECT/CT and WBPI post Lutathera injection requested in Germany only.
- 9Only if a scan was not taken in the previous 12 weeks; if no post-baseline scan is available, a scan is needed at EOT.
- 11Only if a scan was not taken in the previous 6 months.
- 10For patients who entered the Lutathera re-treatment phase, since there are no procedures requiring in-person patient's attendance, the following visits can be performed by phone: Visits W32, 40, 44, 52, 56, 64 and 68 following Lutathera re-treatment (for Germany only: visits W56, 64 and 68). Post progression Re-Treatment Eligibility CT/MRI scan doesn't need to be repeated if performed within the previous 12 weeks. Both Re-treatment Eligibility SRI and CT/MRI scans need to be submitted to the central imaging center for a second review: there is no central 'real time' assessment of the Re-treatment Eligibility SRI uptake; however, the images should be submitted to the central imaging center possibly within 1 month.
- 12During  Follow-up  Phase  and  at  the  EOS  visit,  concomitant  medications  must  be  collected  only  if  administered  for  related  SAEs/AESI  and/or  for secondary hematological malignancies. In addition, all new anticancer therapies administered must be collected till EOS.

## -TREATMENT PHASE:

-  TREATMENT: Lutathera; 4 administrations at 8±1-week intervals
-  TREATMENT: 60 mg octreotide long-acting injections every 4 weeks (±3 days)

## -OPTIONAL EXTENSION TREATMENT PHASE:

-  TREATMENT: 30 mg octreotide long-acting injections to be administered the day after each Lutathera infusion
- Due to the 6 weeks washout prior to each Lutathera injection, octreotide long-acting 30 mg is administered every 8 weeks during Lutathera treatment. IF REQUIRED, RESCUE TREATMENTS: Octreotide s.c. injections (to be stopped 24 h before each Lutathera infusion).
- 1Before the PFS primary analysis (i.e. 99 evaluable and centrally confirmed disease progressions or death events), patients continue the Treatment Phase until progression. After the PFS primary analysis, the Treatment Phase duration becomes fixed (72 weeks).
- 3Via echocardiography, only in patients with history of congestive heart failure (patients with uncontrolled congestive heart failure (NYHA II, III, IV) aren't eligible according to exclusion criteria).
- 2Any progressive patient (based on central imaging assessment) has the option to enroll for post-progression cross-over to Lutathera, upon signature of a new consent, if the eligibility criteria are met. If RECIST progression occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis, the decision to enroll the patient in cross-over will be based on local assessment. The EoT visit and evaluation of cross-over eligibility can occur on the same day. If these two visits are done on separate days, EoT can be done remotely by phone, and all applicable assessments can be done at the cross-over eligibility visit. If a patient continues to cross-over, 28-day window for EoT visit does not need to apply.
- 4Randomization must be performed once all screening assessments are complete. The screening phase must be shortened as much as possible in order to treat the patients possibly within 2 weeks from the consent date. The baseline CT/MRI scan should be taken possibly on the same day of randomization or immediately before (within 1 week) to ensure that it reflects
- 5Additional pregnancy test for UK only.
- the disease status closely before the therapy start.
- 6CgA assessment being discontinued in Q3 2022 due to lab kits shortage in South Korea only
- 8PK assessment is done in all Countries, except China.
- 7There is no central 'real time' assessment of the SRI images; the images should be submitted to the central imaging center possibly within 1 month.
- 9Only related SAEs &amp; AESI will be collected during the Follow-up Phase, with the exception of AESI of secondary hematological malignancies which will be collected during the Follow-up Phase irrespective of causality (see Section 10.1.5 for AESI definition).
- 11Only if a scan was not taken in the previous 6 months
- 10Only if a scan was not taken in the previous 12 weeks; if no post-baseline scan is available, a scan is needed at EOT. Post progression Cross-Over Eligibility CT/MRI scan doesn't need to be repeated if performed within the previous 12 weeks. Both Cross-over Eligibility SRI and CT/MRI scans need to be submitted to the central imaging center for a second review: there is no central 'real time' assessment of the Crossover Eligibility SRI uptake; however, the images should be submitted to the central imaging center possibly within 1 month.
- 12During Follow-up and at the EOS visit, concomitant medications must be collected only if administered for related SAEs/AESI and/or for secondary hematological malignancies. In addition, all new anticancer therapies administered must be collected till EOS.

## 8.6 Pharmacokinetics

This section is applicable to all countries, except for China. No PK samples will be collected in China.

The steady-state plasma concentrations of high dose octreotide long-acting will be assessed in the control arm of the study.

All  samples  will  be  taken  by  either  direct  venipuncture  or  indwelling  cannula  inserted  in  a forearm vein. Blood samples (2.5 mL each sample) will be collected to yield approximately 1 mL  plasma  for  analysis  of  octreotide  concentration.  Immediately  after  blood  is  drawn  into K3EDTA tubes,  they  should  be  inverted  gently  several  times  to  ensure  the  mixing  of  tube contents. Prolonged exposure to rubber stopper should be avoided. The tube should be placed upright in tube rack surrounded by ice until centrifugation. Within 20 minutes, the sample should be centrifuged between 3ºC and 5ºC for 10 minutes at approximately 1000 x g. Immediately after centrifugation, 1.0 mL plasma should be transferred to a polypropylene screw-cap tube immersed in dry ice. The storage temperature for PK samples should be at or below minus 20°C (-20°C). The samples will be sent to an external laboratory for central assessment (see further details in the PK Manual).

Table 8-5. Octreotide long-acting PK blood collection plan

## CONTROL ARM

| Sample   |   Volume (mL) |   Week |   PK Collection # | Scheduled time (h)   |
|----------|---------------|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Blood    |           2.5 |      4 |                 1 | 0 (pre-dose)*        |
| Blood    |           2.5 |     12 |                 2 | 0 (pre-dose)*        |
| Blood    |           2.5 |     16 |                 3 | 0 (pre-dose)*        |
| Blood    |           2.5 |     24 |                 4 | 0 (pre-dose)*        |

*Blood sample for PK must be collected before octreotide long-acting injection.

## 8.6.1 Analytical method

Octreotide plasma concentration will be measured using a validated radio-immunoassay (RIA). All PK samples will be shipped to the central laboratory where they will be stored and forwarded to the pharmacokinetic facility for bioanalysis.

## 8.7 Biomarkers

Serum  Chromogranin  A  (CgA)  will  be  locally  assessed  at  12-weeks  intervals  during  the treatment.  The  CgA  assessment  is  discontinued  in  South  Korea  in  Q3  2022  due  to  lab  kits shortage.

Confidential

## 8.8 Imaging

Central,  blinded,  real-time  IRC  (Independent  Review  Committee)  CT/MRI  assessment  is implemented in this trial. Images will be also assessed by the site local radiologist.

The primary efficacy end-point of the study is PFS as measured by objective tumor response, which is determined by RECIST criteria, Version 1.1 (Eisenhauer, et al., 2009). Sponsor will notify all the Centers and their Ethic Committees as soon as the 99 PFS primary End-Points have occurred.

Changes  from  randomization  date  will  be  assessed  centrally  until  the  completion  of  the Treatment Phase, unless the patient progresses or dies. Additional PFS data will be collected up to 3 years (follow-up phase) from the end of Treatment Phase of the last patient. If a patient participates after progression to the optional Treatment Extension Phase or optional Re-treatment Phase, scans will be assessed locally according RECIST 1.1, according to the frequency indicated in Table 8-3, and Table 8-4.

During the Treatment Phase, restaging is scheduled at week 16±1, week 24±1 and then every 12 ±1 weeks (from the date of randomization). The first CT/MRI re-staging at week 16 will ensure that control arm patients who are SSA-naïve will receive at least 12 weeks of octreotide longacting full dose (60mg) after the completion of the dose escalation phase (see Section 6.5.2), while patients in the Lutathera arm will receive at least 2 Lutathera doses before the first tumor response assessment.  As described in Section 12.8.1, the study sample size has been estimated considering a median PFS of approximately 15 months in the control arm and 30 months in the Lutathera arm, therefore the proposed CT/MRI schedule, and in particular, the first re-staging at week 16, is consistent with the protocol assumptions.

Clinical  suspicion  of  disease  progression  before  week  16  and  at  any  time  during  the  study requires a physical examination and imaging assessments to be performed promptly rather than waiting for the next scheduled imaging assessment. These additional scans should be provided to the IRC for central assessment. If an off-schedule imaging assessment is performed because progression is suspected, subsequent imaging assessments should be performed in accordance with the original imaging schedule.

In case of delays, the reason of the delay must be documented, and the CT/MRI assessment must be done as soon as possible. When a CT/MRI assessment is &gt; 6 weeks earlier or later than the original  schedule,  the  next  reassessments  must  be  discussed  and  adjusted  with  the  Medical Monitor of the study in a way to progressively return to the original schedule.

Every effort should be made to avoid differences between these timings for patients in the two arms, unless this would result in a deviation of the protocol (re-staging at week 16±1, week 24±1 and then every 12 ±1 weeks from randomization). The CT/MRI scans should be avoided in the 6-weeks period following Lutathera administration due to the  PRRT-induced  pseudoprogression  phenomenon  described  in  literature  (Brabander,  et  al.,  Pitfalls  in  the  response evaluation  after  peptide  receptor  radionuclide  therapy  with  [177Lu-DOTA0,Tyr3]octreotate., 2017b). If a CT/MRI scan is planned on the same day of a Lutathera treatment, the scan must be taken before the drug administration. As reported by Brabander et al. (2017b), an increase in the diameter of lesions of 10% or more on imaging was seen in 9% of patients with SD at 6 weeks

Confidential post PRRT and was reversible at 6 months follow-up in 50% of patients. This transient increase was probably caused by inflammation causing localized oedematous tissue at the site of the metastases and not based on progression. This radiogenic oedema has been described previously for PRRT and external beam radiation of brain tumors (Kneifel, et al., 2006; Barani &amp; Larson, 2015). In studies with cytokines, cancer vaccines and monoclonal antibodies an early increase in tumor burden has been demonstrated in patients with CR, PR or SD as treatment outcome. This phenomenon was described as pseudo-progression and resulted in a new response method, the immune-related response criteria (irRC) (Wolchok, et al., 2009). This increase in the tumor size after  immunotherapy is probably related to infusion of lymphocytes and macrophages in the tumor and new lesions are not always considered as PD.

In  case  of  discrepancies  between  Investigator  and  central  assessor  on  the  evaluation  of  the progression of disease, the following is recommended:

1. Investigator assessment: non-PD; central assessment: PD. The Treatment Phase of the study  is  terminated  and  the  patient  should  proceed  to  the  Follow-up  Phase.  The investigator may request the continuation of treatment (Lutathera until the cumulative dose  limit  has  been  reached  and/or  octreotide  long-acting  provided  by  the  Sponsor according to randomization; 12-week local tumor assessments; safety assessments as in the treatment/assessment phase of the study) until progression has been documented by the Investigator, thereafter, the patient will proceed to the follow-up assessment phase. Alternatively, the patient can be enrolled in the optional Treatment Extension Phase, if the eligibility criteria are met (see Section 5.2.1).
2. Investigator assessment: PD; central assessment: non-PD. The Treatment Phase of the study should be continued as planned. However, the Investigator may decide to withdraw the patient from the Treatment Phase because of unethical continuation of the study in his/her opinion, and start the Follow-up Phase of the study. Such cases should be limited as much as possible and discussed with the Sponsor Medical Monitor before withdrawing the patient and all attempts should be made to continue central scans assessment until central confirmation of progression according to RECIST.

The coded medical images will be used primarily for analysis as described in this  protocol; however,  the  images  may  also  be  used  for  the  development  and  evaluation  of  new  analysis methods directly related to the area of research that this study covers.

The methods for assessment and recording are specified in the imaging manual and imaging charter.

See Section 8.3.1 for further details.

## 9 Study discontinuation and completion

## 9.1 Discontinuation

## 9.1.1 Discontinuation of study treatment

Discontinuation of study treatment for a subject occurs when study treatment is stopped earlier than the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the subject or the investigator.

The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given subject if, he/she believes that continuation would negatively impact the subject's well-being.

Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances:

- Disease progression
- Unacceptable adverse event, including meeting stopping criteria as described in Section 6.5.2
- Subject/guardian decision
- Pregnancy
- Use of prohibited treatment as per recommendations in Section 6.2.3
- Any situation in which study participation might result in a safety risk to the subject.

If discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to understand the primary reason for the subject's premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this information.

In  extraordinary  situations  due  to  the  very  short  half-life  of  radionuclides,  e.g.  a  sudden temporary supply disruption and/or a quality finding after release of the product, the investigator may immediately be:

1. advised on how to manage participants in screening or on treatment;
2. informed  to  withhold  doses  from  impacted  batch  and  not  administer  them  to  the participant;

and/or

3. asked to closely monitor participants who have received a dose from an impacted batch for adverse events.

Subjects who discontinue study treatment or who decide they do not wish to participate in the study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study UNLESS they withdraw their consent.  Where  possible,  they  should  return  for  the  assessments  indicated  in  the  assessment schedule. If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g. telephone, e-mail, letter) should be made to contact the subject/predesignated contact as specified in the lost to follow-up section (Section 9.1.3). This contact should preferably be done according to the study visit schedule.

Confidential

If the subject cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular telephone contact with the subject, or with a person pre-designated by the subject. This telephone contact should preferably be done according to the study visit schedule.

After study treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact (per assessment schedule in Table 8-3 and Table 8-4):

- new  /  concomitant  treatments  including  any  radiotherapy,  surgical  procedure  or  new anticancer therapy
- adverse events/Serious Adverse Events
- survival status

During the COVID-19 pandemic, for patients who are unable to come to the study site for their scheduled visit, conducting patient study visits on schedule by telephone may be possible. As patient safety is the number one concern, patients may need to discontinue treatment based on the investigator's clinical judgment or patient's own decision. The investigator should document in the source notes as clearly as possible the decisions made around continuing or discontinuing study treatment for a patient and the risk-benefit for each case as it may arise. The investigator should  consider  if  alternative  therapeutic  options  exist  and  may  be  warranted  based  on  the individual benefit-risk for the patient.

## 9.1.1.1 Replacement policy

Not applicable. Subjects will not be replaced on study.

A subject can be re-screened with a new study number when intercurrent conditions emerging after consent signature and impeding the planned randomization are resolved. Such cases must be discussed and approved by the Sponsor. The site will be informed about the procedures to be followed for re-screening.

## 9.1.2 Withdrawal of informed consent

Withdrawal of consent/opposition to use of data and/or biological samples occurs in countries where the legal justification  to collect  and  process  the  data  is  based  on  consent  and  when  a participant:

- Explicitly requests to stop use of their data and
- No longer wishes to receive study treatment and
- Does not want any further visits or assessments (including further study-related contacts)

In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e-mail, letter) to  understand  the  primary  reason  for  the  subject's  decision  to  withdraw  his/her  consent  and record this information.

Confidential

Study treatment must be discontinued, and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. All efforts should be made to have any study drug returned to the Investigator.

Further  attempts  to  contact  the  subject  are  not  allowed  unless  safety  findings  require communicating or follow-up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the subject's study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table.

Advanced Accelerator Applications will continue to retain and use all research results (data) that have already been collected for the study evaluation.

## 9.1.3 Lost to follow-up

For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an  intention  to  discontinue  or  withdraw,  the  investigator  must  show  "due  diligence"  by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A subject should not be considered as lost to follow-up until due diligence has been completed or until the end of the study.

## 9.1.4 Early study termination by the sponsor

The study can be terminated by Advanced Accelerator Applications at any time for any reason. This may include reasons related to the benefit/ risk assessment of participating in the study, practical reasons (including slow enrollment), or for regulatory or medical reasons. In taking the decision  to  terminate,  Advanced  Accelerator  Applications  will  always  consider  the  subject welfare and safety. Should early termination be necessary, subjects must be seen as soon as possible (provide instruction for contacting the subject, when the subject should stop taking drug, when the subject should come for a final visit) and treated as a prematurely withdrawn subject. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject ' s interests. The investigator or sponsor depending on the local regulation will be responsible for informing IRBs/IECs of the early termination of the trial.

## 9.2 Study completion and post-study treatment

Subjects will be followed during the study per the schedule of assessments (refer to Table 8-3 and Table 8-4).

Before the PFS primary analysis (99 evaluable and centrally confirmed disease progressions or death events), patients continue the Treatment Phase until progression; after the PFS primary analysis, the Treatment Phase duration becomes fixed (72 weeks).

Following the end of treatment or early treatment discontinuation, alive patients will enter in the Follow up Phase unless unfeasible (e.g. consent withdrawal, patient lost to follow-up). All treated subjects should have a safety follow up visit conducted 30 days after last administration of study treatment (EoT visit). The information collected is kept as source documentation. Documentation of attempts to contact the subject should be recorded in the source documentation.

Confidential

At any time during the study (before or after the primary End-Point analysis) any progressive patient  (based  on  central  imaging  assessment)  immediately  ceases  the  Treatment  Phase  and proceeds to the Follow-up Phase assessment.

Patients randomized in the control arm have the option to enroll for post-progression cross-over upon signature of a new consent (optional Treatment Extension Phase) and receive maximum 4 cycles of Lutathera (7.4 GBq / 200 mCi x 4 cycles; cumulative dose: 29.6 MBq / 800mCi) plus octreotide long-acting every 8 weeks. For these patients, the EoT visit and evaluation of crossover eligibility can occur on the same day. If these two visits are done on separate days, EoT can be  done  remotely  by  phone,  and  all  applicable  assessments  can  be  done  at  the  cross-over eligibility visit. If a patient continues to cross-over, 28-day window for EoT visit does not need to apply.

Patients  randomized  in  the  Lutathera  arm  have  the  option  to  enroll  for  post-progression  Retreatment Phase upon signature of a new consent and receive 2-4 additional cycles of Lutathera (7.4 GBq / 200 mCi) every 8 weeks. Re-treatment Phase will last until a locally confirmed disease progression or until EoS, whichever occurs first.

The control arm patients who will consent to post-progression cross-over with Lutathera, and the Lutathera arm patients who will consent to post-progression re-treatment with Lutathera, will continue study assessments as planned in Table 8-4; these patients will enter in the Follow up Phase after the end of Lutathera treatment.

The End of Study (EOS) is when 4 years have elapsed from the randomization of the last patient, or  6  months  after  the  last  cross-over  or  re-treatment  dose,  whichever  occurs  last.  The  time window to start cross-over/re-treatment is further discussed in Sections 5.2.1, 5.2.2 and 9.2.1.

At the End of Treatment (EOT) or End of Study (EOS) or early discontinuation visit, any repeat assessments associated with this visit  should  have  been  documented  and  followed-up appropriately by the Investigator, or in the event of an early study termination decision, the date and reason of that decision.

At the EoT, a CT/MRI scan for RECIST assessment is required only if not taken in the previous 12 weeks. If no post-baseline scan is available, a scan is needed at EoT. At the EoS, a CT/MRI scan for RECIST assessment is required only if a scan was not taken in the previous 6 months.

Each subject will complete their EOS visit at the end of the study (after 3 years of follow up from the end of the Treatment Phase, at early withdrawal from the study, death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up or when the end of study is communicated by Sponsor). The last 6-monthly follow-up visit will  be  considered  EOS  visit,  when  all  assessments  need  to  be  performed  as indicated in the Assessment Schedule for EOS.

Post relapse therapy will be permitted during the study in the Follow-up Period per Investigator discretion, but not provided or administered as study treatment.

The final OS analysis will be performed when the last subject completes their EOS visit. All available data from all subjects up to this cut-off date will be analyzed. All adverse events during the study period must be reported as described in Section 10.

Confidential

In the event the study is terminated due to futility, study subjects currently on study treatment in the Treatment Phase and who are still deriving clinical benefit will be eligible to continue their Lutathera treatment through a locally established Advanced Accelerator Applications program. Lutathera treatment through a locally established Advanced Accelerator Applications program will not be part of this clinical trial and will follow the applicable local regulations.

## 9.2.1 Post-trial access to Lutathera

The time window to start re-treatment in this study is within 4 years after the last patient has been randomized (Section 3.4). Patients who are eligible to Lutathera re-treatment beyond this window and would derive clinical benefit from it based on the investigator's evaluation may receive post-trial access (PTA) to Lutathera. PTA to Lutathera may be granted via Post Study Drug Supply (PSDS) programs, based on local regulation in a non-trial setting. The PSDS must comply with local laws and regulations in the participating trial countries.

## 10 Safety monitoring and reporting

## 10.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements

## 10.1.1 Adverse events

An  adverse  event  (AE)  is  any  untoward  medical  occurrence  (e.g.,  any  unfavorable  and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product.

The  investigator  has  the  responsibility  for  managing  the  safety  of  individual  subject  and identifying adverse events.

Abnormal laboratory values or test results occurring after informed consent constitute adverse events  only  if  they  induce  clinical  signs  or  symptoms,  are  considered  clinically  significant, require therapy (e.g., hematologic abnormality that requires transfusion or hematological stem cell support), or require changes in study medication(s).

The  investigator  has  the  responsibility  for  managing  the  safety  of  individual  subject  and identifying adverse events.

AAA qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems.

Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent must be recorded in the Adverse Events eCRF. Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent must be recorded in the Medical History page of the subject's eCRF. Adverse event monitoring must be continued for at least 30 days (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) following the last dose of study  treatment.  Adverse  events  (including  lab  abnormalities  that  constitute  AEs)  must  be described  using  a  diagnosis  whenever  possible,  rather  than  individual  underlying  signs  and symptoms. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom must be reported as a separate Adverse Event.

The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non-directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments.

Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms, or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following information (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 10.1.2):

1. The Severity grade OR the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) AE grade.
- a. If 'severity grade' is selected, include the following:
- i. mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities

Confidential

- ii. moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities
- iii. severe: prevents normal activities
- b. If 'CTCAE grade' is selected, include the following:
- i. Adverse events will be assessed and graded from 1 to 5.
2. Its relationship to the study treatment. If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of causality will usually be ' Not suspected. ' The rationale for this guidance is that the symptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness are not caused by the trial drug, they happen  in  spite  of  its  administration  and/or  both  lack  of  efficacy  and  progression  of underlying disease can only be evaluated meaningfully by an analysis of cohorts, not on a single patient
3. Its  duration  (start  and  end  dates)  or  if  the  event  is  ongoing,  an  outcome  of  not recovered/not resolved must be reported.
4. Whether  it  constitutes  a  SAE  (see  Section  10.1.2  for  definition  of  SAE)  and  which seriousness criteria have been met.
5. Action taken regarding with study treatment
6. All adverse events must be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the following:
- Dose not changed
- Dose Reduced
- Drug interrupted/withdrawn
7. Its outcome i.e., its recovery status or whether it was fatal

If the event worsens the event should be reported a second time in the eCRF noting the start date when the event worsens in toxicity. For grade 3 and 4 adverse events only, if improvement to a lower grade is determined a new entry for this event should be reported in the eCRF noting the start date when the event improved from having been Grade 3 or Grade 4.

Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in the medical history of the patient.

Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms.

Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent (e.g. continuing at the end of the study), and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.

Confidential

Information  about  adverse  drug  reactions  for  the  investigational  drug  can  be  found  in  the Investigator's Brochure (IB).

Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria:

- they induce clinical signs or symptoms
- they are considered clinically significant
- they require therapy

Clinically  significant  abnormal  laboratory  values  or  test  results  must  be  identified  through  a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non-typical in subjects with the underlying disease.

Progression  of  GEP-NET  (including  fatal  outcomes),  if  documented  by  use  of  appropriate method, should not be reported as a serious adverse event, except if the investigator considers that progression of malignancy is related to study treatment.

If patients in the study have been infected and/or tested for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), sites should capture the patient-relevant details in the patient charts/source data, i.e. start and end dates of  suspected  infection  when  information  is  available,  any  date  of  test(s)  performed,  test name/method together with the result (positive/ negative), treatment interruptions or discontinuations for each of the impacted patients enrolled in the trial.

If an infection is suspected based on symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, sites are requested to enter an AE with AE term as 'Suspected COVID-19' or as 'Confirmed COVID-19' if confirmed by testing (e.g. antigen/radiologic)

- For Suspected cases, if a test is performed and confirms COVID-19, sites are requested to update the Suspected COVID-19 AE record with AE term as 'Confirmed COVID-19', however, not altering the start date.
- For Suspected cases, if a test is performed and does not confirm COVID-19, sites are requested to follow the normal Adverse Event reporting process and record the AE term as the diagnosis, or if no diagnosis, the symptoms. If COVID-19 is still suspected (e.g. false negative suspected), the AE term can remain as 'Suspected COVID-19' per the Investigator's judgement.

In normal circumstances, 'testing' for COVID-19 would not be reported as an Adverse Event, however, in order to adequately capture the impact of COVID-19 on trial patients, these will be required to understand the patients' health status and sequence of events for tests performed to diagnose symptoms of COVID-19.

- -If a test was/tests were performed; sites are requested to enter additional AE(s) with appropriate AE term for the type of test with the result, such as 'SARS-CoV-2 test negative', 'SARS-CoV2 test positive', etc.
- -Start Date and End Date should be entered as the date of the test

Confidential

- -All other fields on Adverse Event CRFs should remain blank. Any resulting queries will be closed by Data Management
- -Tests performed after a patient has died should not be reported as Adverse Events

The infection is considered serious and to be reported as Serious Adverse Event (SAE) only when it  fulfills  the  protocol  definition  of  a  Serious  Adverse  Events  (see  Section  10.1.2  and Section 10.1.6).

## 10.1.2 Serious adverse events

An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)] undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria:

- fatal
- life-threatening
- Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the ICH-E2D Guidelines).
- results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
- constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect
- requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for:
- ­ Routine  treatment  or  monitoring  of  the  studied  indication  not  associated  with  any deterioration in condition.
- ­ Elective  or  pre-planned  treatment  for  a  pre-existing  condition  that  is  unrelated  to  the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the information consent
- ­ social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject's general condition
- ­ treatment  on  an  emergency  outpatient  basis  for  an  event  not  fulfilling  any  of  the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission
- medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Such events should be considered as 'medically significant'. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do

not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse (please refer to the ICHE2D Guidelines).

All  malignant  neoplasms  will  be  assessed  as  serious  under  'medically  significant'  if  other seriousness criteria are not met and the malignant neoplasm is not a disease progression of the study indication.

Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.

All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred.

COVID-19 infections are considered serious and have to be reported as Serious Adverse Event (SAE) only when it fulfills the protocol definition of a Serious Adverse Events. All SAE data should be entered as per the study level CRF completion guidelines e.g. report outcome as 'fatal' if the patient died due to COVID-19.

In case a patient died due to COVID-19, it must be clear from the eCRF if the death was due to underlying  COVID-19  or  a  different  reason.  Therefore,  'Primary  Cause/  Reason  for  Death' should indicate 'Suspected COVID-19' or 'Confirmed COVID-19'. If a test is performed after the patient died and the assessment indicates death was due to COVID-19 infection, the 'Primary Cause/ Reason for Death' should be retrospectively changed from 'Suspected COVID-19' to 'Confirmed COVID-19'.

## 10.1.3 Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)

An ADR is any noxious and unintended response to an IMP related to any dose with at least a reasonably  possible  causal  relationship  with  the  IMP.  Briefly,  an  ADR  is  an  AE  which  is suspected to be possibly related to IMP by either the investigator or the study sponsor.

## 10.1.4 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs)

An ADR will be assessed to be 'unexpected ' if the nature, severity or frequency of the event is not consistent with the applicable product information available for the IMP. An ADR will be assessed to be 'expected ' if it is listed in the Investigator's Brochure.

A SUSAR is an adverse event regarded as serious with at least possible causal relationship to the drug, the nature, severity or frequency of which is not consistent with the applicable information available in the reference documents available for the IMP.

In the case of octreotide, 'expectedness' will be assessed based on octreotide Reference Safety Information (RSI) reported in the prescribing information.

## 10.1.5 Adverse Events of Special Interest

AESI are defined as events (serious or non-serious) which are ones of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor's product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid

Confidential communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor is appropriate. Such events require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them.

AESI are defined based on the NETTER-1 study established AESI list as well as on the basis of an  ongoing  review  of  the  safety  data  collected  during  Lutathera  clinical  programs  and  post marketing.

These potential risks deserve special attention even if they do not fulfill any of the seriousness criteria. AESI occurring in patients enrolled in both arms should be reported to the Sponsor for safety analysis following the reporting procedure and timelines for SAEs. During the treatment phase, all AESI need to be reported to the Sponsor irrespective of causality. During the followup phase, AESI need to be reported only if considered related to the study treatment except for all  secondary hematological malignancies which need to be reported as AESI irrespective of causality.

The following AESI categories representing main risks of Lutathera and amino acid treatment are listed in Table 10-1.

Table 10-1. Adverse events of special interest

| AESI categories                          |
|------------------------------------------|
| Hematotoxicity                           |
| Secondary hematological malignancies     |
| Nephrotoxicityg                          |
| Cardiovascular and electrolyte disorders |

Hematotoxicity: The main critical organ of Lutathera treatment is the bone marrow. Significant hematotoxicity, defined as Grade 2 or higher thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 or 4 of anaemia, leuko-/neutropenia are considered dose-modifying toxicities in the study and must be reported as  AESI  when  not  strictly  fulfilling  the  criteria  of  serious  adverse  events.  Haematological toxicities  regardless  of  severity  must  be  reported  as  AESI  if  accompanied  by  clinical consequences,  i.e.,  infections  in  the  presence  of  leuko-/neutro-/lymphopenia,  hemorrhages  / purpuric lesions under thrombocytopenia that is not explained by another coagulation disorder, dyspnea / fatigue in the presence of anaemia not otherwise explained by the underlying carcinoid syndrome or other co-morbidity.

Secondary haematological malignancies : any secondary hematological malignancies, irrespective  of  causality,  including  MDS  and  acute  myeloid  leukemia,  should  be  reported  in every case,  as AESI/SAE.

Nephrotoxicity: Since Lutathera is cleared through the kidneys and reabsorbed by the kidneys, the kidneys have always been considered the 'critical organs'. An infusion of sterile amino acid is  used for kidneys protection by inhibition of tubular reabsorption of Lutathera. Pursuant to these risk minimization efforts and in addition to the criteria of dose-modifying toxicities and criteria of inclusion (at baseline and before subsequent treatments) pertinent to renal function measurements, renal and urinary tract toxicities are considered AESI. Investigators must report as AESI renal toxicities, including renal failure (ranging from significantly reduced measured or estimated creatinine clearance to clinically overt renal failure other than that of obvious non-

Confidential

IMP-induced origin), suspected radiation nephropathy of any type, such as radiation-induced thrombotic microangiopathy (manifested with, e.g., proteinuria, hypertension, edema, anaemia, decrease serum haptoglobin), or general symptoms and signs of acute radiation toxicity (e.g., increased  frequency  and  urgency  of  urination,  nocturia,  dysuria,  bladder  spasm,  bladder obstruction, genitourinary ulceration or necrosis).

Cardiovascular and electrolyte disorders: All clinically significant changes in blood pressure, heart  rate,  and  electrocardiogram  parameters  must  be  reported  as  AESI  if  they  occur  within reasonable propinquity of Lutathera and/or amino acid administration in the judgment of the Investigator. Likewise, clinically manifest and/or consequences of hypo-/hypertension, arrhythmias,  cardiac  conduction  disturbances,  and  other  cardiac  pathologies  evidenced  by objective  findings  /  changes  on  electrocardiogram  or  echocardiography  should  also  be considered for AESI reporting. In addition, any clinically significant event of hyperkalemia or hypokalemia must be reported as AESI.

## 10.1.6 SAE reporting

To ensure subject safety,  every  SAE,  regardless  of  causality,  occurring  after  the  subject  has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study treatment must be  reported  to  AAA  pharmacovigilance  immediately,  without  undue  delay  and  under  no circumstances later than 24 hours following knowledge of its occurrence. Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site.

All follow-up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial  SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow-up to the original episode immediately, without undue delay and under no circumstances later than within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow-up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or  otherwise  considered  completely  unrelated  to  a  previously  reported  one  must  be  reported separately as a new event.

Information about all AE/SAEs is collected and recorded on the SAE Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator  must  assess  and  record  the  relationship  of  each  AE/SAE  to  each  specific  study treatment (if there is more than one study treatment), complete the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form under no circumstances later than 24 hours following knowledge to AAA pharmacovigilance.

Follow-up  information  is  submitted  in  the  same  way  as  the  original  AE/SAE  Report.  Each reoccurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as a followup to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation.

If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator's Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence)  and  is  thought  to  be  related  to  the  study  treatment,  AAA  pharmacovigilance associate may urgently require further information from  the investigator for health  authority

Confidential reporting. AAA may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported.

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the  competent  authorities  and  relevant  ethics  committees  in  accordance  with  EU  Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.

Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day period should only be reported to AAA Safety if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment, except for secondary hematological malignancies which need to be reported irrespective of causality.

## 10.1.7 Pregnancy reporting

To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent form must be reported to Advanced Accelerator Applications within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.

Pregnancy should be recorded and reported by the investigator to the AAA Pharmacovigilance. Pregnancy follow-up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the  possible  relationship  to  the  study  treatment  and  any  pregnancy  outcome.  Any  SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported.

## 10.1.8 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse

Not applicable.

## 10.1.9 Annual Safety Report

For more information on AE and SAE definition and reporting requirements, please see the respective sections.

Once per year, the sponsor or PI will supply a report on the safety of trial patients  with  all available  relevant  information  concerning  patient  safety  during  the  reference  period  to  the Competent Authorities of all Countries where the trial is being conducted. This report will also be supplied to the responsible ethics committee.

The annual safety report will be compiled according to the corresponding ICH guideline E2F

'Development Safety Update Report -DSUR'.

The data lock point for the patient data to be included and analyzed should be the last day of the one-year reporting period calculated from The Development International Birth Date (DIBD).

The sponsor will submit the report within 60 calendar days after the reference date (data-lock point).

Confidential

## 10.2 Additional Safety Monitoring

Lutathera safety profile is well documented during Erasmus and NETTER-1 clinical trials as well as during post marketing surveillance, therefore additional data monitoring will not be used for this study. Safety data will be reviewed on regular basis by both clinical and pharmacovigilance departments.

## 10.2.1 Steering Committee

The steering committee will be established comprising investigators participating in the trial and Advanced Accelerator Applications representatives from the Clinical Trial Team.

The  SC  will  ensure  transparent  management  of  the  study  according  to  the  protocol  through recommending  and  approving  modifications  as  circumstances  require.  The  SC  will  review protocol  amendments  as  appropriate.  Together  with  the  clinical  trial  team,  the  SC  will  also develop  recommendations  for  publications  of  study  results  including  authorship  rules.  The details  of  the  membership  and  role  of  the  Steering  Committee  will  be  defined  in  a  Steering Committee charter.

Confidential

## 11 Data Collection and Database management

## 11.1 Data collection

The designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF). The eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web enabled software that conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. Investigator site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the entered data by the investigator staff.

The  Principal  investigator  is  responsible  for  assuring  that  the  data  (recorded  on  eCRFs)  is complete, accurate and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner.

The Investigator must certify that the data entered are complete and accurate. After final database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the subject data for archiving at the investigational site.

All  data  should  be  recorded,  handled  and  stored  in  a  way  that  allows  its  accurate  reporting, interpretation and verification.

## 11.2 Database management and quality control

Advanced Accelerator Applications personnel (or designated CRO) will review the data entered by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy. Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and  sent  to  the  investigational  site  via  the  EDC  system.  Designated  investigator  site  staff  is required to respond promptly to queries and to make any necessary changes to the data.

Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Medical history/current medical conditions and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology.

Data about all study treatment (s) dispensed to the subject and all dosage changes will be tracked on the study drug accountability logs. An electronic system for the Drug Supply Management might be implemented for this trial. The local monitor will provide training material to order the study drugs during the initiation visit. Once all the necessary actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreement by Advanced Accelerator Applications development management.

After database lock, the investigator will receive a CD-ROM or paper copies of the subject data for archiving at the investigational site.

## 11.3 Site monitoring

Before study initiation, at a site initiation  visit or  at  an  investigator's  meeting,  an  Advanced Accelerator Applications representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (eCRFs)  with  the  investigators  and  their  staff.  During  the  study,  Advanced  Accelerator

Confidential

Applications  employs  several  methods  of  ensuring  protocol  and  GCP  compliance  and  the quality/integrity of the sites' data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site's  data  may  be  performed  by  Advanced  Accelerator  Applications. Additionally,  a  central analytics organization may analyze data &amp; identify risks &amp; trends for site operational parameters, and  provide  reports  to  Advanced  Accelerator  Applications  clinical  teams  to  assist  with  trial oversight.

The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study, consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms,  and  the results of any  other tests or assessments.  All  information  on  eCRFs  must  be  traceable  to  these  source  documents  in  the Subject's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by the subject (a signed copy is given to the subject).

The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency  with  the  data  capture  and/or  data  entry.  Advanced  Accelerator  Applications monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are performed according to the study-specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed.

Confidential

## 12 Data analysis and statistical methods

The primary efficacy and safety analyses will be performed after observing approximately 99 PFS events per central assessment. The primary CSR will be produced after the primary PFS analysis.  The key secondary endpoints will be tested hierarchically at the time of the primary PFS analysis. Any additional data for participants continuing to receive study treatment past this time and for participants continuing for efficacy follow-up (PFS, OS) and quality of life followup, as allowed by the protocol, will be further summarized at the time of the final analysis.  A final report to support the final analysis will be planned after End of Study (EOS).

Advanced Accelerator Applications and/or a designated contract research organization (CRO) will perform all analysis.

Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator should be submitted to Advanced Accelerator Applications before publication or presentation.

## 12.1 Analysis sets

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprises all subjects to whom study treatment has been assigned by randomization. According to the intent to treat principle, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment and strata they have been assigned to during the randomization procedure.

The Safety Set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment. Patients will be analyzed according to the study treatment received, where treatment received is defined as the randomized treatment if the subject took at least one dose of that treatment or the first treatment received if the randomized/assigned treatment was never received.

The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS) consists of all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post dosing evaluable PK assessment.

The  cross-over  set  is  comprised  of  all  patients  randomized  to  the  Sandostatin  LAR  Depot (octreotide  long-acting)  arm  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  Lutathera  after  cross-over following confirmed disease progression per central, blinded, real-time images reading in the randomized period.

The re-treatment set is comprised of all patients randomized to the Lutathera arm who received at least one dose of Lutathera during re-treatment period after confirmed disease progression per central, blinded, real-time images reading in the randomized period.

## 12.2 Subject demographics and other baseline characteristics

Demographic  and  other  baseline  data  including  disease  characteristics  will  be  listed  and summarized descriptively by treatment group for the FAS and Safety set.

Categorical data will be presented as frequencies and percentages. For continuous data, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be presented. For selected parameters, 25th and 75th percentiles will also be presented.

Relevant  medical  history  and  current  medical  conditions  at  baseline  will  be  summarized separately by system organ class and preferred term, by treatment group.

Confidential

## 12.3 Treatments

The Safety set will be used for the analyses below. Categorical data will be summarized as frequencies and percentages. For continuous data, mean, standard deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum, and maximum will be presented.

The duration of exposure in months to Lutathera plus Standard Dose octreotide long-acting (30 mg), and, High Dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg) as well as the dose intensity (computed as the ratio of actual cumulative dose received and actual duration of exposure) and the relative dose  intensity  (computed  as  the  ratio  of  dose  intensity  and  planned  dose  intensity)  will  be summarized by means of descriptive statistics using the safety set.

Concomitant medications and significant non-drug therapies prior to and after the start of the study  treatment  will  be  listed  and  summarized  according  to  the  Anatomical  Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system, by treatment group.

The  number  of  subjects  with  dose  adjustments  (reductions,  interruption,  or  permanent discontinuation) and the reasons will be summarized by treatment group and all dosing data will be listed.

## 12.4 Analysis of the primary endpoint(s)

The primary aim of the study is to demonstrate a prolongation of Progression Free Survival (PFS) time (centrally assessed according to RECIST 1.1).

## 12.4.1 Definition of primary endpoint(s)

The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be assessed via central review according to RECIST 1.1. Censoring conventions are provided in Section 12.4.3.

## 12.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analysis

Assuming proportional hazards model for PFS, the null hypothesis will be tested at one-sided 2.5% level of significance:

H01 (null hypotheses): Θ 1 ≥ 0 vs. Ha1 (alternative hypotheses): Θ 1 &lt; 0

Where Θ 1 is the log hazard ratio of PFS in the Lutathera plus Standard Dose octreotide longacting (30 mg) (investigational) arm vs. High Dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg) (control) arm.

The primary efficacy analysis to test this hypothesis and compare the two treatment groups will consist of a stratified log-rank test at an overall one-sided 2.5% level of significance in favor of the Lutathera plus Standard Dose octreotide long-acting (30 mg) arm. The stratification will be based on following randomization stratification factors (grade: G2 vs. G3; and tumor origin: pNET vs other origin).

Analyses will be based on the FAS population according to the randomized treatment group and strata assigned at randomization. The PFS distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and  Kaplan-Meier  curves,  median  and  associated  95%  confidence  intervals  will  be

Confidential presented for each treatment group. The hazard ratio for PFS will be calculated, along with its 95% confidence interval, from a stratified Cox model using the same stratification factors as for the log-rank test.

In  case  of  few  events  in  some  stratum,  the  primary  analysis  will  instead  be  unstratified  (the precise handling of strata will be described in the SAP). Both stratified and unstratified analyses will be presented.

## 12.4.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations

In  cases  of  incomplete  data  to  determine  the  exact  time  of  tumor  progression  or  death,  the principle for imputation is to be conservative. The following rules can be used to determine the event/censoring date as well as the status of event or censoring at the time of the analysis of the primary end-point PFS depending on data pattern:

In the primary analysis, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment if no PFS event is observed prior to the analysis cut-off date. The censoring rules will be detailed in the SAP.

For sensitivity analyses, see next Section 12.4.4.

## 12.4.4 Sensitivity and Supportive analyses

## Sensitivity analyses

A  sensitivity  analysis  will  assess  PFS  events  if  a  patient  has  disease  progression  or  death regardless  of  whether  the  patient  had  missing  scheduled  visits,  treatment  discontinuation  for toxicity, or new anticancer treatment started without progression.

As sensitivity analyses performed in the FAS, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for PFS per blinded independent central review will be obtained from an unstratified and covariate unadjusted Cox model, except when the primary analysis is unstratified, see Section 12.4.2.

Further sensitivity analyses will be specified in the SAP.

## Supportive analyses

As a supportive analysis, PFS as per local assessment will be analyzed using a stratified Cox model, with the same analysis conventions as the primary efficacy analysis, and the treatment effect will be summarized by the hazard ratio with its 95% confidence interval. Kaplan-Meier curves,  medians  and  95%  confidence  intervals  of  the  medians  will  be  presented  for  each treatment group.

As supportive analyses performed in the FAS, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for PFS per blinded independent central review will be obtained from:

- A stratified and covariate adjusted Cox model including as covariates the following: ALP, Time since Diagnosis, Time since Metastasis. The final list of covariates to be included in the model will be provided in the SAP.

Confidential

- Further supportive analyses will be specified in the SAP

These analyses will include Kaplan-Meier medians with their 95% confidence intervals, and hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals from stratified Cox models.

If the primary analysis is statistically significant, subgroup analyses to assess the homogeneity of  the  treatment  effect  across  demographic  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  will  be performed. The subgroups will include the stratification factors (Grade and Site), Age, Gender, Race, Karnofsky score, Tumor burden at baseline, BMI. The subgroups will be further detailed in the SAP.

The number of subjects censored and reasons for censoring will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics, presented separately for local review and blinded independent central review.

## 12.5 Analysis of secondary endpoints

The key secondary objectives in this study are to compare the two treatment groups with respect to:

- ­ ORR: rate of patients with best overall response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) (centrally assessed according to RECIST 1.1).
- ­ Time to deterioration defined as the first deterioration of 10 points (TTD) defined for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-G.I.NET21 global health scale, diarrhea, fatigue, and pain.

Other secondary objectives of the study are to compare the two treatment groups with respect to:

- ­ DOR: Duration  of  Response  defined  as  time  from  complete  or  partial  response  to progression or death due to underlying cancer only.
- ­ Rate of adverse events and laboratory toxicities (scored according to CTCAE grade).
- ­ OS: time from the randomization date until the day of death due to any cause.

## 12.5.1 Key secondary objectives

If the primary endpoint is significant, the key secondary endpoints of overall response rate (ORR) and QoL will be tested in a hierarchical fashion to protect the type I error rate.  The order of the hypothesis  testing  shall  be  ORR  followed  by  QoL  Global  Health  Scale  (TTD,  see  below), followed by QoL Diarrhea (TTD), (TTD)-fatigue, and, (TTD)-pain (TTD).  The key secondary objectives  will  be  tested  at  the  time  of  the  primary  analysis.  At  the  final  analysis,  only  a descriptive analysis will be performed.

Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of subjects with best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), as per central review and according to RECIST 1.1.

ORR will be calculated based on the FAS and according to the ITT principle. ORR and its 95% confidence interval will be presented by treatment group. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chisquare test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors, will be used to compare ORR

Confidential between the two treatment groups, at the 1-sided 2.5% level of significance. As a supportive analysis,  ORR  as  per  local  review  will  be  presented  by  treatment  group,  along  with  95% confidence intervals.

Time to deterioration (TTD) is defined as time from randomization to the first deterioration of 10 points in domain score compared to the baseline score for the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health scale, diarrhea, fatigue, and pain assessments. The TTD distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Kaplan-Meier curves, medians and 95% confidence intervals of the medians will be presented for each treatment group. Treatment effect will be tested by the stratified  log-rank  test.  The  hazard  ratio  for  TTD  will  be  calculated,  along  with  its  95% confidence interval, using a stratified Cox model using stratified the randomization stratification factors. Patients with no baseline and/or no follow-up are censored at randomization. Diarrhea, fatigue  and  pain  are  considered  clinically  relevant  (Strosberg,  et  al.,  2018),  identified  as  top symptoms in a patient survey (Singh, et al., 2018) and TTD associated with these symptoms domains was significant in a post-hoc analysis of NETTER-1.

Further  details  regarding  the  planned  sensitivity  and  supplementary  analyses  for  the  key secondary endpoints will be provided in the SAP.

## 12.5.2 Other efficacy endpoints

Disease Control Rate (DCR) is defined as rate of patients with best overall response of partial response (PR), complete response (CR), or stable disease (SD) (centrally assessed according to RECIST 1.1). More precisely, it counts the presence of at least one confirmed CR or confirmed PR or SD. The DCR will be calculated based on FAS according to the ITT principle. DCR and its  95%  confidence  interval  will  be  presented  by  treatment  group.  The  Cochrane-MantelHaenszel chi-square test, stratified by the randomization stratification factors, will be used to compare DCR between the two treatment groups, at the one-sided 2.5% level of significance. The p-value to be generated using the Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test is considered nominal, and not to be considered confirmatory as it is not part of the testing strategy. The SAP will advise on how to proceed in case of few events in any stratum.

Duration of response (DOR) only applies to subjects whose best overall response is complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 based on tumor response data per local review. The start date is the date of first documented response of CR or PR (i.e., the start date of response, not the date when response was confirmed), and the end date is defined as the date of the first documented progression per local review or death due to underlying cancer. Subjects continuing without progression or death due to underlying cancer will be censored at the date of their last adequate tumor assessment. DOR will be listed and summarized by treatment group for all subjects in the FAS with confirmed BOR of CR or PR.

OS is defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. If a subject is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the latest date the subject was known to be alive (on or before the cut-off date).

OS will be analyzed in the FAS population according to the randomized treatment group and strata assigned at randomization. At the time of the PFS primary analysis, the OS distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Kaplan-Meier curves, medians and

Confidential

95% confidence intervals of the medians will be presented for each treatment group. The hazard ratio for OS will be calculated, along with its 95% confidence interval, using a stratified Cox model.

At  the  final  analysis  time,  a  supportive  analysis  will  adjust  for  cross-over  from  Control  to Lutathera. This will be achieved by using a rank-preserving structural failure time method (RPSFT) to  correct  for  confounding  introduced  by  the  change  of  treatment.  The  use  of  the RPSFT method allows survival time estimates gained by anyone receiving Lutathera (i.e. either as randomized to Lutathera or after cross-over from Control to Lutathera). The RPSFT model is based  on  an  accelerated  failure  time  model)  and  uses  a  structural  assumption  of  timeproportionality  instead  of  a  proportional  hazards  assumption  as  used  in  the  Cox  model.  The widely used Cox model measures drug effect on the hazard ratio scale, whereas the accelerated failure time model measures drug effect on the survival time ratio scale.

Additionally, a supportive analysis of OS based on the Inverse Probability Censoring Weight method will be performed at the final analysis time. Further details regarding theses analyses will be given in the SAP.

## 12.5.3 Safety endpoints

For all safety analyses, the safety set will be used. All listings and tables will be presented by treatment group.

The frequency of adverse events and laboratory toxicities (scored according to CTCAE 5.0 grade or current version) will be presented.

All adverse events (AEs), whether or not spontaneously reported by the patient, will be recorded starting from the signing of the ICF until the end of the Treatment Phase.

Safety  summaries  (tables,  figures)  include  only  data  from  the  on-treatment  period  with  the exception of baseline data which will also be summarized where appropriate (e.g. change from baseline summaries). In addition, a separate summary for death including on treatment and post treatment deaths will be provided. In particular, summary tables for adverse events (AEs) will summarize only on-treatment events, with a start date during the on-treatment period ( treatmentemergent AEs).

The on-treatment period lasts from the date of first administration of study treatment to 30 days after the date of the last actual administration of any study treatment.

The overall observation period will be divided into three mutually exclusive segments:

- pre-treatment period: from day of subject's informed consent to the day before first dose of study medication
- on-treatment period: from day of first dose of study medication to 30 days after last dose of study medication
- post-treatment period: starting at day 30+1 after last dose of study medication.
- There will be a dedicated presentation of safety for patients who cross-over.

Confidential

## Adverse events

All information obtained on adverse events will be displayed by treatment group and subject.

The number (and percentage) of subjects with treatment emergent adverse events (events started after the first dose of study medication or events present prior to start of double-blind treatment but increased in severity based on preferred term) will be summarized in the following ways:

1. by treatment, primary system organ class and preferred term.
2. by treatment, primary system organ class, preferred term and maximum severity.
3. by treatment, Standardized MedDRA Query (SMQ) and preferred term

Separate summaries will be provided for study medication related adverse events, death, serious adverse events, other significant adverse events leading to discontinuation and adverse events leading to dose adjustment.

The number (and proportion) of subjects with AESI/related to identified and potential risks (see Section 10.1) will be summarized by treatment.

A subject with multiple adverse events within a primary system organ class is only counted once towards the total of the primary system organ class.

## Vital signs

All vital signs data will be listed by treatment group, subject, and visit/time and if ranges are available, abnormalities (and relevant orthostatic changes) will be flagged. Summary statistics will be provided by treatment and visit/time.

## 12-lead ECG

PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, and RR intervals will be obtained from 12-lead ECGs for each subject during the study. ECG data will be read and interpreted (centrally/locally).

All ECG data will be listed by treatment group, subject and visit/time, abnormalities will be flagged. Summary statistics will be provided by treatment and visit/time.

## Clinical laboratory evaluations

All laboratory data will be listed by treatment group, subject, and visit/time and if normal ranges are available abnormalities will be flagged. Summary statistics will be provided by treatment and visit/time. Shift tables using the low/normal/high/ (low and high) classification will be used to compare baseline to the worst on-treatment value.

Grading  of  laboratory  values  will  be  assigned  programmatically  as  per  NCI  Common Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  5.0  or  current  version . The calculation of  CTCAE grades will be based on the observed laboratory values only, clinical assessments will not be taken into account.

CTCAE Grade 0 will be assigned for all non-missing values not graded as 1 or higher. Grade 5 will not be used.

Confidential

For laboratory tests where grades are not defined by CTCAE, results will be categorized as low/normal/high based on laboratory normal ranges.

The following summaries will be generated separately for hematology, and biochemistry tests:

1. Listing of all laboratory data with values flagged to show the corresponding CTCAE grades if applicable and the classifications relative to the laboratory normal ranges
2. For laboratory tests where grades are defined by CTCAE,
3. Worst post-baseline CTCAE grade (regardless of the baseline status). Each subject will be counted only once for the worst grade observed post-baseline.
4. Shift tables using CTCAE grades to compare baseline to the worst on-treatment value
5. For laboratory tests where grades are not defined by CTCAE,
6. Shift tables using the low/normal/high/ (low and high) classification to compare baseline to the worst on-treatment value.

CgA assessment is discontinued in Q3 2022 in South Korea due to lab kits shortage (assessments performed before discontinuation will be included in the analyses).

## 12.6 Analysis of exploratory endpoints

## 12.6.1 PFS2

PFS2 is defined as time from date of randomization to the first documented local progression on next-line  therapy  or  death  from  any  cause,  whichever  occurs  first.  The  first  documented progression on next-line treatment is based on investigator assessment of PD (i.e. as captured on the anti-neoplastic therapy after treatment discontinuation eCRF page); it is not necessary to continue  to  collect  tumor  assessments  data  for  subsequent  anti-neoplastic  therapies  for  the purpose of PFS2.

- Next-line therapy is defined as the first new (systemic) anti-neoplastic therapy initiated after discontinuation of study treatment regardless of EoT reason. Drugs given as part of the same regimen should be considered as first line (i.e. part of the next-line therapy).
- New anti-neoplastic therapies after EoT will be collected in the anti-neoplastic therapy after treatment discontinuation eCRF page including start/end date, reason for discontinuation, date and type of progression («clinical» vs «radiologic»).
- PFS2 will be censored if no PFS2 event (progression or death) is observed during next-line therapy before the analysis cut-off date; the censoring date will be the last contact date.
- However, in case a second new anti-neoplastic therapy is introduced without prior PFS2 event, then PFS2 will be censored at the end date of the first new anti-neoplastic therapy (i.e. next line therapy).
- Any death prior to initiation of next-line therapy will be considered as an event for PFS2. Any death occurring following end of next line therapy will be considered as an event if no second new anti-neoplastic therapy has been introduced.

Confidential

- PFS and PFS2 may be identical if a subject did not experience an event (i.e. progression) prior  to  initiation  of  next-line  therapy,  and  adequate  tumor  assessments  continue  until RECIST 1.1-documented disease progression after initiation of next-line therapy.

PFS2 will be analyzed in the FAS population according to the randomized treatment group and strata assigned at randomization. The PFS2 distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Kaplan-Meier curves, medians and 95% confidence intervals of the medians will be presented for each treatment group. The hazard ratio for PFS2 will be calculated, along with its 95% confidence interval, using a stratified Cox model.

Time to Second Progression (PFS2) in the two treatment arms will be evaluated as a secondary endpoint. This endpoint is defined as the time in months from the first progression to the second progression  or  death.  The  date  of  both  the  first  and  second  progression  will  be  derived programmatically through the RECIST criteria.

It is recognized that due to cross-over, the lower scan frequency (every six months) after PEP, and, the relatively short follow-up, the possibility to draw firm conclusions is limited.

## 12.6.2 Patient reported outcomes not associated with key secondary endpoint

TTD for items/scales derived from EORTC QLQ-G.I.NET21 and EORTC QLQ-30 not included among  the  key  secondary  endpoints  will  be  analyzed  as  exploratory  endpoints.  The  TTD distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Kaplan-Meier curves, medians and 95% confidence intervals of the medians will be presented for each treatment group. The hazard ratio for TTD will be calculated, along with its 95% confidence interval, using a stratified Cox model.

Quality  of  Life  will  also  be  assessed  in  terms  of  change  from  baseline  in  EORTC  QLQG.I.NET21,  EORTC  QLQ-C30  and  EQ-5D-5L  through  Mixed  Model  Repeated  Measures (MMRM), which  deals  with  missing  values  in  a  model  based  way,  and  implicitly  imputes missing data under a missing at random assumption. The model will include the explanatory variables Treatment, Baseline, Week, and, the interaction between Treatment and Week. A test of treatment effect is performed at each week, and, overall.

## 12.6.3 Pharmacokinetics

Patients  in  the  control  arm  (all  countries  except  for  China)  will  yield  PK  data  from  blood sampling performed at pre-dose with respect to the octreotide long-acting i.m. injection for the 2nd, 4th,  5th  and  7th  treatment  cycle  (that  is  respectively  at  week  4,  12,  16  and  24)  for  the determination of plasma trough levels. Data will be processed using a population based model, for exploratory purposes. More details on the presentation of results will be given in the SAP.

Additionally,  descriptive  statistics  and  graphical  display  of  octreotide  plasma  concentrations during  the  course  of  treatment  will  presented  by  dose  group.  Exploratory  analysis  will  be performed to assess the dose-exposure relationship. More details on the presentation of results will be given in the SAP.

Confidential

## 12.6.4 Re-treatment with Lutathera

Safety will be presented in a similar manner to that in Section 12.5.3 for those participants who receive re-treatment with Lutathera during the re-treatment period. The re-treatment period lasts from the date of first administration of re-treatment with Lutathera to progression or death during the re-treatment period.

All information obtained on adverse events will be displayed by subject.

All vital signs data will be listed subject, and visit/time and if ranges are available, abnormalities (and  relevant  orthostatic  changes)  will  be  flagged.  Summary  statistics  will  be  provided  by visit/time.

All ECG data (as per local assessment) will be listed by subject and visit/time, abnormalities will be flagged. Summary statistics will be provided by visit/time.

All laboratory data will be listed by subject, and visit/time and if normal ranges are available abnormalities will be flagged. Summary statistics will be provided by visit/time. Shift tables using  the  low/normal/high/  (low  and  high)  classification  will  be  used  to  compare  the  latest assessment before re-treatment to the worst re-treatment value.

All efficacy analyses for ORR, DoR, PFS, PFS2, and OS will be descriptive.  Definitions for ORR, DoR, and PFS (as per local assessment) are the same definitions in Section 12.5.2 except that the baseline will be based on the tumor assessment which demonstrated progression thus allowing  re-treatment  with  Lutathera.  Definitions  for  OS  and  PFS2  are  the  same  to  that  in Section 12.5.2 and Section 12.6.1, respectively.

## 12.7 Interim analyses

An interim analysis with respect to OS will be performed at the time of the PFS final analysis. At this time point, only estimation of treatment effect will be performed (hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval).

## 12.8 Sample size calculation

## 12.8.1 Primary endpoint(s)

The sample size calculation is based on the primary variable PFS. Assuming a median PFS in the control arm (High Dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg)) of approximately 15 months, it is hypothesized that treatment with Lutathera added to standard dose octreotide long-acting will result in a 50% reduction in the hazard rate (corresponding to an increase in median PFS from 15 months to 30 months).

To  ensure  90%  power  to  test  the  null  hypothesis:  PFS  hazard  ratio  =  1,  versus  the  specific alternative hypothesis: PFS hazard ratio = 0.50, it is calculated that a total of 99 PFS events need to be observed. This calculation assumes analysis by a one-sided log-rank test at the overall 2.5% level of significance, patients randomized to the two treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio. Assuming that enrolment will continue for approximately 22.2 months at a rate of 10 patients per month and a 15% dropout rate by the time of the final PFS analysis, a total of 222 patients (148 for Lutathera arm and 74 for the control arm) will need to be randomized to observe the targeted 99

Confidential

Protocol No. CAAA601A22301

PFS events at about 12.8 months after the randomization date of the last patient, i.e., 35 months after  the  randomization  date  of  the  first  patient.  If  the  final  analysis  is  performed  when  the targeted 99 PFS events are observed, the observed hazard ratio will have to be &lt; 0.658 which corresponds to a difference in median PFS of 7.8 months to declare statistical significance.

These calculations were made using the software package East 6.4.

Randomization will be stratified by Grade (G2 vs G3) and tumor origin (pNET vs other origin).

## 13 Ethical considerations and administrative procedures

## 13.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance

This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented, executed and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable local regulations  (including  European  Directive  2001/20/EC,  US  CFR  21),  and  with  the  ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.

## 13.2 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC

Before initiating a trial, the investigator/institution must obtain approval/favorable opinion from the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) for the trial protocol, written  informed  consent  form,  consent  form  updates,  subject  recruitment  procedures  (e.g., advertisements) and any other written information to be provided to subjects. Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to Advanced Accelerator Applications monitors, auditors, Advanced  Accelerator Applications Quality Assurance representatives,  designated  agents  of  Advanced  Accelerator  Applications,  IRBs/IECs,  and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authority, the investigator must inform Advanced Accelerator Applications immediately that this request has been made.

## 13.3 Publication of study protocol and results

The protocol will be registered in a publicly accessible database such as clinicaltrials.gov and as required in EudraCT. In addition, after study completion (defined as last patient last visit) and finalization of the study report the results of this trial will be submitted for publication and posted in  a  publicly  accessible  database  of  clinical  trial  results,  such  as  the  Advanced  Accelerator Applications  clinical  trial  results  website  and  all  required  Health  Authority  websites  (e.g. Clinicaltrials.gov, EudraCT etc.).

Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) follows the ICMJE authorship guidelines (www.icmje.org). Authors (including Sponsor associates who may qualify for authorship), must therefore satisfy all of the following ICMJE authorship criteria:

1. Substantial contributions to conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
2. Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND
3. Final approval of the version to be published; AND
4. Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

Confidential

The key principles that will be followed for AAA-sponsored, research-related publications are:

- AAA supports  the  publication  of  study  results  for  its  innovative  medicines  in  a  timely manner,  whatever  their  outcome.  AAA  policy  is  not  to  withhold,  veto  or  suppress  data. However, due consideration must be given to the rights of AAA to protect confidential and/or patentable information, and to the protection of personal information, in particular patient privacy.
- Review by AAA  of draft publications by clinical investigators in advance of submission/presentation of publication is designed to:
- -Confirm the accuracy of the data
- -Verify that proprietary information is not being inadvertently disclosed
- -Secure intellectual property rights, as needed
- -Provide any relevant supplementary information
- Publication of partial data (unless planned in the protocol) is discouraged. As a matter of scientific rigor and fairness to all investigators involved in a clinical study, and in accordance with the Joint Position on the Publication of Clinical Trial Results in the Scientific Literature, issued by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA),  European  Federation  of  Pharmaceutical  Industries  and  Associations  (EFPIA), Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA), and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), it is AAA policy for multicenter clinical studies that:
- The first publication in a journal, or a presentation at a congress, be based on consolidated data from all centers, analyzed as stipulated by the protocol and agreed upon by investigators before trial initiation.
- Multicenter  trials  are  designed  to  take  full  account  of  data  accumulated  from  all  centers (sample sized, powered with appropriate error rates), and AAA discourages presenting or publishing data gathered from a single, or small group of centers, unless agreed to by study investigators  (e.g.,  Study  Steering  Committee)  and  AAA.  Center  specific  analyses  have greater variability and lead to exaggerated observed-treatment effects that are inherently less reliable. Valid conclusions regarding the primary endpoint of a clinical trial can only be based on the analyses predefined by the protocol.
- Study results should be published according to the contracted protocol agreements.

## 14 Protocol adherence

This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on study  participants.  Additional  assessments  required  to  ensure  safety  of  subjects  should  be administered as deemed necessary on a case-by-case basis. Under no circumstances including incidental  collection  is  an  investigator  allowed  to  collect  additional  data  or  conduct  any additional procedures for any purpose involving any investigational drugs under the protocol, other than the purpose of the study. If despite this interdiction prohibition, data, information, observation would be incidentally collected, the investigator  shall immediately  disclose  it  to Advanced Accelerator Applications and not use it for any purpose other than the study, except for the appropriate monitoring on study participants.

Investigators  ascertain  they  will  apply  due  diligence  to  avoid  protocol  deviations.  If  an investigator  feels  a  protocol  deviation  would  improve  the  conduct  of  the  study  this  must  be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by Advanced Accelerator Applications and approved by the IRB/IEC and health authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic during the conduction of this study, in addition to capturing protocol deviations, there is also a need to record details on the relationship of COVID19 to protocol deviations occurring during the COVID-19 time period in a manner that will allow analysis and reporting. In order to capture this information, sites will be queried to provide the relationship based on the below categories. When answering these queries, sites will be required to select the most appropriate relationship from the options below only:

| COVID-19 health status related                       | i.e. patients' infection did lead to this PD                                                |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| COVID-19 situation: Site issue*                      | e.g. site closed, personnel not available                                                   |
| COVID-19 situation: Lockdown / Quarantine of patient | e.g. site is active but patient not allowed to come                                         |
| COVID-19 situation: Patient concern                  | e.g. site is active, patient could come but refused to come / do assessment                 |
| COVID-19 situation: Drug supply issue                | e.g. drug was delivered to home e.g. situation not already covered by the information above |
| PD without COVID relationship                        | e.g. situation was not in any way associated with COVID-19                                  |

*As only one option is possible, if 'Site issue' is one of the relationships to COVID-19 for a PD, this should be reported as the primary relationship to COVID-19 for the PD.

Deviations related to COVID-19 will be documented as applicable and an explanation will be provided in the clinical study report (CSR) that this was attributed to the coronavirus outbreak.

## 14.1 Protocol Amendments

Any change or addition to the protocol can only be made in a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Advanced Accelerator Applications, health authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC prior to implementation.

Only amendments that are required for subject safety may be implemented immediately provided the  health  authorities  are  subsequently  notified  by  protocol  amendment  and  the  reviewing IRB/IEC is notified.

Notwithstanding  the  need  for  approval  of  formal  protocol  amendments,  the  investigator  is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any subject included in this study,  even  if  this  action  represents  a  deviation  from  the  protocol.  In  such  cases,  Advanced Accelerator Applications should be notified of this action and the IRB/IEC at the study site should be informed according to local regulations.

## Appendix 1 - Precautions for Pregnancy

Women who receive Lutathera, including those in cross-over arm and those who are re-treated with Lutathera, should not procreate until seven months after the date of their last treatment with 177 Lu-DOTA 0 Tyr 3 -Octreotate, or until the end of treatment period of the study (due to the CT scans foreseen during the study (every 12±1 weeks)), whichever is longer. Women in the control arm should not procreate until the end of treatment period.

It is noteworthy that β -HCG may be secreted by a small percentage of NETs, such that, in addition to being a pregnancy marker it also is a tumor marker. Consequently, NET female patients with positive β -HCG at baseline can be eligible to enter the study and receive treatment if pregnancy can be excluded by lack of expected doubling of β -HCG. Normally in pregnant subjects β -HCG doubles every 2 days during the first 4 weeks of pregnancy and every 3 ½ days by weeks 6 to 7.

Women of childbearing potential include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilisation (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral ovariectomy) or is not postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhoea &gt;12 consecutive months, and for women on hormone replacement therapy, only with a documented plasma follicle-stimulating hormone level &gt;35 mIU/mL). Even women who are using oral, implanted or injected contraceptive hormones, an IUD, or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicidal) to prevent pregnancy, are practicing true abstinence (see definition below) or where the partner is sterile (e.g. vasectomy, see below) should be considered to be  of  childbearing  potential.  Postmenopausal  women  who  have  fertilised  eggs  implanted  are  also considered to be of childbearing potential.

Highly effective methods of contraception must be used throughout the study and for 6 months after study drug discontinuation. Highly effective contraception methods include:

- True abstinence must be in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence  (e.g.,  calendar,  ovulation,  symptothermal,  post-ovulation  methods),  declaration  of abstinence  for  the  duration  of  exposure  to  IMP,  and  withdrawal  are  not  acceptable  methods  of contraception.
- Male or female sterilization  (vasectomized  partner  is  a  highly  effective  birth  control  method provided  that  partner  is  the  sole  sexual  partner  of  the  trial  participant  and  that  the  vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success).
- Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):
- a. Use of oral, injected, or implanted hormonal methods of contraception. In case of use of oral contraception, women should be stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.
- b. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)
- c. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository. Post-menopausal women are allowed to participate in this study. Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) confirmed by a high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level, or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks prior to screening. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

Sexually active males in the Lutathera arm must:

- remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or be willing to use condoms and highly effective methods of contraception with female partners of childbearing potential or pregnant female partners  (see  above)  during  the  treatment  period  and  for  at  least  4  months  after  the  last  dose  of Lutathera (including cross-over and re-treatment, if applicable). Men should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.
- refrain from donating sperm during this same period.

177 Lu is generally produced using enriched 176 Lu placed in a reactor, following a reaction of the type [ 176 Lu n, γ 177 Lu]. This reaction results the production of a small amount of 177 Lu meta-stable ( 177m Lu) which varies according to sources between 10 -5 and 4 × 10 -4 per MBq of 177 Lu produced. The characteristics of this radionuclide are given in Table 2.

## · Recommendations

Based on radiation  exposure  calculations  employing  whole  body  clearance  data  (Wehrmann  C  et  al, 2007)  and  exposure  rates  at  one  meter  at  24  h  (7.5  ±  3.6  µSv/h,  Dpt.  of  Nucl.  Med.  Erasmus  MC Rotterdam), patients may be treated on an outpatient basis for an administration of 7.4 GBq of 177 LuDOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate. As a precaution, it is recommended that patients be kept in radiation isolation for a period of 4 - 5 hours following administration, and be allowed to urinate during that time, and before release.  This  precaution  is  deemed  prudent  because  this  is  the  route  of  Lutathera  elimination (approximately 50% of Lutathera eliminated by urination within the first 6 hours; Kwekkeboom et al, 2001). At the time of release, the patient is given written instructions which summarize the precautions to take, in order to keep the exposure to others below regulatory limits.

## Appendix 5 - Recommendations for Patients Treated with Lutathera

In accordance with the medical staff, you have agreed to receive a treatment using a radioactive medicine. We think that the potential activity of this medicine in treating your tumor is due to the radioactivity of this medicine; it is also for this reason that it is necessary to follow certain precautions in order to limit the exposure of the people around you and to avoid contaminating them with radioactivity.

Because of knowledge and experience in the field, it is estimated that the health risks to your family members and the general public are low because of the physical and radiopharmaceutical properties and the metabolism of the radiopharmaceutical. You must adhere to the following rules to maximize the safety of other persons. They are the result of many years of experience in the use of radioactivity in medicine, and they include recommendations by international organizations.

## 1General rule

You should limit close contact with people who live with you by keeping a distance of at least one meter for 7-days after you receive Lutathera.

## 2Use of toilets

Toilets must be used in a seated position, even for men. It is absolutely necessary to use toilet paper each time. It is equally important to wash your hands to avoid contaminating the door handles. It is strongly recommended to have bowel movements every day and to use a laxative if you need help. Furthermore, empty your bladder (urinate) every hour or so on the day you received treatment and for day after. Follow your doctor's advice on how much fluid to drink. Furthermore, after you receive treatment, empty your bladder (urinate) every hour on the day of treatment and for two more days after treatment. After expelling fluids, drink a glass of water. You can substitute juice or a sports drink as a means to replace expelled fluids. Follow any additional advice that your doctor provides on how much to drink.

## 3Contact with children (less than 10 years old)

After your receive Lutathera, it is strongly recommended that you limit close contact (less than 1 meter) with children to less than 15 minutes per day for 7 days.

## 4Contact with spouse and people in the family circle

You should sleep in a separate bedroom from other people for 7 days after you receive Lutathera. You should sleep in separate bedrooms from children and/or pregnant women for 15 days after you receive Lutathera.

## 5Seniors

Older  people  are  less  sensitive  to  radioactivity  (between  3  and  10  times  less  than  a  middle-aged person). Therefore, the previous recommendations can be followed with a little more flexibility in the presence of the elderly.

## 6Contact with pregnant women

Contact with pregnant women should follow the same restrictions recommended for children less than 10 years old.

Confidential

## 7Breastfeeding

Breastfeeding should be stopped because it is not compatible with a treatment using a radioactive product. If treatment with Lutathera during breast feeding is necessary, the child must be weaned.

## 8Pregnancy

Pregnancy must be excluded before the start of treatment. Any woman who has missed a period must be assumed to be pregnant until proven otherwise and alternative therapies which do not involve ionizing radiation must be then considered.

There is a potential risk that ionizing radiation by Lutathera could cause toxic effects on female and male gonads. Due to the nature of the compound, women who receive Lutathera, including those in cross-over arm and those who are re-treated with Lutathera, should not procreate until seven months after the last Lutathera dose, or until the end of treatment period of the study (due to the CT scans foreseen during the study), whichever is longer. Sexually active males in the Lutathera arm must use condoms and highly effective  methods  of  contraception  with  female  partners  of  childbearing  potential  or  pregnant  female partners during the treatment period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of Lutathera (including cross-over and re-treatment, if applicable). Females of reproductive potential who are partners of male patients should be advised to use highly effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose of Lutathera.

## 9People who need extra assistance

People who are confined to the bed or have reduced mobility will preferably receive assistance by a care provider.  It  is  recommended  that  when  providing  assistance  in  the  bathroom,  the  care  provider  wear disposable gloves for 7 days after administration. In the case of the use of special medical equipment such as catheters, colostomy bags bedpan, water nozzle, or anything that could be contaminated by your body fluids they must be emptied immediately in the toilet and then cleaned. If anyone helps you clean up vomit, blood, urine, or stool they should wear plastic gloves; the gloves should then be put in the specified trash plastic bag.

## 10Dishes and bathroom accessories

For the first two days after your treatment wipes and/or toilet paper must be flushed down the toilet. Always wash your hands well after using the toilet.

It is strongly recommended to shower every day for at least the first 7 days after your treatment.

Try to flush any tissues or any other items that contain anything from your body, such as blood, urine and faeces down the toilet (at least for two days after the therapy). Items that cannot be flushed, such as menstrual pads and bandages, must be placed in specified plastic trash bags.

Wash your underwear, pyjamas, sheets and any clothes that contain sweat, blood or urine separately from the laundry of others in your household. Wash your items two or three times; use a standard washing machine; you do not need to use bleach and do not need extra rinses.

## 11Trash recommendations

Keep the specified plastic trash bags separate from other trash; keep the bags away from children and animals.

A member of the Study Staff will tell you how and when to get rid of the specified plastic trash bag; you may be asked to bring the bag back to your treatment facility, or, after 70 days, the bag may be removed as other trash bags.

## 12Professional activities

Lutathera could affect your ability to drive and to use machines, as dizziness has been reported as a common side effect.

If there is a risk of frequent contact and being in close vicinity to the public and/or with children, the activity must be temporarily suspended.

## 13Use of public transportation

For  short  trips  (less  than  30  minutes),  the  precautions  are  minimum.  If  you  ride  with  someone  else, confirm she is not pregnant, and maintain a distance of &gt;1 meter (use the back seat on opposite side of the driver). If you are able to do so, it is best to drive yourself.

## 14Public activities

Avoid assisting in shows or public meetings which could expose third-parties for more than 30 minutes in the first week after your treatment.

Ask Your Doctor or a member of the Study Staff when:

- ­ It will be safe to eat out, go shopping and attend events such as religious services, parties and movies;
- ­ You will be able to return to work and to care for or teach others;
- ­ It would be safe to donate blood;
- ­ Special  or  longer  distance  travel  is  possible  (Note:  For  up  to  3  months  or  more  following radioactive treatment you may set off radiation detectors at: national borders, airports, bus and train  stations,  tunnels,  bridges,  trash  collection  sites  and  even  your  place  of  employment);  a member of your Study Staff will issue you a letter or card describing the therapy and the phone number of a person knowledgeable about your treatment (usually at the treating facility) in case local law enforcement agents need to check on this information; you should keep the letter or card containing the information with you whenever you are travelling for at least 3 months.

## 15Hospitalization

In the case that an unplanned hospitalization occurs, it is important to notify your doctor.

There is a possibility that due to an excessive release of hormones following the administration of 177 LuDOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate your doctor may request that you stay in hospital overnight for observation and treatment if necessary, normally consists of intravenous fluids, corticosteroids and the correction of any chemical imbalance in the blood.

## 16Domesticated animals

The lifespan  of  domesticated  animals  is  much  less  than  that  of  humans.  Therefore,  the  effect  of  the radioactivity is less. It is not necessary to take any particular precautions. But do not sleep with pets (ask your doctor for how long) since your secretions may be carried away by the pet.

## 17Emergency Care

You will get an information card or letter at the time of your treatment that will show the date, type and amount of radioactivity that you were treated with; carry this card with you at all times for at least 3 months following your treatment.

If you are in a traffic accident or any other medical emergency and require medical assistance during the first week after your treatment, you should show this card to the medical providers to let them know about the date and dose of your radioactive treatment.

## 18Important information for patients on risks of radiation

Confidential

Protocol No. CAAA601A22301

Radiation  exposure  to  others  should  always  be  As  Low  As  Reasonably  Achievable,  a  goal  often abbreviated as ALARA. If you follow the above advice, the radiation from you to others is likely to be less than what they receive from radiation in nature over a year's time.

Please phone us if:

- you have any questions, and particularly if
- any of the above instructions cannot be followed and/or if
- you see  anything  that  may  have  accidentally  or  unavoidably  increased  exposure  of  others  to radiation.

## Special precautions for disposal and other handling

Radiopharmaceuticals  should  be  received,  used  and  administered  only  by  authorized  persons  in designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the competent official organization.

Radiopharmaceuticals  should  be  prepared  in  a  manner  which  satisfies  both  radiation  safety  and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.

If  at  any  time  in  the  preparation  of  this  medicinal  product  the  integrity  of  this  container  and  vial  is compromised it should not be used.

Administration  procedures  should  be  carried  out  in  a  way  to  minimize  risk  of  contamination  of  the medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory.

It is necessary to wear waterproof gloves and suitable aseptic techniques when handling the medicinal product.

The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or contamination from spill of  urine,  vomiting  etc.  Radiation  protection  precautions  in  accordance  with national regulations must therefore be taken.

The surface dose rates and the accumulated dose depend on many factors. Measurements on the location and during work are critical and should be practiced for more precise and instructive determination of overall radiation dose to the staff. Healthcare personnel are advised to limit the time of close contact with patients  injected  with  Lutathera.  The  use  of  television  monitor  systems  to  monitor  the  patients  is recommended. Given the half life of 177Lu it is specially recommended to avoid internal contamination. It  is  necessary  to  use  protective  high  quality  (latex/nitrile)  gloves  to  avoid  direct  contact  with  the radiopharmaceutical (vial/syringe). For minimizing radiation exposure, always use the principles of time, distance and shielding (reducing the manipulation of the vial and using the material already supplied par the manufacturer).

Confidential

This preparation is likely to result in a relatively high radiation dose to most patients. The administration of 7,400 MBq may result in significant environmental hazard.

This may be of concern to the immediate family of those individuals undergoing treatment or the general public depending on the level of activity administered, hence radioprotection rules should be followed. Suitable  precautions  in  accordance  with  national  regulations  should  be  taken  concerning  the  activity eliminated by the patients in order to avoid any contaminations.

Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed according to local requirements.

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE USE OF Lutathera (7400 MBq)

Lutathera is for single use only.

The  solution  should  be  visually  inspected  for  damage  and  contamination  before  use,  and  only  clear solutions  free  of  visible  particles  should  be  used.  The  visual  inspection  of  the  solution  should  be performed under a shielded screen for radioprotection purposes. The vial must not be opened.

If at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of this vial is compromised, it should not be used.

The amount of radioactivity in the vial must be measured prior to infusion using a suitable radioactivity calibration system in order to confirm that the actual amount of radioactivity to be administered is equal to the planned amount at the infusion time.

Any  unused  medicinal  product  or  waste  material  should  be  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  local requirements. The activimeter or dose calibrator must be periodically calibrated by means of a standard source of Lu-177. If this procedure is not in place at the clinical site, Advanced Accelerator Applications will provide a calibration protocol and will ship a source of Lu-177 to perform the calibration if needed.

Lutathera does not need to be manipulated before administration because it is delivered as a ready to use monodose vial.

Lutathera must not be used after the expiry date which is stated on the label of the outer package.

Product receipt, tracking and administration data will be recorded using a informatics system provided by Advanced Accelerator Applications. In the event that the product is not administered for any reason, AAA will be notified, and a disposal verification record will be provided.

## Quality Control of Lutathera

Minimum Quality Control is needed at the site, before the administration of Lutathera. The site will confirm  that  the  product  received  has  the  correct  release  certificate.  The  results  will  be  recorded. Additionally, the site's measurement of total radioactivity and product administration data (start and stop time, and residual radioactivity not administered) will also be recorded.

Confidential

## Lutathera storage requirements

Lutathera must be stored at a temperature below 25°C (77° F), in its original package for radioprotection purposes, according to national regulations concerning radioactive products.

Shelf life: 72 hours after end of production.

## Further information

The clinical site must request the required Lutathera dose for each patient at least 10 days before the scheduled treatment. A product order must be placed with AAA through the informatics system provided to each physician. The administration date of the product for each patient should not be confirmed until the clinical site has received both an order confirmation and a production dose confirmation from AAA. The  scheduled  date  of  treatment  must  be  accepted  by  AAA  so  that  the  Manufacturer's  Production Planning matches patient treatment schedules.

## Appendix 8 - Determination of LUTATHERA Administered Radioactivity

The total amount of radioactivity administered to the patient is determined by measuring the radioactivity present in the LUTATHERA ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate, Infusion Solution) Vial before and after administration. The procedure is as follows:

## A. Measurement of LUTATHERA Vial radioactivity before LUTATHERA administration:

- 1) remove the LUTATHERA Vial from the original package;
- 2) place the LUTATHERA Vial in the dose calibrator (activimeter) chamber;
- 3) select the Lu-177 setting on the dose calibrator;
- 4) press the 'measure' button (or equivalent function button);
- 5) record  the  measured  radioactivity,  and  the  time  of  measurement  in  the  appropriate electronic Case Report Form (eCRF);
- 6) remove the LUTATHERA Vial from the dose calibrator chamber;
- 7) return  the  LUTATHERA Vial to its original package or prepare the Vial for patient administration.

## B. Measurement of LUTATHERA vial radioactivity after LUTATHERA administration:

- 1) remove needles and tubing attached to the LUTATHERA Vial (NB: The investigator must  confirm  that  there  is  no  significant  residual  radioactivity  remaining  in  delivery needles  and  tubing  after  administration  (&lt;  0.1%  of  original  Total  Radioactivity  in LUTATHERA Vial);
- 2) if the dose calibrator is in a different location, place the LUTATHERA Vial in the original package so that the material can be moved safely - otherwise go to step 4;
- 3) remove the LUTATHERA Vial from the original package;
- 4) place the LUTATHERA Vial in the dose calibrator chamber;
- 5) select the Lu-177 setting on the dose calibrator;
- 6) press the 'measure' button (or equivalent function button);
- 7) record the measured radioactivity, and the time of measurement in the appropriate eCRF;
- 8) remove the LUTATHERA Vial from the dose calibrator chamber and dispose according to national and local regulations for disposal of radioactive waste;

## C. Calculation of Total Administered and Residual Radioactivity:

- 1) Total Administered Radioactivity
2. = (amount of radioactivity in LUTATHERA Vial before administration minus amount of radioactivity in LUTATHERA Vial after administration) times vial geometry correction factor
- 2) Residual Radioactivity = amount of radioactivity remaining in LUTATHERA Vial after administration times vial geometry correction factor
- 3) record Total Administered Radioactivity and Residual Radioactivity in the appropriate sections of the patient's eCRF.

## 1 Introduction

CAAA601A22301 (NETTER-2) is a phase III multi-center, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Lutathera in patients with Grade 2 and Grade 3 advanced Gastro-Entero-Pancreatic Neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET).

The  content  of  this  SAP  is  based  on  protocol  CAAA601A22301  (NETTER-2)  version  2.0 released  on  05-OCT-2022.  All  decisions  regarding  the  analysis  of  the  primary  and  key secondary endpoints, as defined in this document, have been made prior to the database lock and unblinding of the study data.

## 1.1 Study design

This is a multicenter, stratified, randomized, open-label comparator-controlled, Phase III study in  patients  ≥15  years  with  somatostatin  receptor  positive,  well -differentiated  G2  and  G3, advanced GEP NETs, diagnosed within 6 months prior to screening.

The study consists of a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, an optional Treatment Extension Phase (cross-over to Lutathera) for patients assigned to high-dose octreotide long-acting, an optional Re-Treatment Phase (re-treatment with Lutathera) for patients assigned to Lutathera plus octreotide long-acting, and a Follow-up Phase as shown in the below figure.

Overall, approximately 222 patients will be randomized (2:1 randomization ratio) to receive treatment with Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 ± 1 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi) plus octreotide long-acting (30 mg every 8 weeks during Lutathera treatment and every 4 weeks after last Lutathera treatment) or high dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg every 4 weeks). Randomization will be stratified by tumor grade (G2 vs G3) and tumor origin (pancreatic NET [pNET] vs other origin).

The primary endpoint of the study is radiological Progression-Free Survival (PFS) centrally assessed. The primary efficacy and safety analysis will be performed after 99 PFS events (99 evaluable and centrally confirmed disease progressions or death events) have occurred. This is expected to occur about 35 months after the first patient was randomized.

At the time of the PFS primary analysis, the key secondary endpoints of Objective Response Rate (ORR), and the Time to Deterioration (TTD) in the following scales from the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire: global health status, diarrhoea, fatigue, and pain, will also be assessed.

The End of Study (EOS) is after four years have elapsed from the randomization of the last patient or six months after the last cross-over or re-treatment dose in the study, whichever occurs last.  The time window to start cross-over or re-treatment with Lutathera in this study is within four years after the last patient has been randomized. No formal interim efficacy analysis for inferential purposes is planned for the primary and key secondary endpoints in this study.

Key Endpoints: PFS, QoL, DCR, ORR, DOR, safety, PK octreotide long-acting (60mg)

Key Endpoints: safety/OS/PFS2

1 Randomization ratio: 2:1. Stratification Factors: Grade (G2 vs G3) and Tumour Origin (pNET vs other origin).

- 2 Octreotide long-acting 30 mg every 8 weeks during Lutathera treatment and every 4 weeks after last Lutathera treatment.

3 Somatostatin analogues in re-treatment phase are at discretion of investigator

- 4 If RECIST progression occurs after Week 72 post the primary end point analysis, the decision to enroll the patient in re-treatment will be based on local assessment.
- 5 Patients included in the optional crossover or re-treatment phase will be followed up to 3 years or EoS, whichever occurs first.

For additional details on the efficacy and safety assessment schedules by visit, see Table 8-3 and Table 8-4 of the protocol.

## 1.2 Study objectives and endpoints

The study's primary, secondary, and explorative objectives and endpoints are described in Table 1.2-1.

## 1.3 Study estimands

## 1.3.1 Primary estimand

The  scientific  objective  guiding  the  primary  analysis  is  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of Lutathera plus octreotide long-acting compared to high dose octreotide long-acting in delaying the time to first occurrence of radiological progression or death, for the target population, based on central assessment, had no participant initiated new antineoplastic therapy, crossed over to Lutathera or being re-treated with Lutathera.

The primary efficacy endpoint, PFS, is defined as the time from randomization to the first line progression (centrally assessed according to RECIST v1.1) or death due to any cause, before initiation  of  any  new  antineoplastic  therapy,  cross-over  to  Lutathera  or  re-treatment  with Lutathera (hereafter referred to as new therapies) and regardless of treatment discontinuation. If a participant has not progressed or died before initiation of a new therapy, then PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment prior to start of the new therapy.

The primary estimand is comprehensively described by the following attributes:

1. The target  population comprises  all  participants  randomized  with  somatostatin receptor positiv e, well differentiated G2 (Ki67 index ≥10% to ≤ 20%) or G3 (Ki67 &gt; 20%  and  ≤  55%)  advanced  GEP -NETs,  previously  untreated  with  any  systemic therapies other than Somatostain analogues (SSAs) for inoperable metastatic disease. Patients with documented RECIST progression to SSAs for the current GEP-NET at any time prior to randomization are not eligible to participate in this study.
2. The primary variable is PFS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented radiological progression or death due to any cause, based on central assessment and using RECIST v1.1 criteria.
3. Intercurrent events of interest in this study are:
- a. Discontinuation of study treatment for any reason before central PFS event: this intercurrent event is ignored (treatment policy strategy).
- b. New anti-neoplastic therapy, including cross-over to Lutathera, before central PFS event: PFS is censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment prior to initiation of the new anti-neoplastic therapy (hypothetical strategy).
- c. Re-treatment before central PFS event: PFS is censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment prior to re-treatment (hypothetical strategy).
4. The summary measure is  hazard  ratio  for  PFS between the 2 treatments. It will be estimated  using  the  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  stratified  by  randomization stratification  factors.  The  primary  comparison  will  be  performed  using  log-rank  test stratified by randomization stratification factors.

## 1.3.2 Secondary estimand #1

The first key secondary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of Lutathera plus octreotide long-acting compared to high dose octreotide long-acting, in terms of objective response rate, for the target population, based on central assessment regardless of discontinuation of study treatment.

The first key secondary endpoint, ORR, is defined as the proportion of participants with best overall  response  (BOR)  of  unconfirmed  complete  response  (CR)  or  unconfirmed  partial response (PR), as per central review and according to RECIST v1.1, reported before initiation of any new therapy.

The secondary estimand #1 is comprehensively described by the following four attributes:

1. The target  population comprises  all  participants  randomized  with  somatostatin receptor positive, well differentiated G2 (Ki67 index ≥10% to ≤ 20%) or G3 (Ki67 &gt; 20%  and  ≤  55%)  advanced  GEP -NETs,  previously  untreated  with  any  systemic therapies other than Somatostain analogues (SSAs) for in-operable metastatic disease. Patients with documented RECIST progression to SSAs for the current GEP-NET at any time prior to randomization are not eligible to participate in this study.
2. The variable is best overall response (BOR) with unconfirmed complete response (CR) or unconfirmed partial response (PR), as per central review and according to RECIST 1.1.
3. Intercurrent events of interest in this study are:
- a. Discontinuation of study treatment for any reason before response.
- b. New anti-neoplastic therapy, including cross-over to Lutathera, before response.
- c. Re-treatment before response.

Details on how to handle intercurrent events are provided in Section 2.6.3.

4. The summary measure is the odds ratio for ORR between the 2 treatments.  It will be estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) with stratification by randomization stratification factors.

## 1.3.3 Secondary estimand #2

The  second  key  secondary  objective  is  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  Lutathera  plus octreotide  long-acting  compared  to  high  dose  octreotide  long-acting,  in  terms  of  time  to deterioration  in  selected  QoL  items/scales,  had  no  participant  initiated  new  antineoplastic therapy, crossed over to Lutathera or being re-treated with Lutathera.

The  second  key  secondary  endpoint,  time  to  deterioration  (TTD)  for  EORTC  QLQ-C30 questionnaire  in  the  following  scores:  global  health  status,  diarrhoea,  fatigue,  and  pain,  is defined  as  time  from  randomization  to  the  first  deterioration  of  at  least  10 points in score compared to the baseline score  or  death  while  on-treatment  (Strosberg et  al. 2018),  before initiation  of  any  new  antineoplastic  therapy,  cross-over  to  Lutathera  or  re-treatment  with

## Confidential

Lutathera  (hereafter  referred  to  as  new  therapies)  and  regardless  of  use  of  symptomatic medications while on treatment. Each selected item/scale is analyzed separately as outlined.

The secondary estimand #2 is comprehensively described by the following four attributes:

1. The target  population comprises  all  participants  randomized  with  somatostatin receptor positive, well differentiated G2 (Ki67 index ≥10% to ≤ 20%) or G3 (Ki67 &gt; 20%  and  ≤  55%)  advanced  GEP -NETs,  previously  untreated  with  any  systemic therapies other than Somatostain analogues (SSAs) for in-operable metastatic disease. Patients with documented RECIST progression to SSAs for the current GEP-NET at any time prior to randomization are not eligible to participate in this study.
2. The variable is TTD, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first deterioration of 10 points (TTD) of the considered item/scale or death while ontreatment.
3. Intercurrent events of interest in this study are:
- a. Discontinuation of study treatment for any reason before deterioration.
- b. New  anti-neoplastic therapy, including cross-over to Lutathera, before deterioration.
- c. Re-treatment before deterioration.
- d. Use  of  symptomatic  medications  associated  with  the  considered  scale/item before deterioration.

Details on how to handle intercurrent events are provided in Section 2.6.3.

4. The summary measure is  hazard ratio for TDD between the 2 treatments. It will be estimated  using  the  Cox  proportional  hazards  model  stratified  by  randomization stratification  factors.  The  primary  comparison  will  be  performed  using  log-rank  test stratified by randomization stratification factors.

## 2 Statistical methods

## 2.1 Data analysis general information

All planned analyses will be performed by the Sponsor. SAS version 9.4 or later will be used to perform all data analyses and to generate tables, figures and listings.

## Data included in the analysis

The primary analysis is planned for the efficacy (including primary efficacy endpoint) and safety after 99 PFS events have been confirmed. A unique cut-off date will be established after the targeted number of events for the planned analysis has been documented. Similarly, at End of Study a unique cut-off date will be established. For each of the analysis time points, all statistical analyses will be performed using all data collected in the database up to the data cut-off date. All data with an assessment date or event start date (e.g., vital sign assessment

date or start date of an adverse event) prior to or on the cut-off date will be included in the analysis. Any data collected beyond the cut-off date will not be included in the analysis and will not be used for any derivations.

All events with start date before or on the cut-off date and end date after the cut-off date will be reported as 'ongoing'. The same rule will be applied to events starting before or on the cut-off date and not having documented end date.

The analysis cutoff date for the final analysis of study data will be established at the end of the study after four years have elapsed from the randomization of the last patient or six months after the last cross-over or re-treatment dose in the study, whichever occurs last.

## General analysis conventions

Pooling of centers: Unless specified otherwise, data from all study centers will be pooled for the analysis. Due to expected small number of patients enrolled at centers, no center effect will be assessed. Protocol deviations, number of patients in analysis populations and discontinuations from study treatment will be summarized by center.

Qualitative data (e.g., gender, race, etc.) will be summarized by means of contingency tables by  treatment  group;  a  missing  category  will  be  included  as  applicable.  Percentages  will  be calculated  using  the  number  of  patients  in  the  relevant  population  or  subgroup  as  the denominator.

Quantitative data (e.g., age, body weight, etc.) will be summarized by appropriate descriptive statistics  (i.e.,  mean,  standard  deviation,  median,  Q1,  Q3,  minimum,  and  maximum)  by treatment group.

## 2.1.1 General definitions

## 2.1.1.1 Investigational drug and study treatment

Investigational drug , will refer to Lutathera ®  ([ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE) only.

The date of last administration of component of study treatment will also be referred to as the end of component of study treatment.

## 2.1.1.4 Date of first administration of study treatment

The date of first administration of study treatment in a specific study treatment period is defined as the first date when a non-zero dose of any component of study treatment is administered in that period. The date of first administration of study treatment will also be referred to as the start of study treatment. (Example: if 1st dose of Lutathera ®  is administered on 03-April-2020, and 1st dose of Sandostatin ®  LAR Depot (octreotide long-acting) is administered on 04-April2020, then the date of first administration of study treatment is on 03-April-2020.)

## 2.1.1.5 Date of last administration of study treatment

The date of last administration of study treatment in a specific study treatment period is defined as the last date when a non-zero dose of any component of study treatment is administered in that period. The date of last administration of study treatment will also be referred to as the end of study treatment.  In this particular study, Lutathera ®  is given every 8 weeks up to four doses, and Sandostatin ®  LAR Depot (octreotide long-acting).

(Example:  if  last  dose  of  Lutathera ®   is  administered  on  03-April-2021,  and  last  dose  of Sandostatin ®  LAR Depot (octreotide long-acting) is administered on 04-April-2022, then the date of last administration of study treatment is on 04-April-2022).

## 2.1.1.6 Study day

The study day, describes the day of the event or assessment date, relative to the reference start date.

The reference start date is designated as Study Day 1.  Study Day -1 is the day that preceded Day 1.  Study Day 0 is not defined.  Study day is not to be used in numerical computations, for example  in  calculating  exposure.  The  reference  start  date  for  patient's  age  is  the  date  of patient's Informed Consent.

The study day is defined as:

- The date of the event (visit date, onset date of an event, assessment date etc.) -reference start date + 1 if event is on or after the reference start date;
- The date of the event (visit date, onset date of an event, assessment date etc.) - reference start date if event precedes the reference start date.

The  reference  start  date  for safety  assessments  ( e.g.,  adverse  event  onset,  laboratory abnormality occurrence, vital sign measurement, Karnofsky performance status, dose interruption, etc..) is the start of study treatment. The reference start date for all other, non-

safety assessments (i.e.,  tumor  assessment, death, disease progression, tumor response, and patient reported outcomes (PRO)) is the date of randomization.

The study day will be displayed in the data listings. If an event starts before the reference start date, the study day displayed on the listing will be negative.

For efficacy analysis related to the cross-over or re-treatment period, study day is defined as above, with the reference date being the date of first administration of Lutathera ®  during these periods.

Key note:  For certain project level long-term safety examinations of interest with Lutathera ® (such as myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia), the start date of these analyses will be the 1 st dose of Lutathera ®  treatment, irrespective of patient entering either cross-over or re-treatment phase.

## 2.1.1.7 Time unit

A year length is defined as 365.25 days. A month length is 30.4375 days (365.25/12).  Duration reported in months will be obtained by dividing duration in days by 30.4375.  Duration reported in years will be obtained by dividing duration in days by 365.25.

## 2.1.1.8 Baseline

For efficacy evaluations, the last non-missing assessment, including unscheduled assessments on or before the date of randomization is taken as 'baseline' value or 'baseline' assessment. In the context of baseline definition, the efficacy evaluations also include PRO.

For safety evaluations (e.g., laboratory assessments, ECGs, and vital signs), the last available assessment, including unscheduled assessments, on or before the start of study treatment as described in Section 2.1.1.4 will be used as the 'baseline' assessment.  Assessments specified to be collected post-dose on the 1 st date of treatment are not considered as baseline values.

If participants have no value as defined above, the baseline results will be considered missing.

Since study treatment in the randomized treatment phase can still potentially contribute to the safety profile in the cross-over and re-treatment phase, therefore, for cross-over and re-treatment analyses, baseline for safety analysis is the same as defined above, i.e., last available assessment on or before the start of study treatment.

For efficacy evaluations of the cross-over and re-treatment period, the last available assessment on or before first cross over treatment/re-treatment with Lutathera ®  is regarded as 'baseline' for the assessments.

## 2.1.1.9 Definition of study phases

## Randomized Treatment Phase

The  randomized  treatment  phase  starts  on  the  randomization  date  and  ends  at  the  end  of treatment date filled on the end of treatment CRF page (For EOT during treatment phase).

## Extension Treatment Phase

For the control arm patients going into the cross-over period and receiving Lutathera treatment, the cross-over phase starts at the date of 1 st treatment with Lutathera and ends at the end of treatment date filled on the end of treatment cross-over CRF page.

For the investigational arm patients going into the re-treatment period, the re-treatment period starts at the date of 1st re-treatment with Lutathera and ends at the end of treatment date filled on the end of treatment re-treatment page.

## Follow-up Phase

The Follow-up phase starts one day after the end of treatment phase/extension phase (whichever was the last phase that the patient completed) and ends at the end of study date filled on the end of study CRF Page.

## 2.1.1.10  Definition of treatment periods used in analyses

## Pre-treatment period:

From day of patient's informed consent to the day before first administration of study treatment in the treatment phase.

## Randomized treatment period:

An  on-treatment  assessment/event  during  randomized  treatment  period  is  defined  as  any assessment/event in the following time intervals:

- [date of first administration of study treatment, minimum (date of last administration of study treatment in randomized treatment phase + 30 days, 1 st injection of Lutathera in extension phase - 1 day)]

## Between treatments period:

This period starts from the end of randomized treatment period as defined above to the day before the 1 st injection of Lutathera in the extension (cross-over/re-treatment) treatment period. It is not applicable for patients without cross-over/re-treatment and for those who start the crossover/re-treatment period less than 30 days from the last administration of study treatment in the randomized treatment period.

## Cross-over or re-treatment period:

An  assessment/event during the cross-over or re-treatment period is defined as any assessment/event in the following time interval:

- [date of first administration (or re-treatment) of Lutathera, date of last administration of study treatment + 30 days]

Note:    the  calculation  of  study  treatment  duration  will  use  different  rules  as  specified  in Section 2.4.1.1.

Due to the limited and immature data in cross-over/re-treatment period, efficacy analyses for this period or the corresponding subset will not be generated at the time of primary PFS analysis. Instead,  they  will  be  summarized  in  the  future  for  study  update  and  publication  use. Nevertheless,  selected  key  safety  output  will  be  generated  to  include  this  period  for  the completeness of safety review.

Note:  The date of first administration of study treatment and the date of last administration of study treatment are defined in Section 2.1.1.4 and Section 2.1.1.5, respectively.

## Post-treatment follow up period:

The post treatment period is defined as the following:

- For patients who do not receive either cross-over or re-treatment: Post-treatment period starts  at  the  31st  day  after  the  last  study  treatment  administration  in  the  randomized Treatment Phase (i.e,. the day after end of on-treatment period) to the End of Study.
- For patients who cross over to Lutathera: Post-treatment period starts at the 31st day after the last study treatment administration in the Extension Treatment Phase (crossover) to the End of Study.
- For patients who receive re-treatment with Lutathera: Post-treatment period starts at the 31st day after the last study treatment administration in the Extension Treatment Phase (re-treatment) to the End of Study.

## 2.1.1.11  Windows for multiple assessments

For the definition of time windows for visits please refer to the study protocol, [Tables 8-3] and [Table 8-4]. Variations of ± 1 week in the visits schedule are allowed.

Time windows will be defined for descriptive summary of PRO data by visit and longitudinal data analysis. If more than one assessment is available in the same time window, the assessment closest  to  the  planned  date  will  be  considered.  If  two  assessments  are  obtained  equidistant compared to the scheduled visit day, the assessment obtained prior to visit will be considered.

Table 2.1-1 Time Window for PROs

The last contact date is defined as the latest complete date from the above list. The cut-off date will not be used for last contact date, unless the patient was seen or contacted on that date. No date post cut-off date will be used. Completely imputed dates (e.g., the analysis cut-off date programmatically imputed to replace the missing end date of a dose administration record) will not be used to derive the last contact date. Partial date imputation is allowed to derive the last contact date to estimate death or censoring coming from the death form or end of study eCRF, respectively, and these rules are summarized in Section 5.1.2.1.

The last contact date will be used for censoring of patients in the analysis of overall survival.

## 2.2 Analysis sets

## Full Analysis Set

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprises all patients to whom study treatment has been assigned by randomization. According to the intent to treat (ITT) principle, patients will be analyzed according to the treatment and strata , they  have  been  assigned  to  during  the  randomization procedure. The FAS will be the primary population for all efficacy analyses.

## Safety set

The Safety set  (SAF)  includes  all  subjects  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment. Patients will be analyzed according to the study treatment received, where treatment received is defined as the randomized treatment if the subject took at least one dose of that treatment or the first treatment  received  if  the  randomized/assigned  treatment  was  never  received.  So,  if  a  patient randomized  to  the  Lutathera  arm  receives  only  Octreotide,  that  patient  will  be  counted  as  an Octreotide  arm  patient  as  far  as  safety  is  concerned.  Likewise,  if  a  patient  randomized  to  the Octreotide arm receives Lutathera instead, that patient counts as a Lutathera patient.

## Cross-over set

The cross-over set is comprised of all patients randomized to the Sandostatin ®   LAR Depot (octreotide long-acting) arm who received at least one cross-over dose of Lutathera ®  ( 177 LuDOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -Octreotate) following confirmed disease progression per BIRC in the randomized period.

## Re-treatment set

The re-treatment set is comprised of all patients randomized to the Lutathera ®  ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 Tyr 3 -Octreotate) arm who received at least one re-treatment dose of Lutathera ®  ( 177 Lu-DOTA 0 Tyr 3 -Octreotate) after confirmed disease progression per BIRC in the randomized period.

## Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS)

The Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS) includes all subjects who provide at least one evaluable PK concentration at baseline and post-dose.

## 2.2.1 Participant classification

Patients may be excluded from the analysis populations defined above based on the protocol deviations entered in the database and/or on specific subject classification rules defined in Table 2.2-1.

Table 2.2-1 Subject classification based on protocol deviations and non-PD criteria

| FAS              | No written informed consent             | Not applicable                                          |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Safety set       | No written informed consent             | No dose of study medication                             |
| Cross-over Set   | Cross-over specific ICF not completed   | Not applicable                                          |
| Re-treatment Set | Re-treatment specific ICF not completed | Not applicable                                          |
| PK Analysis Set  | No written informed consent             | No evaluable PK concentration at baseline or post-dose. |

## 2.2.2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent

Any data collected in the clinical database after a subject withdraws informed consent from all further participation in the trial, will not be included in the analysis. The date on which a patient withdraws full consent is recorded in the eCRF.

Death events may be used in the analysis if captured from public records (registers), local law and subject informed consent permitting.

Additional  data  for  which  there  is  a  separate  informed  consent,  e.g.,  PK,  biomarker  etc., collected in the clinical database without having obtained that consent will not be included in the analysis. These data will be excluded by the presence of the appropriate protocol deviation criterion.

## 2.2.3 Subgroup of interest

Subgroup analyses will be performed for efficacy and safety as outlined below.

## Efficacy

The  primary  efficacy  and  key  secondary endpoints will  be  summarized  by  the  following subgroups to examine the homogeneity of treatment effect provided that the primary efficacy analysis, and, key secondary analysis , based on the FAS are statistically significant:

- Tumor grade: G2 vs. G3 per eCRF
- Tumor origin: pNET vs. other origin per eCRF
- Small intestine as primary site of cancer (a subset of other origin per eCRF)
- Age category (&lt;65 years vs. ≥ 65 years )
- Sex (Female vs. Male)
- Race (White vs. Asian)
- Tumor burden at baseline (Limited vs. Moderate vs. Extensive)

- Chromogranin A (CgA) prior to randomization (≤2 xULN vs. &gt; 2xULN)
- SSTR highest tumor uptake score as per central assessment (Grade 3 vs. Grade 4)

So, if the primary efficacy endpoint is significant, the above applies to that endpoint. If a key secondary endpoint is significant, the above applies to that endpoint.

No formal statistical test of hypotheses will be performed for the subgroups, only point estimate of the treatment effect and 95 % -confidence intervals will be provided (see Section 2.5.6 for further  analysis  details).  The  objective  of  the  efficacy  subgroup  analysis  is  to  demonstrate homogeneity of treatment effect in the above subgroups.

## Safety

Safety subgroup analyses will use the same method as for the analysis in the overall analysis set.  Key  safety  analyses  (deaths  and  SAEs)  will  be  repeated  on  safety  set  in  the  following subgroups:

- Age category (&lt;65 years vs. ≥ 65 years )
- Sex (Female vs. Male)
- Race (White vs. Asian)
- Creatine clearance at baseline ( &lt;60 mL/min vs. ≥ 60 mL/min)

The objective for carrying out these subgroup analyses is to identify potential safety issues that may be limited to a subgroup of patients, or safety issues that are more commonly observed in a subgroup of patients.

Summary tables will only be performed if at least 10% of patients or 10 patients are present in each subgroup. Some grouping of classes will be considered if necessary to obtain a sufficient number of observations.

## 2.3 Patient disposition, demographics and other baseline characteristics

The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be used for all baseline and demographic summaries and listings unless otherwise specified. Summaries will be reported by treatment arm and for all patients and listings will be reported by treatment arm to assess baseline comparability.  No inferential statistics will be provided.  Demographic and baseline characteristics will also be summarized for patients who cross over to Lutathera or are re-treated with Lutathera, separately, unless otherwise specified.

## Basic demographic and background data

All demographic and baseline disease characteristics data will be summarized and listed by treatment arm. Categorical data (e.g., gender, race, ethnicity, Karnofsky performance score as categorical)  will  be  summarized  by  frequency  counts  and  percentages;  the  number  and percentage of patients with missing data will be provided.  Those with Asian race will be further

broken down by Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese.  Those with multiple races will be included in Other category.  Continuous data (e.g., age, weight, height, body mass index) will  be  summarized by descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, standard deviation, Q1, Q3, minimum and maximum).  Separate summaries will be prepared for patients who cross over to Lutathera or are re-treated with Lutathera.

## Baseline stratification factors

The number (%) of patients in each randomization stratum based on data obtained from the IRT system will be summarized overall and by treatment arm for the FAS.

## Diagnosis and extent of cancer

Summary statistics  will  be  tabulated  for  diagnosis  and  extent  of  cancer.  This  analysis  will include  the  following:  primary  site  of  cancer, presence of metastases, site of metastases, histopathology grade at diagnosis,  time since initial diagnosis, presence/absence of target and non-target lesions , number and type of metastatic sites involved , ki67, highest SSTR tumor uptake  score  (based  on  cancer  diagnosis  page),  extent  of  overall  tumor  burden,  and,  TNM criteria at diagnosis.  Note: Presence/absence of target and non-target lesions will be based on the central laboratory report on RECIST target/non-target lesion assessment. Metastatic sites will be based on GEP-NET diagnosis page.  Separate summaries will be prepared for patients who cross over to Lutathera or are re-treated with Lutathera.

To further characterize primary site of cancer, primary site locations will be grouped into three categories: pNET, small intestine and other by clinical review. The details of grouping will be covered in the programming specifications.

## Medical history

Medical history  and  ongoing  conditions,  including  cancer-related  conditions  and  symptoms entered on (e) CRF will be summarized and listed by treatment arm. This will include Prior Antineoplastic Therapy (GEP-NET tumor procedures (including surgery and radiotherapy), and, GEP-NET tumor medication). Separate summaries will be presented for ongoing and historical medical conditions.  The summaries will be presented by primary system organ class (SOC), preferred term (PT) and treatment arm. Medical history and current medical conditions will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. The MedDRA version used for reporting will be specified in the CSR and as a footnote in the applicable tables/listings.

## 2.3.1 Patient disposition

Enrollment by country and center will be summarized for all screened patients and also by treatment arm using the FAS. The number (%) of randomized patients included in the FAS will be presented overall and by treatment group. The number (%) of screened and not -randomized patients and the reasons for screening failure will also be displayed. The number (%) of patients in the FAS who are still on treatment, who discontinued the study phases and the reason for discontinuation will be presented overall and by treatment group. Death due to COVID-19 will

be included in the display.  Patient disposition will also be summarized for patients who cross over to Lutathera or are re-treated with Lutathera, separately, unless otherwise specified.

## Protocol deviations

In this study, the term 'major' protocol deviations corresponds to the term 'important' protocol deviations.

The number (%) of patients in the FAS with any major protocol deviation will be tabulated by deviation category (as specified in the study Data Management Plan) overall and by treatment group for the FAS. Major protocol deviations related to Covid-19 will be tabulated separately overall and by treatment group. All protocol deviations will be listed.

## Analysis sets

The number (%) of patients in each analysis set ( defined in Section 2.2) will be summarized by treatment group and stratum.

## 2.4 Treatments (study treatment, rescue medication, concomitant therapies, compliance)

For details concerning rescue medication see Section 6.1 of the Protocol.

## 2.4.1 Study treatment / compliance

Duration of study treatment exposure, cumulative dose, number of doses, average duration of treatment cycles (for Lutathera only), dose intensity (DI) and relative dose intensity (RDI) will be summarized by treatment group. The number of participants with dose reductions/interruptions/modification and the reasons, will be summarized and listed. Details of the derivations and summaries are provided in the following sections. Participants with no exposure to the study treatment component will be excluded from the corresponding tabular summaries.

Categorical  data  will  be  summarized  as  frequencies  and  percentages.  For  continuous  data, mean, standard deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum, and maximum will be presented.

The safety set will be used for all summaries and listings of study treatment.

## 2.4.1.1 Duration of exposure to study treatment

The duration of exposure to study treatment will be calculated as:

Duration  of  exposure  to  study  treatment  (days)  =  ( last  date  of  exposure to  any  treatment component) - (date of first administration of study treatment component) + 1

The duration of exposure to any single component of study treatment will be calculated as:

Duration of exposure (days) = (last day of exposure to study treatment component) - (date of first administration of study treatment component) + 1

The last date of exposure is defined as follows for the study treatment component:

- For Lutathera, the last date of exposure is defined as the last date of administration + 55 days
- For Octreotide LAR, the rules are the following:
- o For  patients randomized  in  the  investigational arm,  if the last date of administration  occurs  after  an  administration  of  Lutathera,  the  last  date  of exposure is defined as the last date of administration for Octreotide + 55 days
- o For  patients randomized  in  the  investigational arm,  if the last date of administration  occurs  after  the  6-week  washout  period  of  the  last  dose  of Lutathera (i.e., Octreotide starts the every 4 weeks schedule after discontinuation of  Lutathera),  then  the  last  date  of  exposure  is  defined  as  the  last  date  of administration + 27 days
- o For patients randomized in the control arm, the last date of exposure is defined as the last date of administration + 27 days

This duration of exposure includes the periods of temporary interruption (of any component of the study treatment for any reason).  The duration of study treatment exposure and exposure to each treatment component will be summarized by treatment group and by treatment period. In addition,  number  of  cyles  and  average  duration  of  cycle  (for  Lutathera  only)  will  also  be summarized for single component of study treatment by treatment period.

For analyses related to the cross-over/re-treatment period, duration of exposure to Lutathera will be calculated as above during either the cross-over or re-treatment period as appropriate. Since administration of Octreotide LAR is optional in the re-treatment period (expected very few  cases),  the  duration  of  exposure  to  Octreotide  LAR  will  not  be  calculated  for  the  retreatment period.

## 2.4.1.2 Cumulative dose

Cumulative  dose  of  a  study  treatment  is  defined  as  the  total  dose  given  during  the  study treatment  exposure  and  will  be  summarized  for  each  of  the  study  treatment  components, separately for randomized period, cross-over period, and re-treatment period, except that the cumulative dose for Octreotide in the re-treatment period will not be summarized due to very limited cases (Octreotide is optional in the re-treament period).

The planned cumulative dose for a study treatment component refers to the total planned dose as per the protocol up to the last date of that study treatment component administration.

The planned cumulative dose is not summarized/listed. It is used for relative dose intensity calculations .

The actual cumulative dose refers to the total actual dose administered, over the duration for which the subject is on the study treatment as documented in the Dose Administration eCRF.

For patients who did not take any drug the cumulative dose is by definition equal to zero.

## 2.4.1.3 Dose intensity and relative dose intensity

Dose intensity (DI) for participants with non-zero duration of exposure to each study treatment component is defined as follows:

- DI (dosing unit / unit of time) = Cumulative dose (dosing unit) / Duration of exposure (unit of time).

For participants who did not receive any study drug, the DI is equal to zero. Planned dose intensity (PDI) is defined as the assigned dose by unit of time planned to be given to participants as per protocol in the same dose unit and unit of time as that of the Dose Intensity. DI, PDI and Relative dose intensity (RDI) is defined as:

## For Lutathera:

- DI (GBq/week) = Cumulative dose (GBq) / duration of exposure (weeks)
- PDI is 7.4 GBq/8 weeks i.e., 0.925 GBq/week
- RDI (%) = DI ( GBq/week) / PDI (Gbq/week) *100

## For Octreotide LAR:

- DI (mg/week) = Cumulative dose (mg) / duration of exposure (week)
- PDI is the following:
- o 30  mg  every  8  weeks  for  those  randomized  in  the  investigational  arm  after Lutathera infusion i.e., 3.75 mg/week
- o 30  mg  every  4  weeks  for  those  randomized  in  the  investigational  arm  after Lutathera  treatment  is  complete  (or  if  Lutathera  has  been  suspended)  i.e., 7.5 mg/week
- o 60 mg every 4 weeks for those randomized in the control arm i.e, 15 mg/week

Note if Octreotide is administrated &gt; 32 weeks (i.e., first 4 cycles) in the randomized period, then PDI = (7.5*duration of exposure (week)-120)/duration of exposure (week).

- RDI (%) = DI (mg/week) / PDI (mg/week) *100

For each study drug (Lutathera or Octreotide), RDI will be summarized by treatment period. Since DI for Octreotide have different schedules between 2 arms, DI will be only presented for Lutathera  to  avoid  any  mis-interpretation  and  mis-comparison  of  Octreotide  dose  intensity between 2 arms.

Both categorical and continuous summaries (i.e., mean, standard deviation, etc.) of  RDI for Lutathera and Octreotide LAR will be presented by treatment period.

Similarly,  since  administration  of  Octreotide  LAR  is  optional  in  the  re-treatment  period (expected very few cases), DI and RDI for Octreotide LAR will not be calculated for the retreatment period.

## 2.4.1.4 Dose delays/interruptions/modifications

The number of subjects who have dose delays/interruptions (for Lutathera only)/modifications, and the reasons, will be summarized separately for each of the study treatment components.

For  Lutathera,  'Was  there  any  delay?',  'If  administered  dose  is  not  full  dose',  and  'Has Lutathera infusion been interrupted?'' fields from the Lutathera treatment eCRF will be used to determine the dose delays/modifications/interruptions, dose reductions, infusion interruptions, respectively.  In  addition,  the  reason  for  dose  delays/modifications/interruptions  will  be presented  for  the  Lutathera  arm.  The  number  of  cycles  delayed,  number  of  infusion interruptions for Lutathera will be summarized descriptively.

For  Octreotide  LAR,  'Is  there  any  delay?',  and  'Different  dose,  specify'  fields  from  the Octreotide Long-Acting treatment eCRF will be used to determine the dose delays, and dose modifications,  respectively.  For  both  arms,  delay/modifications  of  Octreotide  dose  will  be summarized with reason presented. In addition, the number of cycles delayed for Octreotide will be summarized descriptively.

## 2.4.2 Prior, concomitant and post therapies

## Prior anti-cancer therapy

The number and percentage of patients who received any prior anti-neoplastic medications, prior  anti-neoplastic  radiotherapy  or  prior  anti-neoplastic  surgery  will  be  summarized  by treatment  arm.  Prior  anti-neoplastic  medications  will  be  summarized  by therapy  type  (e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and other). The medication therapy type of any  combination  therapy  will  be  classified  based  on  the  following  order:  chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, other. In addition, prior anti-neoplastic medications will be further summarized by lowest ATC class, preferred term and treatment. The above analyses will be performed using the FAS.

## Post treatment anti-cancer therapy

Anti-neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of study treatment will be listed and summarized by ATC class, preferred term, overall and by treatment group by means of frequency counts and percentages using FAS.  Anti-neoplastic cancer surgeries/procedures will also be listed and summarized by overall and treatment group using the FAS.

Post treatment anti-neoplastic therapy will include:

- Medications:
- o Medications which are in the ATC2 class of Antineoplastic agents or
- o Medications which are in the ATC4 class of Various therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals
- o Medications which are in the ATC4 class of Somatostatin and Analogues
- Procedures:

- o Any radiotherapies
- o Procedures  (including  surgery)  with  indication  of  Underlying  disease  in Concomitant non-drug therapies and interventions eCRF page

## Concomitant medications

All medications taken at the start of screening until the end of the treatment phase /optional treatment  extension  Phase  (Cross-over  period)/optional  re-treatment  phase  (re-treatment period), or early termination, are to be recorded. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medications taken during this time frame.

During the Follow-up Phase, concomitant medications must be collected only if administered for related SAEs/AESI and/or for secondary hematological malignancies.  In addition, further anti-tumor treatments for GEP-NET administered after progression must be reported until the end of the Follow-up phase.  Concomitant therapy include medications (other than study drugs) starting on or after the start date of study treatment or medications starting prior to the start date of study treatment and continuing after the start date of study treatment.

Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference Listing  (DRL)  dictionary  that  employs  the  WHO  Anatomical  Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system and summarized by lowest ATC class and preferred term using frequency counts and percentages. Surgical and medical procedures will be coded using MedDRA and summarized by SOC and preferred term (PT).

All concomitant therapies will be listed. Any concomitant therapies starting and ending prior to the start of study treatment or starting more than 30 days after the last date of study treatment will be flagged in the listing.  The safety set will be used for concomitant medication tables and listings for the randomized period.

## 2.5 Analysis of the primary objective

The  primary  objective  of  the  study  is  to  determine  whether  Lutathera  is  superior  to  active comparator in delaying the time-to-first occurrence of progression or death (PFS) as first line treatment.

## 2.5.1 Primary endpoint

The primary endpoint of the study is progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documented progression or death due to any cause. PFS will be assessed via central review according to RECIST 1.1. The Full Analysis Set will be the primary analysis population and will include all data observed up to the cut-off date.

If a patient has not progressed or died by the analysis cut-off date, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor evaluation date before the cut-off date.

PFS events documented after the initiation of new anti-neoplastic therapy (i.e., RECIST 1.1 documented disease progression per central review or death) will be censored for the primary analysis at the last adequate tumor assessment prior to start of the new therapy.  A separate

sensitivity analysis will be conducted that considers such events as PFS events for the primary analysis provided central review of tumor assessments continues after initiation of new cancer therapy.  Additional details regarding censoring rules and determination of date of last adequate tumor assessment are provided in Section 2.5.3.

Discontinuation due to disease progression (collected on the 'End of Treatment' disposition page) without supporting objective evidence satisfying progression criteria per RECIST 1.1 will not be considered disease progression for PFS derivation.  Clinical deterioration will not be considered as a qualifying event for progression in the primary analysis.

## 2.5.2 Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis

Assuming proportional hazards model for PFS, the null hypothesis will be tested at one-sided 2.5% level of significance:

H01 (null hypotheses): Θ 1 ≥ 0 vs. H a1 (alternative hypotheses): Θ 1 &lt; 0, w here Θ 1 is the log hazard ratio of PFS in the Lutathera plus Standard Dose octreotide long-acting (30 mg) (investigational) arm vs. High Dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg) (control) arm.

H0 (null hypothesis): SL (t) ≤ S C(t) will be tested against the following

Ha (alternative hypothesis): SL(t) &gt; SC(t), where SL(t) is the survival function of PFS in the Lutathera plus Standard Dose octreotide long-acting (30 mg) (investigational) arm, and SC(t) is the survival function of PFS in the High Dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg) (control) arm.

The primary efficacy analysis to test this hypothesis and compare the two treatment groups will consist of a stratified log-rank test at an overall onesided 2.5% level of significance in favor of the Lutathera plus Standard Dose octreotide long-acting (30 mg) arm. The stratification will be based  on  following  randomization  stratification  factors  (histological  grade:  G2  vs.  G3;  and tumor origin: pNET vs other origin).

Analyses will be based on the FAS population according to the randomized treatment group and strata assigned at randomization. The PFS distribution will be estimated using the KaplanMeier method, and KaplanMeier curves, median and associated 95% confidence intervals will be presented for each treatment group. The hazard ratio for PFS will be calculated, along with its 95% confidence interval, from a stratified Cox model using the same stratification factors as for the log-rank test.

In case of few events in some stratum, which may seriously impact the power, the primary analysis will instead be unstratified. More specifically, if any of the four strata counts less than eight PFS events, the primary analysis will be unstratified (Vittinghof and McCullugh, 2007). Both stratified and unstratified analyses will be presented.

More technical details concerning the analysis of PFS follow in Section 5.4.1.

## 2.5.3 Handing of intercurrent events of primary estimand

The analysis will account for different intercurrent events as explained in the following:

- a. Discontinuation of study treatment for any reason before central PFS event: this intercurrent event is ignored (treatment policy strategy).
- b. New anti-neoplastic therapy, including cross-over to Lutathera, before central PFS event: PFS is censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment prior to initiation of the new anti-neoplastic therapy (hypothetical strategy).
- c. Re-treatment  before  central  PFS  event:  PFS  is  censored  at  the  date  of  the  last adequate tumor assessment prior to re-treatment (hypothetical strategy).

## 2.5.4 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations

This is an event-driven trial and the primary analysis for PFS will be performed after 99 PFS events have been documented based on central review of tumor assessments.

In the primary analysis, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate tumor assessment if no PFS event is observed prior to the analysis cut-off date.

Disease  progressions  (i.e.,  central  review  RECIST  1.1  documented  disease  progression)  or deaths documented after the initiation of new anti-cancer therapy will not be counted as PFS events for the primary analysis.

The date of last adequate tumor assessment is the date of the last tumor assessment with overall response of CR, PR, or SD before an event or a censoring reason occurred.  In this case, the last tumor evaluation date at that  assessment  will  be  used.    If  no  post-baseline  assessments  are available (before an event or a censoring reason occurred) then the date of randomization will be used.

In particular, PFS will be censored at the last adequate tumor assessment if one of the following occurs: absence of event; the event occurred after two or more missing tumor assessments.

The term 'missing adequate tumor assessment' is defined as a tumor assessment not performed or tumor assessment with overall response of 'UNK'. The rule to determine number of missing tumor  assessments  is  based  on  the  time  interval  between  the  date  of  last  adequate  tumor assessment and the date of an event. If the interval is greater than twice the protocol-specified interval between the tumor assessments and 2 times the protocol-allowed time window around assessments, then the number of missing assessments will be 2 or more.

Note that according to the protocol the first tumor assessment should occur at 16 weeks, then the second tumor assessment should occur 8 weeks later, and then the frequency should be every 12 weeks thereafter. For patients who discontinue from treatment without PD due to central review,  tumor  assessments  should  be  taken  every  12  weeks  starting  from  the  last  tumor assessment until documented disease progression for central review per RECIST 1.1.  Exact time windows to take into account missing assessments for PFS event determination is further discussed in Section 5.5.

Refer to Table 2.5-1 for censoring and event date options and outcomes for primary PFS.

| G. Start of new anticancer therapy, cross-over to or re- treatment with Lutathera prior to protocol defined progression per central review       | Primary analysis: Censor patient at last adequate tumor assessment prior to new anti- cancer therapy | Censored                |
| H. Death before first PD assessment                                                                                                              | Date of death                                                                                        | Event                   |

In particular, for censoring reason G in Table 2.5-1, new anticancer therapy is defined as one of the following:

- For new anti-cancer medications post-randomization:
- o Medications which are in the ATC2 class of Antineoplastic agents or
- o Medications which are in the ATC4 class of Various therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals

- o Class of medications of Somatostatin and Analogues excluding Octreotide and Octreotide Acetate
- For new anti-cancer procedures post randomization:
- o Any radiotherapies
- o Procedures  (including  surgery)  with  indication  of  Underlying  disease  in Concomitant non-drug therapies and interventions eCRF page

## 2.5.5 Sensitivity analyses

If there is a high rate of discrepancy (≥10%) between the strata classifications constructed using the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) data and those obtained from the Interactive Response Technology (IRT), a sensitivity analysis will be performed for PFS per central assessment in which a stratified Cox regression model will be used to estimate the treatment hazard ratio and the associated 95% confidence interval based on the eCRF-derived strata. No other inferential statistics will be provided.

In  addition, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for PFS as per central assessment will also be obtained from an unstratified Cox model.

Finally, as sensitivity analyses performed in the FAS, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for PFS per blinded independent central review will be obtained from:

- A  stratified  (using  the  randomization  stratification  factors)  and  covariate  adjusted  Cox model including  covariates  at  baseline:  Age  (&lt;65  years  vs. ≥  65  years ),  Gender,  Race, Tumor burden at baseline, CgA,  and SSTR tumor uptake score per central review. See Section 2.2.3 for more detailed definition of involved covariates. Time since diagnosis or metastasis  will  be  taken  as  continuous  variables  in  the  model.    All  covariates  will  be included in the model regardless of their observed significance (p-value for given covariate).

## 2.5.6 Supplementary analyses

As supplementary analyses, PFS as per local review will be analyzed using a stratified Cox model, with the same analysis conventions as the primary efficacy analysis, and the treatment effect will be summarized by the hazard ratio with its 95% confidence interval. Kaplan-Meier curves, medians and 95% confidence intervals of the medians will be presented  for each treatment group.

In addition, the primary efficacy endpoint will be summarized based on the data obtained below to assess different censoring mechanisms. Kaplan-Meier estimate of median PFS along with 95% confidence intervals, and hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval obtained using the Cox proportional hazards model will be provided.  No other inferential statistics will be provided.

- Using the primary analysis source (i.e., central review using RECIST 1.1 criteria) on the FAS  and  including  events  whenever  they  occur,  even  after  two  or  missing  tumor assessments.  The rule to determine number of missing tumor assessments is based on

the time interval between the date of last adequate tumor assessment and the date of event  (see  Section  5.5).  If  the  interval  is  greater  than  twice  the  protocol-specified interval between the tumor assessment and two times the protocol-allowed time window around assessments, then the number of missing assessments will be two or more.  In the summary tables, this approach is referred to as 'actual event PFS supplementary analysis'.

- Using the primary analysis source (i.e., central review using RECIST 1.1 criteria) on the FAS and backdating events that occurred after missing one or more tumor assessments (i.e., if progression/death is observed after one or more missing tumor assessments, it is considered as an event at the date of the next scheduled assessment following the last adequate  tumor  assessment.    In  the  summary  tables,  this  approach  is  referred  to  as 'backdating PFS supplementary analysis'.
- Using the primary analysis source (i.e., central review using RECIST 1.1 criteria) on the FAS and including events that occur after the start of new antineoplastic therapy if no PFS event is observed prior to the start of new antineoplastic therapy (not counting biopsies  as  a  new  antineoplastic  surgery).  In  the  summary  tables,  this  approach  is referred to as 'new anticancer PFS supplementary analysis'.

For  these  supplementary  analyses,  all  analyses  will  be  conducted  using  stratified  Cox proportional hazards model. If there are not enough events in all strata, the analysis will be conducted using an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model.

Additionally, the following analyses will be performed:

- Timing of all tumor assessments according to RECIST 1.1 will be depicted graphically, separately  for  central  radiology  and  investigator/local  radiology  and  displaced  by treatment group.
- Comparison  of  PFS  event  type/censor  between  local  radiology  review  and  central radiology assessment
- Number of participants with a PFS event and number of participants censored for the PFS analysis will be summarized.  In addition, a summary of reasons for PFS censoring will be provided by treatment group. These summaries on censoring reasons will be produced for PFS by investigator radiology and central radiology.

## Subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint

If the primary analysis is statistically significant, subgroup analyses to assess the homogeneity of  the  treatment  effect  across  demographic,  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  will  be performed. Please refer to Section 2.2.3 for detailed subgroup definitions.

For each of the subgroups, the following analyses will be performed:

- Median Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival distribution of PFS
- Hazard ratio with 95% CI using unstratified Cox proportional hazards model.

Efficacy  analyses  in  subgroups  are  intended  to  explore  the  consistency  (homogeneity)  of treatment effect. Forest plot (including sample size/number of events and HR with 95% CI) will be  produced  to  graphically  depict  the  treatment  effect  estimates  in  different  subgroups.  No inferential statistics (p-values) will be produced for the subgroups .

## Censoring pattern of PFS

The  number  of  patients  censored  for  the  PFS  analysis  will  be  summarized.    In  addition,  a summary for PFS censoring will be provided by treatment group based on the following reasons:

1. Ongoing without event
2. New cancer therapy added
3. Lost to follow-up
4. Withdrew consent
5. Adequate assessment no longer available
6. Event after ≥ 2 missing tumor assessments

The PFS censoring are defined in the following way:

If  the  time  interval  between  the  last  adequate  tumor  assessment date and the earliest of the following dates is smaller or equal to interval of 2 missing tumor assessments:

1. Analysis cut-off date
2. Start date of further anti-neoplastic therapy
3. Date of consent withdrawal
4. Visit  date  of  study  treatment  discontinuation  or  end  of  post-treatment  follow-up discontinuation due to lost to follow-up

Then the PFS censoring reason will be:

1. 'Ongoing'
2. 'New cancer therapy added'
3. 'Withdrew consent'
4. 'Lost to follow-up'

If the time interval is larger than the interval of 2 missing tumor assessments with no event observed, then the PFS censoring reason will always default to 'Adequate assessment no longer available'.  If the time interval between the last adequate tumor assessment and the PFS event date  is  larger  than  2  missing  tumor  assessments,  then  the  patient  will  be  censored  and  the censored reason will be 'Event documented after two or more missing tumor assessments'.

These  summaries  on  censoring  reasons  will  be  produced  for  PFS  by  central  review  and investigator using RECIST 1.1.

## Waterfall plot to depict anti-tumor activity

Waterfall graphs will be used to depict the anti-tumor activity. These plots will display the best percentage change from baseline in the sum of diameters of all target lesions for each patient. Only patients with measurable disease at baseline will be included in the waterfall graphs. Special consideration is needed for assessments where the target lesion response is CR, PR or SD, but the appearance of a new lesion or a worsening of non-target lesions results in an overall lesion response of PD. As a conservative approach, such assessments will not be considered for display as bars in the graph, since the percentage change in the sum of diameters of target lesions reflects the non-PD target lesion response, but the overall lesion response is PD. A patient with only such assessments will be represented by a special symbol (e.g.  ) in the waterfall graph. Assessments with 'unknown' target lesion response and assessments with unknown overall response will be excluded from the waterfall plots. Patients without any valid assessments will be completely excluded from the graphs.

The total number of patients displayed in the graph will be shown and this number will be used as the denominator for calculating the percentages of patients with tumor shrinkage and tumor growth. Footnote will explain the reason for excluding some patients (due to absence of any valid assessment).

All possible assessment scenarios are described in Table 2.5-2.

## Concordance analysis of PFS using RECIST 1.1

Cross-tabulation of 'PFS by central review' vs 'PFS by investigator' by PFS event type (i.e., 'death', 'PD', 'censor' for each of the two sources resulting in a 3 by 3 table) and by treatment will be constructed to investigate discordance between the two sources on a patient-by-patient basis (see Table 2.5-3).  Discordance rate between central radiology and investigator will be calculated and presented as % as follows: 100*(n 13 + n23 + n31 + n32)/N by treatment group.

| Censor             | n 31    | n 32 | n 33     |

A  cross-tabulation  will  be  produced  displaying  the  PFS  timing  for  the  local  investigators' assessment  compared  to  the  central  review  assessment  (see  Table  2.5-4).  For  progression assessments, the frequency and percent of subjects with complete agreement, progression later, progression earlier, and cases where progression was called by one method and censored by the other will be displayed.  Similarly, if censoring was recorded, the frequency and percent of subjects with complete agreement, censoring called later, censoring called earlier, and cases where censoring was called by one method and progression was called by the other method will be displayed.

## Cross-over

PFS based on investigator assessment may be performed on the crossover set, if the number of PFS events will allow to perform such analysis.  PFS will be defined as the time from the day of the first dose of crossover Lutathera therapy to the date of the first documented disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 as per investigator assessment, or death due to any

cause.  KaplanMeier curve, median and its corresponding 95% CI of the survival distribution of PFS will be presented.

## 2.6 Analysis of the key secondary objectives

The key secondary objectives in this study are to:

1. demonstrate the superiority of Lutathera, compared to active comparator, in terms of objective response rate (complete + partial response)
2. demonstrate the superiority of Lutathera, compared to active comparator, in terms of time to deterioration in selected QoL items/scales

## 2.6.1 Key secondary endpoints

If  the  primary  endpoint  is  significant,  the  key  secondary  endpoints  of  overall  response  rate (ORR) and QoL will be tested in a hierarchical fashion to protect the type I error rate. The order of the hypothesis testing shall be ORR followed by QoL Global Health Scale (TTD, see below), followed by QoL Diarrhea (TTD), QoL fatigue (TTD), and, QoL pain (TTD).

Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the rate of patients with best overall response of either unconfirmed partial response (PR) or unconfirmed complete response (CR), as per central review and according to RECIST 1.1.  ORR will be calculated based on the FAS according to the  ITT  principle.    Only  tumor  assessments  performed  before  the  start  of  any  further  antineoplastic therapies (i.e., any additional anti-neoplastic therapy or surgery) will be considered in the assessment of best overall response. Also patients with non-measurable lesions per central review at baseline will contribute to the ITT analysis, see Table 2.6-1 below.

Table 2.6-1 Overall lesion response at each assessment: patients with non-target disease only

| Non-target lesions   | New lesions   | Overall lesion response   |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| CR                   | No            | CR                        |
| Non-CR/Non-PD        | No            | Non-CR/Non-PD             |
| UNK                  | No            | UNK                       |
| PD                   | Yes or No     | PD                        |
| Any                  | Yes           | PD                        |

EORTC QLQ-C30 includes 30 items. For more information regarding this instrument, see https://www.eortc.org/app/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/SCmanual.pdf . The following 9 scales and 6 single items are defined (where FS = Functional scale and SS = Symptom scale):

- Global health status / QoL (items 29 and 30)
- Physical functioning (FS) (items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)

- Role functioning (FS) (items 6 and 7)
- Emotional functioning (FS) (items 21, 22, 23 and 24)
- Cognitive functioning (FS) (items 20 and 25)
- Social functioning (FS) (items 26 and 27)
- Fatigue (SS) (items 10, 12 and 18)
- Nausea and vomiting (SS) (items 14 and 15)
- Pain (SS) (items 9 and 19)
- Dyspnoea (item 8)
- Insomnia (item 11)
- Appetite loss (item 13)
- Constipation (item 16)
- Diarrhoea (item 17)
- Financial difficulties (item 28)

For all scales the raw score (RS) is defined as the mean of the respective items:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For a single item, RS is identical to the score of the item itself.

For the functional scales (FS), the score is calculated by the formula:

Score = {1 - (RS - 1)/range} x 100.

For  the  symptom  scales  (SS),  the  single  items  and  Global  health  status  /QoL  the  score  is calculated by the formula:

Score = {(RS - 1) / range} x 100,

For a single item, RS is identical to the score of the item itself.

The  'range'  value  is  the  difference  between  the  maximum  possible  value  of  RS  and  the minimum possible value for RS. The range = 3 for all scales and single items except for 'Global health status /QoL'. For 'Global health status /QoL' the range is 6.

The formulas for the scores are linear transformations of 0-100.

Time to deterioration (TTD) is the main analysis and is defined as time from randomization to the first deterioration of at least 10 points in domain score compared to the baseline score for the  same  domain  or  death  while  on  treatment  (Strosberg et  al. 2018).  Patients  with  no deterioration are censored at the last QoL assessment date. Patients with no baseline and/or no follow-up are censored at randomization.

## 2.6.2 Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis

ORR and its 95% confidence interval will be presented by treatment grou p.

The null hypothesis of the ORR in the investigational arm is less than or equal to the ORR in the control arm will be tested against the one-sided alternative.  The statistical hypotheses are:

H02 : ORRR ≤ ORRC versus H A2: ORRR &gt; ORRC, for a one-sided test where ORRR is the probability of response in investigational arm and ORRC is the probability of response in control arm.

The  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  chi-square  test,  stratified  by  the  randomization  stratification factors, will be used to compare ORR between the two treatment groups, at the 1sided 2.5% level of significance. More details concerning the calculation are provided in Section 5.4.2.

The analysis of QoL Time to Deterioration (TTD) will be the same as for PFS, employing logrank test and Cox regression, see above, and, Appendix for further details.

Assuming proportional hazards model for TTD, the null hypothesis will be tested at one-sided 2.5% level of significance:

H01 (null hypotheses): Θ 1 ≥ 0 vs. H a1 (alternative hypotheses): Θ 1 &lt; 0, where Θ 1 is the log hazard ratio of TTD in the Lutathera plus Standard Dose octreotide longacting (30 mg) (investigational) arm vs. High Dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg) (control) arm.

For each domain, a Kaplan-Meier plot will be produced showing time to event by treatment arm. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to generate a point estimate of the median time to event with corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).

The stratified log-rank test will be used to compare the time to event in the two groups at the onesided 2.5% level . The hazar d ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated from a stratified Cox proportional hazards model including randomized treatment as a factor. If too few events occur in any stratum (less than eight), then the main analysis will be unstratified. Both stratified and unstratified analyses will be presented.

## 2.6.3 Handing of intercurrent events of secondary estimands

## Secondary estimand #1 (ORR)

The analysis will account for different intercurrent events as explained in the following:

- a. Discontinuation  of  study  treatment  for  any  reason  before  response:  this  event  is ignored (treatment policy strategy).
- b. New anti-neoplastic therapy, including cross-over to Lutathera, before response: the participant is considered as non-responder (composite strategy).

Confidential

- c. Re-treatment  before  response:  the  participant  is  considered  as  non-responder (composite strategy).

## Secondary estimand #2 (TTD)

The analysis will account for different intercurrent events as explained in the following:

- a. Discontinuation  of  study  treatment  for  any  reason  before  deterioration:  QoL assessments  collected  on  the  randomized  study  treatment  will  be  used  in  the analysis. Assessments collected after end of study treatment will be excluded from the analysis (While on treatment strategy).
- b. New anti-neoplastic therapy, including cross-over to Lutathera, before deterioration: TDD is censored at the date of the last assessment prior to initiation of the new antineoplastic therapy (hypothetical strategy).
- c. Re-treatment before deterioration: TDD is censored at the date of the last assessment prior to re-treatment (hypothetical strategy).
- d. Use of symptomatic medications associated with the considered scale/item before deterioration: this intercurrent event is ignored (treatment policy strategy).

## 2.6.4 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations

## Secondary estimand #1 (ORR)

Patients with unknown or missing best overall response (BOR) will be counted as failures, i.e., non-responders. Patients who were non-responders before initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy will still be non-responders. If there is no baseline tumor assessment, all post-baseline overall  lesion  responses  are  expected  to  be  'Unknown'.  If  no  valid  post-baseline  tumor assessments are available, the best overall response must be 'Unknown'. For the computation of ORR, these patients will be included in the FAS and will be counted as 'failures'.

## Secondary estimand #2 (TTD)

Missing items in scores will be imputed by the following method:

For QoL scores, if at least half of the items from the scale have been answered then use all the items that were completed and apply the standard equation for calculating the Raw Score (RS). No imputation of missing booklets will be performed.

The assignment of event/censoring will follow the scheme in Table 2.6-2 below.

## Table 2.6-2 Derivation of TTD

| Situation                                  | Options                                  | Outcome   |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| A. No baseline or post-baseline assessment | Date of randomization/start of treatment | Censored  |

| B. Deterioration at or before next scheduled assessment   | Date of assessment                                                                              | Event    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| C. Deterioration after exactly one missing assessment     | Date of assessment                                                                              | Event    |
| D. Deterioration after two or more missing assessments    | Date of last adequate (with at least half of items from appropriate scale completed) assessment | Censored |
| E. No deterioration                                       | Date of last adequate (with at least half of items from appropriate scale completed) assessment | Censored |

## 2.6.5 Sensitivity analyses

## Secondary estimand #1 (ORR)

If there is a high rate of discrepancy (≥10%) between the strata classifications constructed using the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) data and those obtained from the Interactive Response Technology (IRT), a sensitivity analysis will be performed for ORR, in which Odds ratio of ORR between treatment groups along with 95% CIs will be provided using stratified CMH method based on the eCRF-derived strata. No other inferential statistics will be provided.

## Secondary estimand #2 (TTD)

If there is a high rate of discrepancy (≥10%) between the strata classifications constructed using the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) data and those obtained from the Interactive Response Technology (IRT), a sensitivity analysis will be performed for TTD in which a stratified Cox regression model will be used to estimate the treatment hazard ratio and the associated 95% confidence interval  based  on the  eCRF-derived  strata.  No other inferential statistics will be provided.

In addition, the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for TTD will also be obtained from an unstratified Cox model.

## 2.6.6 Supplementary analyses on Key secondary endpoints

## Secondary estimand #1 (ORR)

As  a  supplementary  analysis,  ORR  with  unconfirmed  response  based  on  the  FAS  will  be summarized using descriptive statistics (N, %) by treatment group along with two -sided exact binomial 95% CIs for th e following calculations:

- ORR with unconfirmed response per local review based on the FAS

## Confidential

A concordance summary table will be generated to compare the best overall response based on central vs. local review.

Patients with best overall response 'unknown' will be summarized by reason for having unknown status. The following reasons will be used:

- No valid post-baseline assessment
- All post-baseline assessments have overall response UNK
- New anti-neoplastic therapy started before first post-baseline assessment
- SD too early (≤15 weeks after randomization)
- PD too late (&gt;25 weeks after randomization and not qualifying for CR, PR, SD or non-CR/non-PD)

Special (and rare) cases where BOR is unknown due to both early SD and late PD will be classified as 'SD too early'.

## Subgroup analyses for ORR

If  the  primary  analysis  and  ORR is statistically significant, subgroup analyses to assess the homogeneity of the treatment effect across demographic and baseline disease characteristics will be performed. Please refer to Section 2.2.3 for detailed subgroup definitions.

For each of the subgroups, the following analyses will be performed:

- Number and percentage of participants with unconfirmed CR, unconfirmed PR;
- ORR with twosided exact binomial 95% CIs for each treatment group;
- Odds ratio of ORR between treatment groups along with 95% CIs using stratified CMH method, where IRT stratification factors will be used.

Efficacy  analyses  in  subgroups  are  intended  to  explore  the  consistency  (homogeneity)  of treatment effect.

## Secondary estimand #2 (TTD)

As  supplementary  analyses,  the  secondary  estimand  endpoint  of  QoL  Global  Health  Scale (TTD, see below), followed by QoL Diarrhea (TTD), QoL fatigue (TTD), and, QoL pain (TTD) will be summarized based on the data obtained below to assess different censoring mechanisms. Kaplan-Meier estimands of median TTD of the specific QoL scales discussed above, along with 95% confidence intervals, and hazard ratio and corresponding 95% confidence interval obtained using the Cox proportional hazards model will be provided.  No other inferential statistics will be provided.

- Using the primary analysis source on the FAS and including TTD events whenever they occur, even after two or missing QoL assessments.  In the summary tables, this approach is referred to as 'actual event TTD supplementary analyses'.

For  this  supplementary  analyses,  all  analyses  will  be  conducted  using  stratified  Cox proportional hazards model.  If there are not enough events in all strata, the analysis will be conducted using an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model.

Quality of life will also be assessed in terms of change from baseline through Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM), which are outside the scope of the primary analysis, and will be conducted in the final analysis.

## Subgroup analyses for TTD

If the primary analysis is statistically significant, as well as the key secondary ORR analysis and  the  TTD  QoL  analyses  are  statistically  significant,  to  assess  the  homogeneity  of  the treatment effect across demographic and baseline disease characteristics, subgroup analysis for TTD will be performed. Please refer to Section 2.2.3 for detailed subgroup definitions.

For each of the subgroups, the following analyses will be performed:

- Median Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival distribution of TTD
- Hazard ratio with 95% CI using unstratified Cox proportional hazards model.

Efficacy  analyses  in  subgroups  are  intended  to  explore  the  consistency  (homogeneity)  of treatment effect. Forest plot (including sample size/number of TTD events and HR with 95% CI) will be produced to graphically depict the treatment effect estimates in different subgroups. No inferential statistics (p-values) will be produced for the subgroups .

## 2.7 Analysis of other secondary and exploratory objective(s)

Other secondary objectives of the study are to compare the two treatment groups with respect to:

1. DCR: Disease Control Rate, the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD per central review. Timing: at the primary analysis of PFS.
2. DOR: Duration of Response per central review, time from first complete or partial response  to  progression  or  death  due  to  underlying  cancer.  Timing:  at  the  primary analysis of PFS.
3. OS: time from the randomization date until the day of death due to any cause. Timing of final analysis: when all patients have either had an event, are lost to follow-up, or, four years have elapsed from the randomization of the last patient or six months after the last cross-over or re-treatment dose in the study, whichever occurs last.
4. Rate of adverse events and laboratory toxicities (scored according to CTCAE grade). See Section 2.8 for safety analyses.

Further, these exploratory endpoints are also covered in this section:

- Time to second progression (PFS2), the time from randomization to objective tumor progression on next line treatment or death due to any cause, assessed locally according to RECIST 1.1
- Health related quality of life (QoL) scales, TTD for items/scales not included among key secondary endpoints as well as change from baseline in the total score for health status from the EQ-5D questionnaire.

- PK of octreotide long-acting at the high dose of 60 mg by examining the steady-state trough plasma concentration of octreotide.

## 2.7.1 Other Secondary and Exploratory endpoints

## Disease control rate (DCR)

Disease control rate (DCR) is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR, PR, or SD lasting 15 weeks or longer (corresponds to the schedule of the first tumor assessment [16±1 week]). A patient will be considered to have SD for 15 weeks or longer if a SD (or NCR/NPD) response is recorded at 15 weeks or later from randomization.  A patient is consider to have PD if the PD occurred at or before week 25, and not qualifying for CR, PR, and SD.  The objective of this endpoint is to summarize patients with signs of 'activity' defined as either shrinkage of tumor (regardless of duration) or slowing down of tumor growth.  DCR will be calculated using the FAS for both central review and investigator tumor assessments.

DCR will also be calculated during the re-treatment period for those that are randomized to the Lutathera arm, and then re-treated with Lutathera.  In this case, DCR is the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR or PR or SD lasting 15 weeks or longer after 1 st re-treatment dose of Lutathera, and will be assessed using investigator tumor assessments.

## Duration of response

The  Duration  of  Response  (DOR),  for  participants  with  BOR  of  unconfirmed  CR  or unconfirmed PR according to RECIST 1.1, is defined as the time from initially meeting the criteria  for  response (unconfirmed CR or unconfirmed PR) until the time of progression by RECIST 1.1 or death due to underlying cancer. DOR will be reported descriptively for each group without comparison between groups. The censoring rules in Table 2.5-1 apply. DOR will be calculated using the subset of responders in the FAS for both central review and investigator tumor assessments.

DOR will also be calculated during the re-treatment period for those that are randomized to the Lutathera arm, and then re-treated with Lutathera. In this case, DOR is the defined as the time from initially meeting the criteria for response after receiving re-treatment with Lutathera (CR or PR) until the time of progression by RECIST 1.1 (locally assessed) or death due to underlying cancer.

## Overall Survival (OS)

The time from the randomization date until the day of death due to any cause will be analysed with three different approaches, that all employ Cox regression to obtain the hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval.

1. ITT approach, which analyses data with treatment allocated according to randomization
2. Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time model (RPSFT), which uses an acceleration factor to adjust for any cross-over from Octreotide to Lutathera or for re-treatment of Lutathera  for  those  in  the  investigational  arm;  this  implies  a  modification  of  the

proportional hazards model, see Section 5.4.1.  This approach will be analyzed in the final study analysis, and not in the primary PFS analysis.

3. IPCW, which uses Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting to adjust for any crossover  from  Octreotide  to  Lutathera  or  for  re-treatment  of  Lutathera  for  those  in  the investigational arm, see Section 5.4.1.  This approach will be analyzed in the final study analysis, and not in the primary PFS analysis.

ITT approach is primary. Approaches 2 and 3 are outside the scope of the primary analysis, and will  be  conducted  in  the  final  analysis.  The  analysis  proceeds  by  Cox  regression  as  in  the primary analysis of PFS.

Reasons for censoring ('Alive' or 'Lost to follow-up') and death cause will be listed by treatment arm. Survival status, reason for censoring and death cause will be listed. Patients not known to have died will be censored for 'Loss to follow-up' if the time between their last contact date and the analysis cut-off date is longer than 12 months + 2 months window (i.e. the planned interval between two OS follow-up visits in follow up plus the 1-month window on either side).

## Time to second progression (PFS2)

As additional exploratory end-point, the Time to Second Progression (PFS2) will be assessed in the two study arms. PFS2 is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progression  after  the  start  of  next-line  anti-neoplastic  therapy  or  death  from  any  cause, whichever occurs first. The first documented progression on next-line treatment is based on investigator RECIST assessment of PD.  It is recognized that the limitation due to potential cross-over  or  re-treatment  and  the  lower  scans  frequency  during  follow-up  will  reduce  the possibility to reach firm conclusions on PFS2.

- Next-line therapy is defined as the first new (systemic) anti-neoplastic therapy initiated after discontinuation of study treatment regardless of the discontinuation reason. Drugs given as part of the same regimen should be considered as one line (i.e., part of the nextline therapy).
- Re-treatment with Lutathera (additional cycles after completion of the 4 cycle treatment on study) will count as next-line anticancer therapy.
- Crossover therapy with Lutathera will also count as next-line anticancer therapy
- PFS2 will be censored if no PFS2 event (progression or death) is observed after the start of next line anti-neoplastic therapy and before the analysis cut-off date; the censoring date will be the date of last scan.
- Any death prior to initiation of next-line therapy will be considered as an event for PFS2. Any death occurring following end of next line therapy will be considered as an event for  PFS2 if no second new anti-neoplastic therapy has been introduced. In case that death is more than one year since last scan it will be censored at the time of the last available scan.

As an exploratory long-term endpoint for efficacy, PFS2 analysis will not be performed at the time of the primary PFS analysis, but it will be summarized in the final analysis when data is more mature.

## Exploratory PFS and ORR analysis in re-treatment Lutathera patients

Additionally, for those that receive re-treatment with Lutathera during the re-treatment phase after receiving Lutathera treatment in the treatment phase, ORR and PFS will be assessed during the re-treatment phase for the final study analysis. The last scan per investigator assessment before the beginning of re-treatment will act as the baseline assessment for assessing ORR and PFS in the re-treatment period.

- ORR (Re-treatment): Rate of unconfirmed complete and unconfirmed partial responses after receiving re-treatment with Lutathera (CR, PR) which is locally assessed according to RECIST 1.1
- PFS (Re-treatment): Time from the 1 st dose of re-treatment with Lutathera to objective tumor progression (locally assessed according to RECIST 1.1) or to death due to any cause.

## Karnofsky Performance Status

The Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale is an assessment tool for functional impairment, ranging from 0 (death) to 100 (normal).  Shift table by KPS scale categories (&lt;50, 50-60, 7080, 90-100) to compare baseline to the worst post-baseline value will be generated.

## QoL Items/Scales

TTD for Items/Scales derived from those EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales not included among key secondary  endpoints  will  be  analyzed  as  exploratory  endpoints.  Additionally,  change  from baseline in the total score for health status using GI.NET21 and EQ-5D questionnaire will be explored.

EORTC QLQ-GI.NET21 includes 21 items. For more information regarding this instrument, see Yadegarfar et al (2013). The following 5 scales and 4 single items are defined:

- Endocrine scale (items 31, 32 and 33)
- G.I. scale (items 34, 35, 36, 37 and 38)
- Treatment scale (items 39, 40 and 46)
- Social function scale (items 42, 44 and 49)
- Disease related worries scale (items 41, 43 and 47)
- Single item 1: Muscle/bone pain symptom (item 48)
- Single item 2: Sexual function (item 51)
- Single item 3: Information/communication function (item 50)
- Single item 4: Body image (item 45)

## Confidential

Similar as EORTC QLQ-C30, for all scales the Raw Score (RS) is defined as the mean of the respective items:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

For a single item, RS is identical to the score of the item itself.

For the scales and the single item, the score is calculated by the formula:

Score = {(RS - 1) / range} x 100

Where 'range' is the difference between the maximum possible value of RS and the minimum possible value for RS. The range = 3 for all scales and single items.

The formulas for the scores are linear transformations to 0-100.

Missing items in scores will be imputed by the following method:

If at least half of the items from the scale have been answered then use all the items that were completed and apply the standard equation for calculating the Raw Score (RS). No imputation of missing booklets will be performed.

The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS). The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  The EQ-VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale.

Each of the five dimension scales contain five levels, with level 1 indicating no problems, level 2 indicating slight problems, level 3 indicating moderate problems, level 4 indicating severe problems, and level 5 indicating unable to/extreme problems.

The EQ-VAS is scored by assigning an integer value, ranging from 0 (Worst imaginable health state) to 100 (Best imaginable health state), corresponding to the mark placed by the patient on the VAS. Ambiguous answers (e.g., two marks placed on the scale by a patient) should be treated as missing values.

A utility  score  will  be  obtained  by  using  a  weighted  combination  of  the  levels  of  the  five dimension  scales.  The  weights  are  based  on  value  sets  which  are  country-specific.  Each patient's 5 digit health states code (response to question 1,2,3,4, and 5 concatenated (ex., 41325 results in a utility score of 0.193)) is converted to a utility score using the EQ-5D-5L value set, available in the cross-walk index value calculator which can be downloaded from the web site https://euroqol.org/eq-5d-instruments/eq-5d-5l-about/valuation-standard-value-sets/crosswalkindex-value-calculator/ .  (Scroll to the bottom of the web page and download the Excel file. Use the sheet labelled 'EQ-5D-5L Value Sets.')

Since utility score depends on the combination of all items' responses, any missing response results in a missing utility score.  If a patient dies, for analysis he will be assigned a score of 0 on the date of death.

## Steady-state trough plasma concentration of octreotide

The analysis of this exploratory endpoint is further explained in Section 2.9.

## 2.7.2 Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis

DCR: DCR  per  either  central  or  local  assessment  will  be  summarized  using  descriptive statistics (N, %) by treatm ent group along with twosided exact binomial 95% CIs.

DOR: DOR will be listed and summarized for patients with BOR of CR or PR (unconfirmed). The distribution of duration of response will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the  median  duration of  response  will  be  presented  along  with  95%  confidence  interval. In addition, a swimmer plot will show the time to onset and duration of response based on central review for all patients with unconfirmed CR or unconfirmed PR.

PFS2: PFS2  analyses  will  be  based  on  the  FAS  population  according  to  the  randomized treatment group and strata assigned at randomization. The PFS2 distribution will be estimated using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method,  and  KaplanMeier  curves,  median  and  associated  95% confidence intervals will be presented for each treatment group.

For the efficacy analysis in the re-treatment phase, all efficacy analysis (ORR, DOR, DCR, PFS, PFS2, OS) will be descriptive in nature only.

## 2.7.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations

## Time to second progression (PFS2)

The rules for censoring and event for PFS2 are summarized in Section 2.7.1.

## Overall Survival (OS)

If a patient is not known to have died at the time of analysis cut-off, then OS will be censored at the date of last known patient was alive, i.e., last contact date (see Table 2.1-2).

## 2.8 Safety analyses

For the treatment phase, all safety analyses will be based on the safety set.   Separate safety analyses  will  be  performed  for  patients  during  the  crossover  and  re-treatment  phase  as appropriate.

## 2.8.1 Adverse events (AEs)

All adverse events (AEs), whether or not spontaneously reported by the patient, will be recorded starting from the signing of the ICF until the end of the randomized period/cross-over period/retreatment period. During the Follow up Phase, only related serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be recorded, except for secondary hematological malignancies which will be recorded irrespective of relationship to Lutathera, Octreotide, and amino acid. The data provides information regarding relatedness to Lutathera, Octreotide and amino acid.

AEs that started or worsened during the on-treatment period (including randomized treatment, cross-over  and  re-treatment  periods  as  defined  in  Section  2.1.1.10)  is  defined  as  treatmentemergent AEs (TEAE). The primary AE summaries will focus on all treatment-emergent AEs in the randomized treatment period that started or worsened during the randomized treatment

period, defined as from date of first administration of study treatment to 30 days after the date of the last actual administration of any study treatment in the randomized period before crossover or retreatment. However, selected AE summaries will also be generated for cross-over and re-treatment periods separately. All AEs collected in the eCRF page will be listed along with the information collected e.g., AE relationship to study drug, AE outcome etc. In addition, each AE record in the listings will be flagged for its study period based on the start date.

AEs will be summarized by number and percentage of subjects having at least one AE, having at least one AE in each primary system organ class (SOC) and for each preferred term (PT) using MedDRA coding. A subject with multiple occurrences of an AE will be counted only once  in  the  respective  AE  category.  A  subject  with  multiple  CTCAE  grades  for  the  same preferred term will be summarized under the maximum CTCAE grade recorded for the event. AE with missing CTCAE grade will be included in the 'All grades' column of the summary tables.

In AE summaries, the primary SOC will be presented alphabetically and the PT will be sorted within primary SOC in descending frequency. For randomized period AE summaries, the sort order for the PT will be based on their frequency in the investigational arm .

The following AE summaries will be produced by treatment arm; overview of AEs and deaths (number and % of subjects who died, with any AE, any SAE, any dose reductions/interruptions etc),  AEs  by  SOC  and  PT,  summarized  by  relationship  (all  AEs  and  AEs  related  to  study treatment), seriousness (SAEs and non-SAEs), leading to treatment discontinuation, leading to dose reduction/interruption, requiring additional therapy and leading to death (both related to study treatment and irrespective of study treatment). In addition, a summary of  SAEs with number of occurrences will be produced (an occurrence is defined as &gt;1 day between start and prior end date of record of same preferred term).

## 2.8.1.1 Adverse events of special interest / grouping of AEs

An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is a grouping of adverse events that are of scientific and medical concern specific to Lutathera.

Certain AESIs in this study are flagged in the eCRF by the investigator within the adverse event form, and the categories for Lutathera are included in Table 2.8-1 below:

Table 2.8-1 Adverse events of special interest

| AESI categories                         | Special consideration regarding grade                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Immediate hematotoxicities              | For Haematopoietic thrombocytopenia (SMQ), only include Grade >=2; for others only include Grade >=3. |
| Cardiovascular and Electrolyte Disorder | Only include Grade >=3.                                                                               |
| Secondary hematological malignancies    |                                                                                                       |
| Nephrotoxicities                        |                                                                                                       |

To be conservative and align within the Lutathera NET program, these groupings are re-derived using  MedDRA  terms,  SMQs  (standardized  MedDRA  queries),  HGLTs  (high  level  group terms), HLT (high level terms) or PT. Customized SMQs (Novartis MedDRA queries, NMQ) may also be used. A NMQ is a customized group of search terms which defines a medical concept for which there is no official SMQ available or the available SMQ does not completely fit the need. It may include a combination of single terms and/or an existing SMQ, narrow or broad.

The grouping of AEs in AESI according to project standards will be specified in the electronic Case Retrieval Sheet (eCRS) and may be regularly updated. In addition, further rules regarding grade (see Table  2.8-1) will be implemented  for  the  groupings  of Hematotoxicities, Cardiovascular and electrolyte disorder.

## Data analysis of AESIs

The re-derived AESI groupings using eCRS will be used in the analyses. Summaries of AESIs will  be  provided  by  treatment  arm  (specifying  grade,  seriousness,  relationship,  leading  to treatment discontinuation, leading to dose reduction/interruption, death etc.). Separate summaries for AESIs will be provided for the randomized treatment period, and the overall study period. An analysis of time to first occurrence of each type of AESIs will be performed for the randomized treatment period. In addition, time to first occurrence will also be performed for long-term AESIs for patients who have been treated with Lutathera (see below for more details).

## Time to first occurrence in the randomized treatment period

Median  time  to  first  occurrence  and  95%  CI  will  be  provided  based  on  the  Kaplan -Meier method.  The  event  free rate  at  selected  timepoints  will  be  also  estimated  with  95%  CI. In addition, Kaplan-Meier plots will be generated.

Time to first occurrence of AESI is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the start date of the first occurrence of any AE under the specific AESI in the randomized treatment period,  i.e.  time  in  days  is  calculated  as  (start  date  of  first  occurrence  in  the  randomized treatment period) - (date of first dose of study treatment) +1. A participant will be censored if:

- The participant did not report any post-baseline AESI on or before the analysis cut-off date in the randomized treatment period.
- The participant discontinued randomized treatment without reporting the specific AESI in the randomized treatment period.
- The participant died without reporting the specific AESI in the randomized treatment period.
- The participant received a new anticancer therapy before reporting the specific AESI in the randomized treatment period.

The  censoring  date  will  be  the  earliest  of  the  following  dates:  end  date  in  the  randomized treatment period, analysis cut-off, new anti-cancer therapy start date, death date and last contact date.

In addition, the median time to first occurrence for the subset of participants who experienced the event of interest will be calculated. Simple descriptive statistics, median, min and max as well as 25th percentile and 75th percentile, will be presented.

## Time to first occurrence during the study

For long-term AESIs that can potentially occur after study treatment during follow-up, similar analysis as above will be repeated to consider all study periods, including randomized treatment period  and  any  subsequent  periods  during  the  study.  Such  AESI  includes  secondary hematological malignancies and nephrotoxicity. This analysis is only for patients who have been treated with Lutathera, i.e., patients who were treated in the Lutathera arm and patients who did cross-over from the control arm. For cross-over patients, the time to first occurrence of AESI is counted from the start of cross-over to Lutathera instead of the randomized treatment and it will be summarized separately from the Lutathera arm.

Events/censoring rules are same except that all assessments in the study will be used regardless of study periods. The censoring date will be the earliest of the following dates: analysis cut-off, death date and last contact date in the study.

## 2.8.2 Deaths

Overview of death will be summarized separately for randomized period, cross-over period, retreatment period and post-treatment follow up period. All deaths in the randomized treatment period will be summarized by treatment arm, and by SOC and PT if the primary reason of death is AE(s). All deaths during the study will be listed and flagged by treatment period.

## 2.8.3 Laboratory data

The laboratory assessments require that blood samples for hematology and blood chemistry, and a urine sample for urinalysis are taken (see Table 8-2, Table 8-3, and Table 8-4 of the study protocol). Laboratory assessments will be performed at the investigational site.

The following laboratory parameters will be investigated and analyzed:

- (1) Haematology: White blood cells (WBC) with differential (i.e., Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils), Platelets, Haemoglobin (Hb), Haematocrit, MCV
- (2) Blood chemistry: Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or Urea, Serum creatinine, Uric acid, Albumin, Total bilirubin, ALP, AST/ASAT, ALT/ALAT, Gamma-GT, Sodium, Potassium, LDH, CgA (centralized assessment), Haemoglobin A1C (GlycoHb), fT4, Calcium, Magnesium, Fasting blood glucose, Thyrotropin, Creatinine clearance (calculated by the Cockroft-Gault formula)
- (3) Pregnancy test (if applicable)

On analyzing laboratory, data from all sources (central and local laboratories) will be combined. The summaries will include all assessments available for the lab parameter collected no later than 30 days after the last study treatment administration date (see Section 2.1.1).  Separate

## Confidential

summaries will be generated for the randomized period, cross-over period, and re-treatment period.

Laboratory values outside normal ranges will be listed and flagged. The following flags will be used:

- '+': 'Higher than reference value'
- '-': 'Lower than reference value'

The respective parameter and the flagged value will be presented patient-wise by visit together with the reference values

The following summaries will be produced for hematology and biochemistry laboratory data (by laboratory parameter and treatment):

- Worst post-baseline CTC grade (regardless of the baseline status). Each subject will be counted only for the worst grade observed post-baseline.
- Shift tables using CTC grades to compare baseline to the worst on-treatment value
- For  laboratory  tests  where  CTC  grades  are  not  defined,  shift  tables  using  the low/normal/high/(low and high) classification to compare baseline to the worst ontreatment  value.
- Box plots of laboratory values by scheduled time point.

The following listings will be produced for the laboratory data:

- Listings of all laboratory data, with CTC grades and classification relative to the laboratory normal range. Lab data collected during the post-treatment period will be flagged.
- Listing of all CTC grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicities

## Liver toxicity parameters

Liver parameters of interest are Total Bilirubin (TBIL), Alanine Transaminase (ALT), Asparate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) .  The number (%) of patients with peak  post-baseline  values  and  combined  elevations  post-baseline  will  be  summarized  as follows:

- ALT &gt; 3x ULN, 5x ULN, 20x ULN
- AST &gt; 3x ULN, 5x ULN, 20x ULN
- ALT or AST &gt; 3x ULN, 5x ULN, 20x ULN
- ALP ≥ 2x ULN, 3x ULN, 5x ULN, 8xULN, 10x ULN
- TBIL &gt; 2xULN, 3x ULN, 5xULN, 10x ULN

For the following combined categories, the assessments need not be concurrent, i.e., participants are counted based on the most extreme value for each parameter.

## If AST and ALT ≤ ULN at baseline:

- ALT or AST &gt;3x ULN &amp; TBL &gt;2x ULN
- ALT or AST &gt;3x ULN &amp; TBL &gt;2x ULN &amp; ALP ≥2xULN
- ALT or AST &gt;3x ULN &amp; TBL &gt;2x ULN &amp; ALP &lt;2xULN

## If AST or ALT &gt; ULN at baseline

- Elevated ALT or AST (&gt;3x Baseline value or 8x ULN) and TBIL (&gt;2x Baseline value and 2x ULN)
- Elevated ALT or AST (&gt;3x Baseline value or 8x ULN) and TBIL (&gt;2x Baseline value and 2x ULN) and ALP ≥ 2x ULN
- Elevated ALT or AST (&gt;3x Baseline value or 8x ULN) and TBIL (&gt;2x Baseline value and 2x ULN) and ALP &lt; 2x ULN

Further medical review has to be conducted to assess potential confounding factors such as, liver metastases, liver function at baseline etc.

A figure displaying time  course of hepatic  injury  tests  (ALT,  AST,  TBL,  ALP)  in  patients with Hy's law will be displayed in the Safety Set. Additionally, evaluation of Drug-Induced Serious Hepatotoxicity (eDISH) plots will be produced to display ALT and AST values by TBL values in units of ULN.

Depending on availability of data, plots of hepatic tumor volume against ALT, AST, or TBL values in units of ULN may be generated.

Separate  displays  will  be  generated  for  the  randomized  period,  cross-over  period,  and  retreatment period.

## 2.8.4 Other safety data

## 2.8.4.1 ECG data

ECG data will be summarized by presenting summary statistics of the raw data and change from baseline by treatment group and time point. Notable ECG values will be summarized for the randomized treatment period. All ECG data will be included in listings, and those beyond the randomized treatment period will be flagged by study period.

Notable  elevations  of  ECG  summarize  the  number  of  participants  meeting  or  exceeding predefined  limits  in  terms  of  absolute  QT/QTc  interval  data/PR/RR/QRS  or  changes  from baseline as defined in Table 2.8-2, and notable elevations of ECG includes only newly occurring ECG abnormality.  A newly occurring ECG abnormality is defined as an abnormal post-baseline ECG finding that is not present at baseline.  The percentage of participants having notable ECG interval values is based on the number of participants at risk for the change with a value at baseline and post-baseline.

Table 2.8-2 Clinically notable ECG values

| ECG parameter (unit)   | Clinically notable criteria                                                                                        |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| QT, QTcF (msec)        | New > 450 and ≤ 480 New > 480 and ≤ 500 New > 500 Increase from Baseline > 30 and ≤ 60 Increase from Baseline > 60 |
| PR duration (msec)     | Increase > 25% from baseline and to PR duration > 200 New > 200                                                    |

All ECG data will also be listed by treatment group, participant, and visit. Abnormalities will be flagged.

An ECG in triplicate (at least 5 minutes apart) is recorded with the patient supine, after 5-minute rest, and not immediately after a meal. The parameters will be measured as a mean value of minimally 3 beats; the mean of each parameter will be used for statistical analysis.  If an ECG is conducted, but data is not available in triplicate, the average of the ECG parameters at that assessment by (un)scheduled visit should be used in the analysis.

Frequency tabulations for the ECG interpretation (Normal / Abnormal, not clinically significant / Abnormal, clinically significant) will be presented.

## 2.8.4.2 Vital signs

Vital signs assessments are performed in order to characterize basic body function.  The parameters expected to be collected include: weight, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.  Vital sign data will be summarized for randomized, cross-over, and retreatment periods, separately.

The criteria for clinically notable abnormalities are defined in Table 2.8-3 below:

Table 2.8-3 Clinically notable changes in vital signs

| Vital sign (unit)               | Clinically notable criteria               | Clinically notable criteria              |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|                                 | Above normal value                        | Below normal value                       |
| Systolic blood pressure (mmHg)  | ≥ 180 with increase from baseline of ≥ 20 | ≤ 90 with decrease from baseline of ≥ 20 |
| Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) | ≥ 105 with increase from baseline of ≥ 15 | ≤ 50 with decrease from baseline of ≥ 15 |

## Confidential

| Pulse rate (bpm)   | ≥ 100 with increase from baseline of ≥ 25%   | ≤ 50 with decrease from baseline of ≥ 25%   |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Weight (kg)        | increase ≥ 10% from baseline                 | decrease ≥ 10% from baseline                |

The following summaries will be produced for each vital sign parameter by treatment group:

- Number  of  percentage  of  participants  with  at  least  one  post-baseline  vital  sign abnormality (in both directions, i.e., both elevated and below normal values)

In addition, the following two listings will be produced by treatment group:

- Participants with clinically notable vital sign abnormalities
- All vital sign assessments will be listed by participant and vital sign parameter

In both listings, the clinically notable values will be flagged and also assessments collected later than 30 days after the last treatment date (for those who receive cross-over or re-treatment therapy it would be 30 days after that last treatment date) will be flagged.

## 2.8.4.3 Additional Analyses

Data from other tests will be listed, notable values will be flagged, and any other information will be listed as appropriate.

All assessments collected later than 30 days after the last treatment date will be flagged in the listings.

Subgroup analyses will be explored as described in Section 2.2.3.

## 2.9 Pharmacokinetic analysis

## PK assessments:

Patients in the control arm will yield PK data from blood sampling performed at pre-dose with respect to the octreotide long-acting i.m. injection at week 4, 12, 16 and 24 for the determination of plasma trough levels. These trough levels will be presented descriptively.

Descriptive statistics regarding trough levels of octreotide (n,  arithmetic mean, CV% mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and maximum) will be presented for Pharmacokinetic analysis set.  Since patients in the control arm can start on a lower dose than that specified for the control arm (60 mg), descriptive statistics will be presented for those who start below 60 mg, those that start at 60 mg, and overall.

In addition, the arithmetic/geometric mean (±SD) and median concentration-time profiles over time will be displayed graphically on the linear and semi-log view.

All individual through levels will be listed using the Full analysis set.

The above PK summary will be generated separately, but not be included in the primary CSR.

## PK parameters

Not applicable. No PK parameters will be derived.

## Handling of PK data below LLOQ or missing

All concentration values below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) are set to zero by the Bioanalyst, and will be displayed in the listings as zero and flagged. LLOQ values will be treated as zero in any calculations of summary statistics. The number of non-zero concentrations will also be reported in the summary statistics.

Missing values for any PK data will not be imputed and will be treated as missing.

## 2.10 Dosimetry analysis

For patients randomized in Germany to the Lutathera investigational arm that receive Lutathera (including re-treatment administrations), or patients randomized in Germany to the control arm that receive Lutathera during cross-over, some high-level dosimetry results will be listed as captured in the eCRF per timepoint.

Below are the dosimetry data to be listed:

- Whole body planar imaging
- o Was whole body planar imaging done?  If not done, reason not done
- o Date of Scan and start time of scan
- SPECT/CT imaging
- o Was SPECT/CT imaging done?  If not done, reason not done
- o Anatomical location of imaging coverage (select all that apply)
- o Date and start time of imaging
- Dosimetry calculation
- o Was dosimetry calculation performed?  If not done, reason not done
- o Absorbed radiation dose in kidneys in Grays
- o Absorbed radiation dose in bone marrow in Grays

Any further analyses of dosimetry will be captured in a separate report.

## 2.11 Patient-reported outcomes

These endpoints are covered in Section 2.6.1 and 2.7.1.

## 2.12 Duration of follow-up

Study follow-up will be summarized, including duration between randomization and cut-off date,  and  follow-up  times  for PFS (1 st central progression) and OS separately, which are defined as follows:

- o Duration between randomization and data cut-off date = (Cut-off date - Date of randomization + 1) / 30.4375 (months).  This item will be summarized overall.
- o Follow-up time for PFS = (Date of event or censoring - Date of randomization + 1) / 30.4375 (months) regardless of censoring. Date of censoring is defined as the last adequate tumor assessment date for PFS. This item will be summarized by treatment arm.
- o Follow-up time for OS = (Date of event or censoring - Date of randomization + 1) / 30.4375 (months) regardless of censoring. Date of censoring is defined as the last contact date for OS. This item will be summarized by treatment arm.

All summaries will be reported in months. The calculations for PFS will be based on central assessment.

In  addition,  the  time  from  PFS/OS  censoring  to  the  data  cut-off  date  will  be  separately summarized by time intervals in months: &lt;3, 3 to &lt;6, 6 to &lt;12, 12 to &lt;18, 18 to &lt;24 and by 12 month intervals thereafter if necessary. The gap time is calculated as ([analysis cut-off date] - [censoring date] +1)/30.4375.

## 2.13 Interim analysis

There will be no interim analysis with inferential intent. But, at the time of the PFS primary analysis,  an  estimate  of  overall  survival  will  be  calculated  in  terms  of  hazard  ratio  (point estimate) and 95% confidence interval. Furthermore, a presentation of safety will be prepared including data from the time period up the interim.

## 3 Sample size calculation

The sample size calculation is based on the primary variable PFS. Assuming a median PFS in the control arm (High Dose octreotide long-acting (60 mg)) of approximately 15 months, it is hypothesized that treatment with Lutathera added to standard dose octreotide long-acting will result in a 50% reduction in the hazard rate (corresponding to an increase in median PFS from 15 months to 30 months).

To ensure 90% power to test the null hypothesis: PFS hazard ratio = 1, versus the specific alternative hypothesis: PFS hazard ratio = 0.50, it is calculated that a total of 99 PFS events need to be observed. This calculation assumes analysis by a one-sided log-rank test at the overall 2.5% level of  significance,  patients  randomized  to  the  two  treatment  groups  in  a  2:1  rat io. Assuming that enrolment will continue for approximately 22.2 months at a rate of 10 patients per month and a 15% dropout rate by the time of the final PFS analysis, a total of 222 patients (148 for Lutathera arm and 74 for the control arm) will need to be randomized to observe the targeted 99 PFS events at about 12.8 months after the randomization date of the last patient, i.e., 35 months after the randomization date of the first patient. If the final analysis is performed when the targeted 99 PFS events are observed, the observed hazard ratio will have to be &lt; 0.658 which  corresponds  to  a  difference  in  median  PFS  of  7.8  months  to  declare  statistical significance.

These calculations were made using the software package East 6.4.

## 5.1 Imputation rules

## 5.1.1 Study treatment

The following rule should be used for the imputation of the treatment end date for a given study treatment component:

Scenario 1 : If the treatment end date is completely missing and there is no EOT page and no death date, the patient is considered as on-going:

- The patient should be treated as on-going and the cut-off date should be used as the treatment end date .

Scenario 2 : If the treatment end date is completely or partially missing and the EOT page is available:

- Case 1: The treatment end date is completely missing, and the EOT completion date is complete, then this latter date should be used.
- Case 2: Only Year(yyyy) of the treatment end date is available and yyyy &lt; the year of EOT date: Use Dec31yyyy
- Case 3: Only Year(yyyy) of the treatment end date is available and yyyy = the year of EOT date: Use EOT date
- Case 4: Both Year(yyyy) and Month (mm) are available for treatment end date, and yyyy = the year of EOT date and mm &lt; the month of EOT date: Use last day of the Month (mm)

All other cases should be considered as a data issue and data should be queried.

After imputation, compare the imputed date with start date of treatment, if the imputed date is &lt; start date of treatment: Use the treatment start date

Patients with missing start dates are to be considered missing for all study treatment component related calculations and no imputation will be made. If the start date is missing, then end date should not be imputed.

## 5.1.2.1 Other imputations

## Incomplete date of initial diagnosis of cancer and date of most recent recurrence

Missing day is defaulted to the 15 th of the month and missing month and day is defaulted to 01Jan.

## Incomplete assessment dates for tumor assessment

All investigation dates (e.g., MRI scan, CT scan) must be completed with day, month and year. If  one  or  more  assessment  dates  are  incomplete  but  other  investigation  dates  are  available, this/these  incomplete  date(s)  are  not  considered  for  calculation  of  the  assessment  date  and assessment date is calculated as the latest of all investigation dates (e.g., MRI scan, CT scan) if the overall response at that assessment is CR/PR/SD/UNK. Otherwise - if overall response is progression - the assessment date is calculated as the earliest date of all investigation dates at that evaluation number.  If all measurement dates have no day recorded, the 1 st of the month is used. If the month is not completed, for any of the investigations, the respective assessment will be considered to be at the date which is exactly between previous and following assessment. If a previous and following assessment is not available, this assessment will not be used for any calculation.

## Applying the cut-off to tumor assessment

For tumor related assessments, if an evaluation has some assessments done prior to cut-off date and others after the cut-off date , then the evaluation is considered post-cut-off date and will be excluded from analysis.

## Handling Missing month/day in date of death

For rare cases when either day is missing or both month and day are missing for the date of death the following imputation rules will be implemented:

- If only day is missing, then impute max [(1 mmm-yyyy), min(any valid date from data base used for deriving last contact date+1, cutoff date)]
- If both day and month are missing, then impute max [(1 Jan-yyyy, min(any valid date from data base used from deriving last contact date +1, cutoff date)].

## 5.2 AEs coding/grading

Adverse events are coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology.

AEs  will  be  assessed  according  to  the  Common  Terminology  Criteria  for  Adverse  Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 or current version, or, if the term does not exist in CTCAE version 5.0, according to the 'severity grade'.

The CTCAE represents a comprehensive grading system for reporting the acute and late effects of cancer treatments. CTCAE grading is by definition a 5-point scale generally corresponding to mild, moderate, severe, life threatening, and death. This grading system inherently places a value on the importance of an event, although there is not necessarily proportionality among grades (a grade 2 is not necessarily twice as bad as a grade 1).

'Severity grade' is a 3-point scale corresponding to mild, moderate and severe categories.

## 5.3 Laboratory parameters derivations

Grade categorization of lab values will be assigned programmatically as per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 or current. The calculation of CTCAE grades will be based on the observed laboratory values only, clinical assessments will not be taken into account. The criteria to assign CTCAE grades are given in Novartis internal criteria for CTCAE grading of laboratory parameters shown below.

For laboratory tests where grades are not defined by CTCAE v5.0, results will be graded by the low/normal/high based on laboratory normal ranges.

A severity grade of 0 will be assigned for all non-missing lab values not graded as 1 or higher. Grade 5 will not be used. For laboratory tests that are graded for both low and high values, summaries will be done separately and labelled by direction, e.g., sodium will be summarized as hyponatremia and hypernatremia.

LAB CTC grades in Novartis Oncology (26jul18)

Confidential

## Imputation Rules

CTC grading for blood differentials is based on absolute values. However, this data may not be reported as absolute counts but rather as percentage of WBC.

If  laboratory  values  are  provided  as  '&lt;X'  (i.e.,  below  limit  of  detection)  or  '&gt;X',  prior  to conversion of laboratory values to SI unit, these numeric values are set to X.

The  following  rules  will  be  applied  to  derive  the  WBC  differential  counts  when  only percentages are available for a xxx differential xxx count = (WBC count) * (xxx %value / 100)

Further derivation of laboratory parameters might be required for CTCAE grading. For instance, corrected calcium can be derived using the reported total calcium value and albumin at the same assessment using the following formula:

Corrected Calcium (mg/dL) = Calcium (mg/dL) - 0.8 [Albumin (g/dL)-4]

In  order  to  apply  the  above  formula,  albumin  values  in  g/L  will  be  converted  to  g/dL  by multiplying  by  0.1,  calcium  values  in  mmol/L  will  be  converted  to  mg/dL  by  dividing  by 0.2495.  For  calculation  of  laboratory  CTC  grades  0  and  1,  the  normal  range  for derived corrected calcium is set to the same limits (in mg/dL) as for calcium.

CTC grades for the derived absolute WBC differential counts (neutrophils, lymphocytes) and corrected calcium will be assigned as described above for grading.

For creatine clearance (CrCl), the calculated CrCl from sites will be used. If calculated value is not available, then the below Cockroft-Gault formula will be used to do the imputation:

- Male GFR (mL/min) = [140 - age (years)] x weight (kg) x 1.23 / serum creatinine (μmol/L)
- Female GFR (mL/min) = [140 - age (years)] x weight (kg) x 1.04 / serum creatinine (μmol/L)

OR

- Male GFR (mL/min) = [140 - age (years)] x weight (kg) / [72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)]
- Female GFR (mL/min) = [140 - age (years)] x weight (kg) x 0.85 / [72 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)]

Age/weight at the visit of CrCl assessment will be used. If weight is not available at that specific visit, the latest weight collected before the CrCl assessment will be used in the calculation.

Hypothesis and test statistic

The below description is for PFS

The null  hypothesis  stating  that  PFS  survival  distributions  of  the  two  treatment  groups  are equivalent will be tested against one-sided alternative.

Assuming proportional hazards for PFS, the following statistical hypotheses will be tested:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where 𝜃𝜃1 is the PFS hazard ratio (Lutathera arm vs Octreotide arm).

Stratified log-rank test adjusting for the strata used in the randomization will be implemented as  follows:  In  each  of  the  K  strata  separately,  the  LIFETEST  procedure  with  STRATA statement including only the treatment group variable and with the TIME statement will be used to obtain the rank statistic 𝑅𝑅 𝑘𝑘 and variance var( 𝑅𝑅 𝑘𝑘 ) where k=1, 2, …, K. The final test statistics will then be reconstructed as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

As a sensitivity analysis, unstratified Log-rank test will be used to test the difference between the treatment groups. The LIFETEST procedure in SAS with the TIME statement including a variable  with  survival  times  and  a  (right)  censoring  variable,  and  with  STRATA  statement including a variable for identifying treatment groups will be used. As an output of the procedure, the rank statistic S and variance var(S) will be obtained. Under the null hypothesis, the test statistic Z=S/√[var(S)] is approx imately normally distributed.

## Kaplan-Meier estimates

An estimate of the survival function in each treatment group will be constructed using KaplanMeier  (product-limit)  method  as  implemented  in  PROC  LIFETEST  with  METHOD=KM option. The PROC LIFETEST statement will use the option CONFTYPE=LOGLOG.

Median  survival  for  each  treatment  group  will  be  obtained  along  with 95% confidence intervals  calculated  from  PROC  LIFETEST output  using  the  method  of  [Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982]. Kaplan-Meier  estimates  of  the  survival  function  with 95% confidence intervals  at  specific time  points  will  be  summarized.  The  standard  error  of  the  KaplanMeier estimate  will  be calculated using Greenwood's formula [Collett 1994].

## Hazard ratio

Hazard ratio will be estimated by fitting the Cox proportional hazards model using SAS procedure PHREG (with TIES=EXACT option in the MODEL statement).

- For estimation without stratification the following applies.  An unadjusted Cox model will be  used, i.e., the MODEL statement will include the treatment group variable as the only covariate.
- For estimation with stratification the following applies. A stratified unadjusted Cox model will be, i.e., the MODEL statement will include the treatment group variable as the only covariate and the STRATA statement will include stratification variable(s).

Hazard ratio with twosided 95% confidence interval will be based on Wald test.

## Treatment of ties

The STRATA statement in LIFETEST procedure will be used to analyze time to event data with ties. The PHREG procedure in SAS with option TIES=EXACT will be used to fit the Cox proportional hazards model.

## Checking proportionality of hazard assumption

Plots (SURVIVAL LOGSURV LOGLOGS) generated by LIFETEST procedure in SAS will be used to provide visual checks of the proportional hazard assumption.

- SURVIVAL plots estimated survivor functions.  The shape of the curves should be basically the same if hazards are proportional.
- LOGSURV plots the cumulative hazard functions The larger cumulative hazard should be a multiple of smaller if hazards are proportional
- LOGLOGS  plots  log  (cumulative  hazard).  The  LOGLOG  plot  will  show  parallel curves if hazards are proportional.

As an exploratory measure, to test the proportional hazard assumption, the treatment group * time  interaction  will  be  added  in  the  MODEL  statement  in  PHREG  procedure  in  SAS. Evidence that  interaction  is  not  zero  is  evidence  against  proportional  hazards.  Further,  the correlation  between  time  and  Schoenfeld  residuals  will  be  calculated  to  provide  further evidence concerning the degree of proportionality.

## Multiplicity adjustment

No adjustment for multiplicity will be applied. To protect the type I error for the primary and key secondary endpoints, these will be tested in a hierarchical fashion in the following order: PFS (centrally assessed), ORR, QoL Global Health (TTD), QoL Diarrhea (TTD), fatigue (TTD), and pain (TTD).

## 5.4.2 Key secondary analysis

## Analysis of Binary Data (ORR)

The null hypothesis of equality of response rate in the two treatment arm will be tested against one-sided alternative.  The statistical hypotheses are:

H0: ORRR ≤ ORRC versus HA: ORRR &gt; ORRC, for a one -sided test where ORRR is the probability of response in investigational arm and ORRC is the probability of response in control arm.

Both a stratified and an unstratified analysis will be presented.

The stratified analysis proceeds as outlined below.

The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test  X 2 CMH (implemented again via SAS procedure FREQ with  CMH option in  the  TABLES statement) will be used to test the difference in response rates between the treatment arms. The p-value corresponding to the CMH test for 'general association' will be used which follows a Chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.

If the sampling assumptions for chi-square test is not met, the  exact Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test will  be used (implemented via SAS procedure MULTTEST). The test is performed by running a stratified version of the Cochran-Armitage permutation test [Armitage et al. 1969]. In studies with stratified randomization, the chi-square approximation is considered appropriate for the X 2 CMH statistics if the rule of Mantel and Fleiss [Mantel and Fleiss 1980] is satisfied.

The unstratified analysis proceeds outlined as below.

The Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test X 2 MH (implemented via SAS procedure FREQ with CMH option in the TABLES statement) will be used to test the difference in response rates between the treatment arms. The p-value corresponding to the CMH test for 'general association' will be used which follows a Chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.

If the sampling assumptions for chi-square test is not met, Fisher's exact test (implemented via SAS procedure FREQ with EXACT option in the TABLES statement) will be used to test the difference in response rates between the treatment arms. the rule for determining adequate sample size for X 2 is that expected values should exceed 5 for all of the table cells.

## Confidence interval for response rate

Responses  will  be  summarized  in  terms  of  percentage  rates  with  100(1 -α)% confidence interval using  exact binomial confidence interval (implemented using SAS procedure FREQ with  EXACT statement for one-way table (Clopper and Pearson 1934).

## 5.4.3 Special statistical methods for OS analysis

Patients who progressed on Octreotide LAR are allowed to cross-over to open-label Lutathera. However, Octreotide LAR patients who switch to Lutathera after they progress are likely to benefit  from  the  delayed  administration  of  Lutathera  and,  therefore,  the  survival  treatment estimate becomes confounded. Under such circumstances, the statistical test of the treatment effect is known to be biased towards the null hypothesis of no difference (Robins and Tsiatis 1991; Korhonen et al 1999; Greenland et al 2008).

However, with the inclusion of Lutathera re-treatment for some patients randomized in the Lutathera investigational arm, these patients may have increased OS compared to those who do not receive Lutathera re-treatment after central progression.

Therefore, the following modeling approaches will be used to obtain an estimate of survival treatment effect corrected for treatment cross-over and  re-treatment:  'Rank-preserving

structural  failure  time  method'  and  'Cox  model  with  Inverse  Probability  of  Censoring Weighting'. More details are provided in sections below. Should a patient have switched prior to progression (locally or centrally confirmed), that patient will be analysed similarly to those that switched after progression.

Despite the cross-over and re-treatment design, a supportive analysis of OS will use the strict intention-to-treat (ITT) approach, i.e., 'analyze as randomized' and ignore the treatment switch or re-treatment with Lutathera (and ignore additional anticancer therapies administered after study treatment discontinuation).

## 5.4.3.1 RPSFT approach

The  primary  analysis  of  OS  will  be  using rank-preserving  structural  failure  time  method (RPSFT) to correct for confounding introduced by the change of treatment (Robins and Tsiatis 1991; Korhonen et al 1999). The use of RPSFT method allows to estimate the survival time gained by anyone receiving Lutathera (i.e., either as randomized to Lutathera or after cross-over from Octreotide LAR to open-label Lutathera). The RPSFT model is based on an accelerated failure time model (Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002) and uses a structural assumption of timeproportionality instead of a proportional hazards assumption as used in the Cox model. The widely used Cox model measures drug effect on the hazard ratio scale, whereas the accelerated failure time model measures drug effect on the survival time ratio scale.

## Notation

We  follow  (Korhonen  et  al  1999)  for  the  notation.  The  treatment  assignment  indicator  is denoted by Ri and takes the value 0 if allocated to Octreotide LAR and 1 if allocated to active drug  (Lutathera  10  mg). Stratai stands  to  baseline  stratification  factors.  Each  individual  is followed from the time of randomization ( DRi ) until death or the date of last contact ( EOFi ) and the fixed closing date ( CDi ) which ever comes first. The censoring time Ci = min(EOFi - DRi, CDi - DRi) , is measured in days and is assumed to be independent of the treatment assignment. (Note: in a sensitivity analysis, censoring time Ci = EOFi - DRi will also be considered). Time to death ( Ti ) is the time from randomization to death which is also measured in days. We can only observe Xi = min( Ti , Ci ) with δ i = 1 if Xi = Ti and δ i = 0 otherwise. Some of the subjects randomized  to  the  Octreotide  LAR  arm  switch  to  the  active  drug  at  some  point  after randomization. There may be several different periods when active drug has been received instead of the randomized Octreotide LAR. The total time from randomization to switch is denoted as Ai .  If  no switch occurs in the Octreotide LAR arm then Ai = 0 .  Switching to the active  drug  is  potentially  related  to  the  patient's  prognosis  and  thus  cannot  be  assumed independent of the death time.

Thus, the observed data for each subject i are { Ri , Stratai , Ci , Xi , δ i, Ai } .

## Model

For subject i, we denote Ui as the potential survival time without Lutathera. Ui is a concept that is defined for each subject at the time of the randomization and Ui may depend on the value of

the baseline risk factor. Ui will be observed only for those subjects who will never receive active drug during the study and die before min ( EOFi,CDi ).

For a given time to switch Ai , the Lutathera-free survival time Ui is linked to the death time Ti through a structural model

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where Ai(t) = 1 if subject i has not switched at time t and 0 otherwise. For a fixed value of the parameter ψ the above model can be written as

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

If Ai(t) = 0 for all t then Ui = Ti . If, on the other hand Ai(t) = 1 for all t then Ui = Tie ψ . Thus the parameter ψ has  the  following  interpretation: e -ψ expresses  how  much  the  survival  time  is increased or decreased on relative scale if on Lutathera versus if not on Lutathera.

Therefore, we can see that the main assumption of this method is that the total duration of survival time for each patient is the sum of two distinct parts:

- potential survival time, had no Lutathera been received, and
- time added from multiplying the duration on Lutathera by an unknown factor.

For the estimation of the parameter ψ it needs to be assumed that:

1. the above model correctly captures the drug action
2. no other factor than the amount of Lutathera received, Ai , induces a difference in survival experience for an individual i under different treatment arm assignments
3. the Lutathera-free survival time Ui for an individual i is unaffected by the drug assignment or by the survival experience of other individuals
4. the censoring time Ci is independent of the randomization mechanism Ri

## Estimation algorithm for parameter ψ

Randomization guarantees that any variable measured at baseline will on average be balanced with  respect  to  the  drug  assignment.  In  particular, Ui  Ri where  denotes  statistical independence. This holds also within each of the k strata of the baseline risk factor. It follows that \

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In  other  words,  the  drug  free  survival  time  is  independent  of  the  randomization  within  the different strata of the baseline risk factor. Therefore, a procedure for estimating the parameter

) ( ψ U ^

ψ can  be  based  on  computing i for  various  values  of ψ and  finding  a  value ψ where .  We use the stratified log-rank test statistic for a device to estimate the i i i Strata R U | ) ( ^  ψ

parameter ψ . The stratified log-rank test statistic is obtained from PROC PHREG procedure in SAS. The stratified log-rank test has an asymptotic chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom under the hypothesis 0 ψ =ψ where 0 ψ denotes the true parameter value. From a grid

^

of values for ψ we choose as ψ where the stratified log-rank test statistic has its minimum value. The approximate lower and upper 95% confidence limits are obtained as those values where the stratified log-rank test statistic is close to 3.84. In reality the stratified log-rank test statistic is  a  step  function  in ψ and  therefore  there  might  be  several  values  where  the  minimum  is obtained and also the upper and lower confidence limits need to be chosen as the point for ψ where the value of the stratified log-rank test statistic changes from less than 3.84 to greater than 3.84.

## Complication due to censoring in the estimation algorithm

One complication arises from the fact that due to censoring ) ( ψ i U cannot always be computed from the observed data using the above model. One cannot simply replace Ti by Xi in the above model and calculate the  respective  value,  say ) ( ^ ψ x i U from  the  model  because  then ) ( ^ ψ x i U would not be independent of i R and the assumptions for the estimation would not hold. Instead the censoring is handled as follows.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

By these definitions, ) ( ψ i C is  independent of ) ( ψ i U and Ri .  The  new censoring time ) ( ψ i C can be interpreted as the maximum ) ( ψ i U that can be calculated which is smaller than Ci no matter how long individual i is on the randomized active drug. Both ) ( ψ i X and ) ( δ ψ i can be calculated  based  on  observed  data  and  furthermore .  Thus  the estimation can be performed by calculating ) ( ψ i X and ) ( δ ψ i for the various values of ψ within the different strata of the baseline risk factor and proceed as described in the estimation section. { } i i i i Strata R X | ) ( ), (  δ ψ ψ

This way of dealing with censoring was introduced by Robins and Tsiatis 1991. Note that some extra  censoring  will  occur  due  to  nature  of  handling  the  censoring  times  in  this  estimation procedure. This causes some loss of power.

## Summary of the method and interpretation

Drug effect is obtained by estimating the multiplicative factor; which would be interpreted as either a relative increase or decrease in survival if one took active drug (Lutathera) compared to taking Octreotide LAR. The multiplicative factor is determined by repeatedly reconstructing the  anticipated  survival  duration  of  all  patients  by  varying  degrees  of  the  factor,  until  both survival curves (Lutathera arm and Octreotide LAR) can no longer be distinguished, i.e., as if all patients only received Octreotide LAR.

This  method  maintains  the  original  randomized-group  definitions  and  thus  preserves  the validity of between group comparison. It provides a randomization based estimate of drug effect corrected for the bias due to crossover (under the assumption that the effect is multiplicative in time). This estimate is valid even in presence of outcome dependent drug change. Of note, this method  requires  extra  censoring  (i.e.,  some  events  become  censored)  which  impacts  the precision of the drug effect estimate.

## 5.4.3.2 Marginal Structural Cox Proportional Hazards Model using the Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting (IPCW)

The  Marginal  Structural  Cox  Proportional  Hazards  Model  using  the  Inverse  Probability  of Censoring Weighting (IPCW) will also be considered (Hernan et al 2000) to account for the treatment cross-over.

We  follow    Hernan  et  al  2000  and  Korhonen  et  al  1999  for  the  notation.  The  treatment assignment indicator is denoted by Ri and takes the value 0 if allocated to Octreotide LAR and 1 if allocated to active treatment (Lutathera). The baseline covariates to be included in the model are jointly denoted as matrix Vi, containing the variables Ki67 and Karnosky score. We will consider  two  time-dependent  covariates:    Karnofsky  score  and  investigators  assessment  of disease progression which are collectively denoted as matrix Li .

Each individual is followed from the time of randomization ( DRi ) until death or the last date of contact ( EOFi ) and the fixed closing date ( CDi ) which ever comes first. The censoring time, Ci = min(EOFi - DRi, CDi - DRi) ,  is measured in days and is assumed to be independent of the treatment  assignment  and  also  from  the  death  time.  Time  to  death  ( Ti )  is  the  time  from randomization to death which is also measured in days. We can only observe Xi = min( Ti , Ci ) with δ i = 1 if Xi = Ti and δ i = 0 otherwise. The follow-up time is divided in to intervals k=0, 1, 2,…, K where 0 denotes the baseline.  The length of the intervals after baseline may vary but the  same  intervals  are  used  for  each  individual.    Some  of  the  subjects  randomized  to  the Octreotide LAR arm switch to the active treatment at some point after randomization. Switching to  the  active  treatment  is  potentially  related  to  the  patient's  prognosis  and  thus  cannot  be assumed independent of the death time. The time to switching to the active treatment is denoted by Si and for subjects who do not switch to the active treatment arm we define Si = Xi . We denote

0 ) ( = k A i , if the subject did not receive active treatment during the time interval k and 1 ) ( = k A i , if the subject received active treatment during the time interval k. For subjects randomized to the active treatment arm 1 ) ( = k A i for all k until Xi .  Similarly, for subjects randomized to the Octreotide LAR arm 0 ) ( = k A i for all time intervals k prior to Si and 1 ) ( = k A i thereafter for all k until Xi .  With  these  notations  we  call } );0 ( { ) ( i i i i X u u A X A ≤ ≤ = subjects  observed  active treatment  until  the  end  of  follow-up  and 1} 0, 1 ,..., ); ( { ) ( -= = k u u A k A i i a  subject's  active treatment history until the start of the k th time interval.

Thus the observed data for each subject i are { Ri , Vi , Li ( Xi ) , Ci , Xi , δ i, Ai ( Xi )} .

The usual ITT approach for estimating the treatment effect concerning overall survival is likely to be biased towards zero due to considerable amount of switching to the active treatment in the Octreotide LAR arm.  In order to trying to estimate the treatment effect one might think of estimating the time varying effect of treatment received on overall survival possibly using Cox's proportional  hazards  model  to  model  the  death  risk  as  a  function  of  the  treatment  history

1} 0, 1 ,..., ); ( { ) ( -= = k u u A k A i i . This approach is likely to be biased whenever there is a timedependent  covariate  that  is  (i)  both  a  risk  factor  for  mortality  and  (ii)  which  also  predicts subsequent treatment ) ( u A i and (iii) at the same time the treatment history ) ( k A i predicts the ) ( u L .  In  this  study  the  Kanrofsky performance status after baseline, Ki67 and investigator's assessment of disease progression subsequent  level  of  the  time-dependent  covariate i are such time-dependent covariates.

One  approach  trying  to  finding  an  unbiased  estimate  of  the  treatment  effect  is  to  use  the marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model where the death risk is modeled using a conventional Cox's proportional hazards model using time-dependent case weights for those who did not switch to active treatment but continue to remain on their original randomized treatment.

The marginal structural Cox model is specified as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where a subject stays at risk for death until (s)he switches to the active treatment. Thus, the whole  follow-up  experience  from  randomization  to Xi =  min( Ti , Ci )  is  used  from  subjects randomized to the active treatment arm. But, in the Octreotide LAR arm only the follow-up experience from randomization to min( Si , Xi ) is used in the marginal structural Cox model. This

means in practice that in the Octreotide LAR arm the data after switching to the open label active treatment is discarded. Each subject is given in this model the case weight indicating the cumulative probability of not switching to the active treatment at time t .  Unfortunately, the PROC PHREG procedure does not allow to specify time-dependent weights. Therefore one needs to divide the follow-up time into discrete time intervals and fit the above model using the PROC GENMOD procedure which allows time-dependent weights.

The case weights are estimated using the IPCW scheme for the probability of switching in the Octreotide  LAR  arm.  In  the  IPCW,  the  probability  of  not  switching  is  modeled  using  two separate logistic regression models as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The first logistic regression model (i.e., the nominator model) uses only the baseline covariate information to describe the probability of switching. The second logistic regression model (i.e., the denominator model) uses both baseline covariate information and time-dependent covariate information.  The  estimation  of  these  stabilized  weights  can  easily  be  done  with  the  PROC LOGISTIC procedure in SAS.

Note that the estimation of the stabilized weights is only needed in the Octreotide LAR arm. In the active treatment arm we set the stabilized weights to 1 for all subjects and for all discrete time periods.

This type of weighting effectively creates, for a risk set at time t, a pseudo-population in which ) ( u L i no  longer  predicts  the  receipt  of  active  treatment  at  time  t  (that  is, ) ( u L i is  not  a confounder). If we can be comfortable assuming that after having modeled the dependence of the  subsequent treatment ) ( u A i with the stabilized weights then under this assumption of no unmeasured  confounders,  the  coefficient 1 γ of ) ( u A i in  the  marginal  structural  Cox  model represents the causal association between the receipt of active treatment and mortality on the log-hazard ratio scale.

Note:  For  the  estimation  of  the  stabilized  weights  and  the  discrete  version  of  the  marginal structural Cox model one has to model the time-dependent intercepts using either a smooth function of time, such as a cubic spline or by combining time intervals. Otherwise the estimation may not be possible and also the asymptotic theory may break down.

## 5.5 Determination of missing adequate assessments

The term 'missing adequate assessment' refers to assessments that are not done or for which the overall lesion response is 'NE'. 'Missing adequate assessment' will also be referred to as 'missing assessment'.

The PFS censoring and event date options depend on the presence and the number of missing tumor assessments.

An exact rule to determine whether there are no, one or two missing TAs is therefore needed. This rule is based on the interval between the last adequate tumor assessment (LATA) date and the  event  date.  The  scheduled  date  of  tumor  assessments  (in  weeks  from  randomization), protocol specified window for tumor assessments, and the thresholds for LATA that belong to a visit can be found in Table 5.5-1 below.

Table 5.5-1 Schedule for tumor assessment and time windows

| Assessment schedule   | Schedule week - 1 week   | Schedule week (weeks from randomization)   | Schedule week + 1 week   | Threshold (weeks)*   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Baseline              | N/A                      | N/A                                        | N/A                      | N/A                  |

| Week 24               | 23                       | 24                                         | 23                       | 28                   |
| Week 36               | 35                       | 36                                         | 37                       | 42                   |
| Week 48               | 47                       | 48                                         | 49                       | 54                   |
| Week 60               | 59                       | 60                                         | 61                       | 66                   |
| Week 72               | 71                       | 72                                         | 73                       | 78                   |
| Week 72+12x**         | 71+12x                   | 72+12x                                     | 73+12x                   | 78+12x               |

* The mid-point between current and next visit (except for baseline) and the upper limit for LATA to be matched to a certain scheduled assessment, e.g., if LATA is at Week 21, this is after the threshold for Week 16, and before that for Week 24, so the matching scheduled assessment is Week 24.
- ** For all scheduled assessments after week 72, such as Week 84 (x = 1), Week 96 (x = 2), etc...

To calculate the number of missing tumor assessments, the LATA before an event is matched with  a  scheduled  tumor  assessment  using  the  time  window  in  the  table  above  (essentially whichever scheduled assessment it is closest to).  Two thresholds, D1 and D2 are calculated for that scheduled assessment based on the protocol-specified scheduled and windows:

- An event after LATA+D1 will be considered as having ≥ 1 missing assessment
- An event after LATA+D2 will be considered as having ≥ 2 missing assessments

Since there is a change of schedule for tumor assessments at Week 16 and Week 24, D1 and D2 are defined differently depending on when LATA happens.

Rule 1: if LATA happens before Week 16 (if LATA is at baseline, then LATA starts at Day 1)

- D1 = 16 weeks + 14 days = 126 days
- D2 = 16 weeks + 8 weeks + 14 days = 182 days

## Rule 2: if LATA occurs between Week 16 and Week 24

- D1 = 8 weeks + 14 days = 70 days
- D2 = 8 weeks + 12 weeks + 14 days = 154 days

## Rule 3:  if LATA occurs from Week 24 onward

- D1 = 12 weeks + 14 days = 98 days
- D2 = 12 weeks + 12 weeks + 14 days = 182 days

The  date  of  next  scheduled  assessment  is  defined  as  the  date  of  the  late  adequate  tumor assessment plus the protocol specified time interval for assessments.  The protocol specified time interval for tumor assessments is captured in the above table (± 1 week).

## Summary

Background There are currently no standard first-line treatment options for patients with higher grade 2-3, welldi/uniFB00erentiated, advanced, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. We aimed to investigate the e/uniFB03cacy and safety of first-line [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate) treatment.

Methods NETTER-2 was an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, superiority, phase 3 trial. We enrolled patients (aged ≥15 years) with newly diagnosed higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 &gt;20% and ≤55%), somatostatin receptor-positive (in all target lesions), advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours from 45 centres across nine countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. We used interactive response technologies to randomly assign (2:1) patients to receive four cycles (cycle interval was 8 weeks ± 1 week) of intravenous ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus  intramuscular  octreotide  30  mg  long-acting  repeatable  (LAR)  then  octreotide  30  mg  LAR  every  4  weeks (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group) or high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR every 4 weeks (control group), stratified by neuroendocrine tumour grade (2 vs 3)  and  origin  (pancreas vs other).  Tumour  assessments  were  done  at  baseline,  week  16,  and week 24, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded, independent, central radiology assessment. We did the primary analysis at 101 progression-free survival  events  as  the  final  progression-free  survival  analysis.  NETTER-2  is  registered  with  ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03972488, and is active and not recruiting.

Findings Between Jan 22, 2020, and Oct 13, 2022, we screened 261 patients, 35 (13%) of whom were excluded. We randomly assigned 226 (87%) patients (121 [54%] male and 105 [46%] female) to the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group (n=151 [67%]) and control group (n=75 [33%]). Median progression-free survival was 8·5 months (95% CI 7·7-13·8) in the control group and 22·8 months (19·4-not estimated) in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group (stratified hazard ratio 0·276 [0·182-0·418]; p&lt;0·0001). During the treatment period, adverse events (of any grade) occurred in 136 (93%) of 147 treated patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and 69 (95%) of 73 treated patients in the control group. There were no study drug-related deaths during the treatment period.

Interpretation First-line ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide LAR significantly extended median progression-free survival (by 14 months) in patients with grade 2 or 3 advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate should be considered a new standard of care in first-line therapy in this population.

## Introduction

Radioligand therapy delivers cytotoxic radiation directly to the tumour and, unlike most other systemic therapies, adverse events are generally minimal. 1 [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-DOTATATE  (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate)  is  a  ¹⁷⁷Lu-labelled  somatostatin analogue that binds to somatostatin receptors, 2 which are highly expressed in neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) and have  been  used  diagnostically  and  therapeutically  for decades. 3 The  groundbreaking  phase  3  NETTER-1  trial established the e/uniFB03cacy and safety of ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide  30  mg  long-acting  repeatable  (LAR)  for  the treatment of patients with advanced somatostatin receptor-positive  grade  1  or  grade  2  midgut  NETs  who had progressed on somatostatin analogues. 4,5

## Research in context

## Evidence before this study

In 2017, grade 3 well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumours were formally classified as a separate entity from the poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas by WHO. Following the phase 3 PROMID and CLARINET studies, somatostatin analogues are the recognised first-line treatment for advanced grade 1-2 (Ki67 &lt;10%) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours and the role of platinum-based chemotherapy is generally accepted for neuroendocrine carcinomas, but there are limited robust data to support first-line treatment options for patients with advanced higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 &gt;20% and ≤55%) well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. To our knowledge, at the time of the NETTER-2 study design, no randomised phase 3 studies had been done in this population of patients with newly diagnosed, advanced or metastatic disease. This represents an unmet need and has been identified as an evidence gap in treatment guidelines. The pivotal, phase 3, NETTER-1 study showed that treatment with the radioligand therapy [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate) plus best supportive care (octreotide 30 mg long-acting repeatable [LAR]) provided a significant increase in progression-free survival to patients with progressive midgut grade 1-2 neuroendocrine tumours compared with patients treated with high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR and led to regulatory approvals for ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate.

analogues  for  almost  all  patients  with  low-grade  and intermediate-grade  (grade  1-2)  gastroenteropancreatic NETs. 6-8 Two  phase  3,  randomised,  placebo-controlled trials  (CLARINET 9   and  PROMID 10 )  have  established somatostatin analogues as standard of care in grade 1-2 NETs.  The  CLARINET  study  included  patients  with lower  grade  2  NETs  (Ki67  &lt;10%),  and  excluded  higher grade  2  NETs  (Ki67  ≥10%). 9 Historically,  high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms were universally described as poorly di/uniFB00erentiated  and  often  thought to be similar to small-cell  malignancies.  In  2017,  grade  3  well-di/uniFB00erentiated  NETs  were  formally  recognised  by  WHO  as  a distinct entity from  the  poorly  di/uniFB00erentiated  neuroendocrine carcinomas. There is a paucity of high-quality evidence  with respect  to  gastroenteropancreatic-NET treatments, especially for higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 &gt;20% and ≤55%) in the firstline setting. 11 In patients with Ki67 greater than 55%, the role  of  platinum-based therapy is generally accepted, 12,13 but no randomised phase 3 studies have yet investigated the most appropriate treatment strategy for these patients. 6,12 The  lack of a defined first-line therapy represents an unmet  need  for  these patients with metastatic  disease.  Retrospective  analyses  of  treatment outcomes  for  patients  with  grade  3  well-di/uniFB00erentiated gastroenteropancreatic  NETs  have  reported  on  various therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy,

## Added value of this study

NETTER-2 is the first randomised trial in any metastatic solid tumour to investigate a radioligand therapy in a first-line metastatic setting. Among patients with higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 &gt;20% and ≤55%) well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg LAR showed a significant progression-free survival benefit versus high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR (median progression-free survival 22·8 months vs 8·5 months), with a high and durable response (overall response rate 43%; median duration of response 23·3 months) without deterioration in quality of life. Our results will help to fill the evidence gap for high-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours that has been highlighted in treatment guidelines and aid treatment decision making for these patients who currently have a worse prognosis compared with patients with lower-grade disease.

## Implications of all the available evidence

NETTER-2 provides the first robust, randomised, phase 3 data for patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. These results have clinical practice-changing implications and support the use of ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate earlier within the disease course of higher grade 2-3 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours.

high-dose somatostatin analogues, targeted therapy, radio  ligand therapy, and local therapies, highlighting the need for robust, prospective, randomised data to inform optimal treatment selection. 14,15

We present the primary results of the ongoing phase 3 NETTER-2  trial,  which  aimed  to  investigate  whether ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg LAR, at the same dose and schedule as established in the NETTER-1 trial, 4 would prolong progression-free survival compared with high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR, in patients with newly diagnosed, advanced higher grade 2-3, well-di/uniFB00erentiated gastroenteropancreatic NETs.

## Methods

## Study design and participants

NETTER-2 was an international, multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, superiority, open-label study done at 45  centres  in  nine  countries  across  North  America, Europe, and Asia. Eligible patients were aged 15 years or older with metastasised or locally advanced, histologically proven, higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 &gt;20% and ≤55%), well-di/uniFB00erentiated gastroenteropancreatic  NETs  that  were  considered  inoperable and had been diagnosed within 6 months before screening. Histological confirmation and Ki67 assessment were done locally by each study site. Cytology was not an acceptable method of gastroenteropancreatic-NET

diagnosis in this study. Patients were required to have a Karnofsky Performance Scale score of at least 60, bodyweight greater than 40 kg at screening, and somatostatin  receptor  expression  on  all  target  lesions, assessed by any somatostatin receptor imaging modality, within  3  months  before  randomisation.  Somatostatin receptor  uptake  was  scored  according  to  a  visual  semiquantitative scale. 16 Eligible patients were required to have an  uptake  score  of  3  (greater  than  liver  but  lower  than spleen) or 4 (greater than spleen). We excluded patients with creatinine clearance below 40 mL/min. Patients were also  ineligible  if  they  had  received  any  previous  peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, hepatic artery embolisation, or radiofrequency ablation for gastroenteropancreatic NETs.  Previous  systemic  therapy  for  gastroenteropancreatic NETs was not allowed unless it was administered for less than 1 month and not within 12 weeks before randomisation.  Patients  who  had  received  short-term (&lt;6 months) somatostatin analogues with no evidence of progression  were  eligible  for  enrolment.  Full  eligibility criteria  are  listed  in  the  protocol  (appendix  2).  Patients self-reported sex data (female  or male). All patients provided written informed consent.

The  trial  protocol  was  approved  by  the  institutional review  board  or  independent  ethics  committee  at  each participating  centre.  The  trial  was  done  in  accordance with  the  principles  of  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki,  the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and all applicable regulations. The protocol, with amendments, is available in appendix 2. No changes occurred to the methods after the study  commencement.  NETTER-2  is  registered  with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03972488.

## Randomisation and masking

We  used  interactive  response  technologies  (web  and voice;  Calyx,  Nottingham,  UK)  to  randomly  assign patients  (2:1)  to  the  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  group  or  control

group  stratified  by  tumour  grade  (2 vs 3)  and  tumour origin (pancreas vs other). We chose a 2:1 randomisation design to increase patients' chances of receiving ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate. To minimise a potentially high dropout rate in the control group, patients were o/uniFB00ered to cross over to ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate after centrally confirmed radiological progression. The randomisation list contained  240  pre-allocated  records  for  each  of  the four strata in the study (960 records in total). The first

Table 1: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (full analysis set)

patient  in  a  specific  stratum  was  assigned  the  first randomisation entry from the randomisation schedule pre-allocated to that stratum. Subsequent patients in the same  stratum  were  assigned  to the next available randomisation entry from the randomisation schedule pre-allocated to that stratum. We used a block size of six within  each  stratum.  Forced  randomisation  was  not allowed in this study. Tumour grade and origin are both important prognostic factors for gastro  entero  pancreatic NETs and thus were used as stratification factors. 17,18 The trial was open label, so masking of treatments was not applicable.

## Procedures

Patients were randomly assigned to receive ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg LAR or high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR (control group; appendix 1 p 3). In the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group, four cycles of ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate (7·4 GBq [200 mCi]) were  administered  intravenously  over  30  min  every 8 weeks (cumulative dose 29·6 GBq [800 mCi]). For renal protection,  an  intravenous  infusion  of  2·5%  lysinearginine amino acid solution was started 30 min before ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate infusion and continued for 4 h. 19 Octreotide 30 mg LAR was administered intramuscularly after  each  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  infusion  every  8  weeks  until completion of four ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate cycles, and then every 4 weeks. In the control group, octreotide 60 mg LAR was administered intramuscularly every 4 weeks. We assessed tumours  in  both  groups  at  baseline,  week  16,  and week  24, and then every 12 weeks  until centrally confirmed  disease  progression  or  death.  Somatostatin receptor imaging was not required for follow-up imaging. European Organisa  tion for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires  (EORTC QLQ-C30)  were  completed  by  patients  every  12  weeks from initiation of treatment until end of treatment. We assessed  safety  throughout  the  trial,  including  adverse events and laboratory toxicities (graded according to the National Cancer Insti  tute Common Terminology Criteria for  Adverse  Events  [CTCAE]  version  5.0).  Randomised treatment was allowed to continue until centrally confirmed disease progression or treatment discontinuation for another reason. Patients with disease progression  were  able  to  enrol  for  post-progression crossover (control group) or re-treatment (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group) upon meeting protocol criteria.

## Outcomes

The  primary  endpoint  was  progression-free  survival, defined as time from randomisation to first-line progression (as assessed by independent blinded central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours [RECIST] version 1.1 20 ) or death from any cause. Key secondary endpoints were objective response rate,  defined  as  the  rate  of  best  overall  response  of complete or partial response (as assessed by independent central  review  according  to  RECIST  1.1),  and  time  to

deterioration by 10 points from baseline in quality-of-life (QoL) scores for global health status, diarrhoea, fatigue, and  pain  as  measured  by  EORTC  QLQ-C30.  Other secondary endpoints were disease control rate, duration of response, safety, and overall survival. The assessment timing of patient outcomes corresponds to the schedule described  in  the  protocol  (appendix  2).  The  NETTER-2 study  is  ongoing  for  long-term  patient  follow-up  and overall survival analysis.

## Statistical analysis

The statistical analysis plan is available in appendix 3. We did the primary analysis at 101 progression-free survival events as the final progression-free survival analysis. We estimated that 99 progression-free survival events would be required to achieve 90% power using a one-sided logrank test at the overall 2·5% level of significance, to detect a  50%  reduction  in  hazard  rate,  corresponding  to  a doubling  of  median  progression-free  survival  from  an assumed 15 months for the control group to 30 months for  the  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  group.  These  assumptions  were based  on  the  results  from  NETTER-1  (progression-free survival  was  28·4  months  with  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate). 19 We conservatively  selected  a  hazard  ratio  (HR)  of  0·5  and, therefore,  a  progression-free  survival  of  15  months  for control was used for the sample size calculations. Assuming that enrolment would continue for approximately 22·2 months at a rate of ten patients per month and a 15% dropout rate by the time of primary progression-free survival analysis, we  estimated  that approximately 222 patients would need to be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate versus control groups.

To  control  for  the  overall  type  I  error,  we  tested  the primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  hierarchically  at the  time  of  the  primary  analysis.  The  order  of  the hypothesis testing was progression-free survival followed by objective response rate, time to deterioration in QoL by  EORTC  QLQ-C30  for  global  health  scale,  time  to deterioration  for  diarrhoea,  time  to  deterioration  for fatigue, and time to deterioration for pain. An endpoint would  be  tested  only  if  all  endpoints  tested  before  it showed statistical significance.

We used the full analysis set for e/uniFB03cacy analyses and summary for demographic and baseline characteristics, which  comprised  all  randomly  assigned  patients,  and patients  were  analysed  according  to  the  randomised treatment. All safety analyses were based on the safety set,  which  included  all  patients  who  received  at  least one  administration  of  study  treatment.  We  compared progression-free survival using a log-rank test stratified by  randomisation  stratification  factors  (tumour  grade and  origin).  We  calculated  the  rank  statistic  and  its variance separately for each stratum, then calculated the final statistic as the sum of rank statistics from all four strata divided by the square root of the sum of variances from all four strata, and compared the result with the normal distribution to obtain the p value. We estimated the  survival  distribution  of  progression-free  survival using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method.  We  estimated  HRs with 95% CIs using a stratified Cox model. We compared objective response rate between treatment groups, and the corresponding odds ratio along with 95% CIs was calculated using the stratified Cochran-MantelHaenszel method. We analysed time to deterioration in QoL using the same method as progression-free survival.  Unless  specified  otherwise,  we  summarised categorical  data  as  n  (%)  and  continuous  data  as median (IQR).

All safety analyses were done in the safety set, which included all patients who received at least one administration of study treatment, and patients were analysed according to the study treatment received. We summarised adverse events by number and percentage of patients having at least one adverse event by preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (version 26.0) and CTCAE (version 5.0). In the AE  summary  tables,  patients  with  multiple  CTCAE grades  for  the  same  preferred  term  were  summarised under  the  maximum  CTCAE  grade  recorded  for  the event.

had  grade  2  NETs  and  79  (35%)  had  grade  3  NETs. Two  (1%)  patients  had  locally  advanced  unresectable disease;  the  remaining  224  (99%)  patients  had  distant metastatic  disease.  Most  patients  had  liver  metastases (203 patients [90%]), followed by lymph node metastases in 135 patients (60%), bone metastases in 55 patients (24%), and peritoneal metastases in 35 patients (15%).

Tumour somatostatin receptor uptake score was 3 in 81 (36%) patients and 4 in 145 (64%) patients, as per local assessment (table 1). The median time since initial diagnosis was 1·9 months (IQR 1·3-3·7).

In total, 129 (88%) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group received  all  four  cycles  of  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  (table  2).  The median  dose  per  cycle  was  7·3  GBq  (IQR  7·2-7·5; 198 mCi), with a median cumulative dose of 29·2 GBq (28·0-29·8; 789 mCi; table 2). Patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group remained on study treatment (¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg  LAR) for a median  of  71·1 weeks  (47·9-100·0)  compared  with 40·3 (21·0-64·1) weeks for the control group (table 2). At the  cuto/uniFB00  date  of  the  primary  analysis  (July  20,  2023), 78  (52%)  patients  remained  on  study  treatment  in  the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and 15 (20%) remained on octreotide 60 mg LAR in the control group. The median duration of patient follow-up from randomisation to data cuto/uniFB00 was 23·2 months (16·4-28·8).

The study met its primary objective of progression-free survival. At data cuto/uniFB00,  progression-free survival events had occurred in 55 (36%) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group  and  46  (61%)  in  the  control  group.  The  median progression-free survival, as per blinded central assessment according to RECIST 1.1, was 22·8 months (95% CI 19·4-not  estimated  [NE])  in  the  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  group versus 8·5 months (7·7-13·8) in the control group. We found a reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by around 72%  in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group compared with the control group (HR for progressionfree survival with ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate vs control 0·276 [0·182-0·418];  p&lt;0·0001;  figure  2A).  The  progressionfree survival benefit observed in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group was consistent across all prespecified subgroups (figure  2B).  Progression-free  survival  results  based  on local tumour response assessment by investigators were in  agreement with the centrally reviewed data (median progression-free survival 22·6 months [17·7-NE] in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and 8·2 months [5·6-11·1] in the control group).

The objective response rate was significantly higher in the  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  group  (43·0%  [95%  CI  35·0-51·3]) than  in  the  control  group  (9·3%  [3·8-18·3])-ie,  an improvement of 33·7% (23·4-44·0) and a stratified odds ratio of 7·81 (3·32-18·40; p&lt;0·0001; table 3). Eight  (5%)  patients  in  the  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  group  had  a complete  response  versus  none  in  the  control  group (table 3). The median duration of response was 23·3 months (18·4-NE) based on 65 responders in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  group  and  was  NE  (2·3-NE)  with  seven responders in the control group. The disease control rate as assessed by central review was higher in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group (90·7% [84·9-94·8]) compared with the control group (66·7% [54·8-77·1]).

Overall  survival  data  were  immature  at  the  time  of primary progression-free survival analysis. Median overall  survival  was  not  reached  for  either  treatment group,  and  we  found  no  di/uniFB00erence  in  overall  survival between treatment groups at the time of follow-up. By the cuto/uniFB00  date,  36  (48%)  patients  in  the  control  group  had progressed and crossed over to ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate treatment (n=29 during the crossover phase) or received ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate or ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatoc (n=7 during the follow-up phase), which might have confounded the overall survival results in addition to the data immaturity. Overall survival monitoring  is  ongoing  in  the  long-term  follow-up  and will be analysed at the final analysis.

We found no significant di/uniFB00erence between treatment groups  for the  key  secondary  endpoint  of  time  to deterioration  in  QoL,  as  per  EORTC  QLQ-C30  scores (appendix 1 p 4).

Overall, 136 (93%) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and 69 (95%) in the control group experienced an adverse event in the randomised treatment period (ie, up to the last randomised study treatment date plus 30 days), with the most common (≥20% in either group) being nausea (40 [27%] vs 13  [18%]), diarrhoea (38 [26%] vs 25 [34%]), and  abdominal  pain  (26  [18%] vs 20  [27%];  table  4; appendix 1 p 5). Adverse events of grade 3 or worse were observed in 52 (35%) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group and  20  (27%)  in  the  control  group,  with  the  most common (&gt;3% in either group) being lymphocyte count decreased (eight [5%] vs 0),  gamma-glutamyltransferase increased  (seven  [5%] vs two  [3%]),  small  intestinal obstruction (5 [3%] vs 0), and abdominal pain

(four [3%] vs three [4%]; table 4; appendix 1 p 5). Adverse events  of  special  interest  of  CTCAE  grade  3  or  worse occurred in three (2%; leukopenia), one (&lt;1%; anaemia), and three (2%; thrombocytopenia) patients in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group versus 0 (leukopenia), one  (1%;  anaemia),  and  0  (thrombocytopenia)  in  the control  group  (table  5).  One  case  of  myelodysplastic syndrome was observed in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group by the time of data cuto/uniFB00 (at approximately 14 months from the first dose).

Six  deaths  occurred  during  the  randomised  treatment period  (two  in  the  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  group  and  four  in  the control group), all attributed to disease progression under study.  Discontinuation  rates  due  to  adverse  events  were low for ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate (three [2%]) and for octreotide LAR (five  [3%]  in  the  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  group  and  two  [3%]  for octreotide LAR in the control group; table 4). Few patients required dose reduction (three [2%] vs one [1%]) and the frequency of dose interruptions was similar in both groups (23 [16%] vs 11 [15%]).

## Discussion

NETTER-2 is the first phase 3 study to report results for radioligand therapy administered first line to patients in any  cancer  population.  It  is  also  the  first  randomised

Table 5: Adverse events of special interest during the randomised treatment period (safety set)

study  of  any  therapy  for  patients  with  grade  3  welldi/uniFB00erentiated gastroenteropancreatic NETs. In this study, patients with newly diagnosed higher grade 2-3, somatostatin receptor-positive, metastatic, gastroenteropancreatic  NETs  were  shown  to  significantly  benefit from  radioligand  therapy.  The  study  met  its  primary objective, with ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide 30 mg LAR reducing  the  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death  by around 72% compared with high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR. Consistent benefit was observed across all subgroups, including grade 2-3 NETs, and pancreatic as well  as  non-pancreatic  primary  origin.  In  this  patient population with grade 2-3 NETs, the objective response rate  was  43·0%  (one  of  the  highest  reported  in  the literature)  with  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  plus  octreotide  30  mg LAR compared with 9·3% for octreotide 60 mg LAR. No new  safety  concerns  were  observed.  Myelodysplastic syndrome  is  a  recognised  risk  of  radioligand  therapy with ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate. 19,21 In this study, one case of myelodysplastic syndrome was observed in the ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate group. However, the follow-up time was limited at the time of primary analysis; long-term safety follow-up and data collection on secondary haematological malignancies are ongoing.

Before  this  study,  little  evidence  existed  to  support treatment  decisions  in  this  patient  population,  and outcomes  were  generally  poor.  Although  somatostatin analogues  have  been  used  as  first-line  treatment  for advanced grade 1-2 gastroenteropancreatic NETs (Ki67  &lt;10%)  following  the  phase  3  PROMID 10 and CLARINET studies, 9,22 such robust data do not exist for higher  grade  2  tumours  (Ki67  ≥10%)  or  grade  3  welldi/uniFB00erentiated  NETs. 23 Small  retrospective  studies 14,15,24,25 have reported median progression-free survival durations of 4-8 months in patients with grade 3 NETs treated  with  first-line  somatostatin  analogues.  Other potential  options  for  higher  grade  2-3  NETs  include alkylating chemo  therapy regimens, such as 5-fluorouracil plus strepto  zotocin and capecitabine plus temozolomide. 8,15 Multicentre, retrospective analyses of temozolomide regimens for grade 3 NETs have shown response  rates  between  27·3%  and  51·0%. 26,27 All  of these retrospective analyses were done after the design and  initiation  of  NETTER-2,  and  complement  the evidence  presented  here  to  aid  in  treatment  decisions for patients with higher grade 2 or 3 gastroenteropancreatic  NETs.  Although  there  is  no  defined standard of care and  robust data for this patient population, randomised data in patients with progressive  pancreatic  lower-grade  NETs  (Ki67  cuto/uniFB00 ≤20%) showed a response rate of 40% with capecitabine plus temozolomide (phase 2  ECOG-ACRIN  E2211 study). 28 The  60  mg  dose  of  octreotide  in  the  control group  was  selected  following  the  NETTER-1  study design, which was developed following guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration. The high dose of octreotide did not have notable side-e/uniFB00ects, suggesting that this regimen is well tolerated. 4 According  to  guidelines, 6 somatostatin  analogues  may be  used  in  high-grade  gastro  enteropancreatic  NETs, according to individual patient characteristics. Considering that all recruited patients in NETTER-2 had a high level of somatostatin receptor expression, this choice is rational.

In  our  study,  time  to  deterioration  in  QoL  was  not significantly  di/uniFB00erent  between  the  treatment  groups. This finding is perhaps not surprising given that patients in  both  groups  received  a  backbone  of  somatostatin analogue therapy. Lack of QoL detriment with treatment by a radioligand therapy compared with a generally welltolerated somatostatin analogue is encouraging.

Until NETTER-2, no randomised studies had investigated  first-line  radioligand  therapy  for  any  solid tumour. The data from NETTER-2 add to evidence that early  molecular  imaging  could  help  optimise  treatment selection and sequencing for patients with somato  statin receptor-positive primary tumours of gastroenteropancreatic origin.

Our study has some limitations. Because of di/uniFB00erences in administration methods between treatments, and the need for radiation-exposure precautions, this study was designed to be open label. Bias was mitigated through the blinded central review of imaging data. Although this study  was  open  to  patients  aged  15  years  or  older,  no accrual of adolescent patients aged 15-17 years occurred; therefore, these data relate to adults only. Relative e/uniFB00ectiveness  to  other  available  therapies,  sequencing, cost-e/uniFB00ectiveness, and access issues should all be considered in future research.

Radioligand therapy is a promising new frontier in the treatment of cancers, which has previously been limited to surgery and systemic therapy. Our results will help to fill  the  evidence gap for high-grade gastroenteropancreatic NETs that has been highlighted in treatment guidelines. 6,12 The significant improvement in progression-free survival and  response  with  ¹⁷⁷Lu-Dotatate  plus  octreotide  LAR compared with somatostatin analogues alone was observed  across  tumour  site  and  grade  and  will  have clinical  practice-changing  implications  in  support  of first-line  radioligand  therapy  as  standard  of  care  for advanced higher grade 2 and grade 3, well-di/uniFB00erentiated, gastroenteropancreatic NETs.

The prognosis of patients with advanced high-grade (G3) digestive neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) is rather poor. The addition of immune checkpoint inhibition to platinum-based chemotherapy may improve survival. NICE-NEC (NCT03980925) is a single-arm, phase II trial that recruited chemotherapy-naive, unresectable advanced or metastatic G3 NENs of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or unknown origin. Patients received nivolumab 360mg intravenously (iv) on day 1, carboplatin AUC 5 iv on day 1, and etoposide 100 mg/m 2 /d iv on days 1 -3, every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for up to 24 months, disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the 12-month overall survival (OS) rate (H0 50%, H1 72%, β 80%, α 5%). Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), progressionfree survival (PFS), and safety. From 2019 to 2021, 37 patients were enrolled. The most common primary sites were the pancreas (37.8%), stomach (16.2%) and colon (10.8%). Twenty/uniFB01 ve patients (67.6%) were poorly differentiated carcinomas (NECs) and/or had a Ki67 index &gt;55%. The ORR was 56.8%. Median PFS was 5.7 months (95%CI: 5.1-9) and median OS 13.9 months (95%CI: 8.3-Not reached), with a 12-month OS rate of 54.1% (95%CI: 40.2-72.8) that did not meet the primary endpoint. However, 37.6% of patients were long-term survivors (&gt;2 years). The safety pro /uniFB01 le was consistent with previous reports. There was one treatment-related death. Nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with prolonged survival in over one-third of chemonaïve patients with G3 GEP-NENs, with a manageable safety pro /uniFB01 le.

High-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare and aggressive tumors with a very poor prognosis. Over 90% originate in the lung and only 3% are of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) origin 1,2 . The current standard of care still follows the treatment paradigm of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), a far more common G3 NEN, although emerging molecular and clinical data increasingly question this approach 3 . Platinum-based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide [EP]) is the standard /uniFB01 rst-line treatment for these patients, with objective response rates (ORR) of ~ 30% and a median overall survival (OS) of ~ 11 months 1 -4 . The development of more

effective treatment strategies is, therefore, highly needed for these patients.

The immune system plays a pivotal role in cancer prevention, development, and progression, and immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has changed the treatment paradigm of many cancer types over the past decade, including some high-grade NENs such as Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) 5 or SCLC 6,7 . Nevertheless, the role of immunotherapy remains controversial in G3 digestive NENs. Single-agent ICI with PD-1 or PD-L1 blockade is mostly ineffective in molecularly unselected, heavily pretreated patients with advanced GEP neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) (ORR &lt; 8%, progression-free survival [PFS] 1.8-4 months, OS 5.1-7 months), with the only exception of toripalimab, that reported an ORR of 20% in G3 NENs primarily of GEP origin 8 . ORR was signi /uniFB01 cantly higher in patients with the high mutational burden (TMB-H) or PD-L1 expression ≥ 10%, and about one-third of responders harbored ARID1A mutations 8 . In line with these observations, pembrolizumab also demonstrated ef /uniFB01 cacy in patients with TMB-H NENs 9 . Of note, TMB and PD-L1 expression, and other associated features predictive of response to immunotherapy, such as tumor-in /uniFB01 ltrating lymphocytes, are signi /uniFB01 cantly higher in high-grade NENs 10 -13 .

Dual PD-1 and CTLA-4 blockade have demonstrated increased ef /uniFB01 cacy compared with single-agent ICI in several tumor types, although more modest activity in pretreated G3 GEP NENs 14,15 . However, despite this modest activity, a subset of patients with pretreated G3 GEP NENs may achieve long-term survival 14 .

On the other hand, emerging evidence suggests that chemotherapy may be synergistic with ICI as it induces an immunogenic cell death that can prime antitumor immunity within an immunosuppressive microenvironment 16 -18 . This has been demonstrated in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced SCLC, as the addition of atezolizumab or durvalumab to platinum-based chemotherapy has demonstrated improved survival and is now the standard of care as /uniFB01 rst-line therapy 6,7 .

Here, we show the results of a phase II clinical trial that evaluated the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of nivolumab and carboplatin-etoposide in 37 patients with chemonaïve unresectable advanced or metastatic G3 NENs of GEP or unknown origin. The primary endpoint (12-month OS rate) was not met, but the combination was associated with an ORR of 56.8% and prolonged survival (&gt;2 years) in over one-third of patients with a manageable safety pro /uniFB01 le.

## Results

## Patients

Between 2019 and 2021, 38 patients were enrolled in the study. All patients received the study treatment and were evaluable for safety. Out of these, 37 (97.4%) met the eligibility criteria for study entry and were evaluated for ef /uniFB01 cacy. One patient (2.6%) with a nonneuroendocrine neoplasm was withdrawn from the study and was only considered for safety assessment.

The main patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The most common primary tumor sites were the pancreas ( N =15, 40.5%), stomach ( N =6, 16.2%), and colon ( N =4, 10.8%), followed by esophagus, small bowel and rectum (N = 2; 5.4% each). Six patients had unknown primaries (16.2%). The majority were poorly differentiated NECs( N =25, 67.6%), had a Ki-67 index greater than 55% ( N =25,67.6%), were stage IV at diagnosis ( N =35, 94.6%), had ≥ 2 metastatic sites ( N =27, 73%), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1-2 ( N =26, 70.3%) and elevated baseline chromogranin A ( N =27, 73%) or enolase ( N =21, 56.8%). PD-L1 expression couldbeassessedin35casesandwaspositiveintwo(5.4%overall,5.7% of assessed cases), one per CPS (10%) and TPS (1%) and the other one only per TPS (1%). Microsatellite instability was present in 1 of 14 evaluable patients (2,7% overall, 7,1% of assessed patients).

All patients had discontinued the study treatment at the time of the /uniFB01 nal analysis, 2 (5.4%) due to treatment completion (2 years) as scheduled and 35 (94.6%) prematurely. The primary reason for study discontinuation was disease progression, which occurred in 29 patients (78.4%). Three patients (8.1%) died during treatment due to disease progression, and one (2.7%) experienced a treatment-related death. Two patients (5.4%) discontinued the study treatment at the investigator ' s discretion.

## Treatment ef /uniFB01 cacy

With a median follow-up of 29.8 months (range: 22.2 -37.5+) in alive patients, the median OS was 13.9 months (95% CI: 8.3-NR) and the OS rates at 6, 12 and 24 months were 78.4% (95% CI: 66.2 -92.8), 54.1% (95% CI: 40.2 -72.8) and 37.6% (95% CI: 24.8 -57.1), respectively (Fig. 1A). The primary endpoint (12-m OS rate) was thus not met. OS did not signi /uniFB01 cantly differ by tumor differentiation or Ki-67 index, although the median OS was notably higher for G3 neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) versus NECs (23.3 vs. 13.9 months, HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 0.5 -3.5), and for Ki-67 ≤ 55 versus &gt;55% (17.6 vs. 11.7 months, HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.4 -2.4) (Supplementary Fig. 1). The patient with MSI tumor had long survival, being alive at data cut-off with an OS of 33.6+ months. The patient with CPS/TPS PD-L1 positive tumor was alive and had a survival of 22.8 months, while the patient PD-L1 positive per TPS only died after 2.2 months due to PD.

Multivariable analysis showed that tumor location was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with survival. OS was better for non-colorectal versus colorectal NENs (HR 0.34; 95% CI: 0.12-0.95) (Fig. 1B and supplementary Fig. 2).

The median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.1 -9) and the PFS rates at 6 and 12 months were 43.2% (95% CI: 29.9 -62.6) and 21.6% (95% CI: 11.7 -39.9), respectively (Fig. 1C). The median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.2 -not reached [NR]) and 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.9 -9.3) for NETs and NECs; and 5.4 months (95% CI: 2.7-NR) and 5.9 months (95% CI: 5.1 -9.3) for Ki-67 ≤ 55 and &gt;55%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Multivariable cox regression analysis revealed high baseline chromogranin A (CgA) levels were associated with a lower risk of progression (HR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09 -0.72) (Fig. 1D and supplementary Fig. 4).

Among the 37 patients evaluable for ef /uniFB01 cacy, ORR was 56.8% and disease control rate (DCR) 83.8% (Fig. 2A). Twenty-one patients (56.8%) had partial response (PR), 10 (27.0%) had stable disease (SD), and 3 (7.9%) had progressive disease (PD) as their best response. Three patients who died due to disease progression before the /uniFB01 rst tumor assessment were not evaluated for response but were considered as treatment failures and included in the denominator for all ORR and DCR calculations. Twenty-four patients (64.9%) experienced a reduction in tumor size from baseline, with sustained response for more than 12 months in /uniFB01 ve patients (13.5%) (Fig. 2B). One of the two patients with PD-L1-positive tumors and the patient with MSI tumor had sustained response. Characteristics of patients with long-term responses are detailed in Table 2. The median duration of response (DoR) was 6.4 months (range: 1.5 -27.7+). ORR signi /uniFB01 cantly differed by primary tumor site, with colorectal NENs having the worst ORR (ORR 16.7% vs 64.5%; p =0.02) (Fig. 2C). ORR did not signi /uniFB01 cantly differ by tumor differentiation or Ki-67 index, although ORR was numerically higher in patients with Ki-67 &gt; 55% (ORR 64% vs 41.7%) and in NECs versus NETs

The median duration of treatment was 3.5 months (95% CI: 3-3.7) for platinum-based chemotherapy and 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.8-7.1) for nivolumab. Twenty-three patients (57%) received 6 cycles of

Grade ≥ 3 toxicities occurred in 23 (60.5%) patients (Fig. 3, Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The most frequent grade ≥ 3 treatmentrelated adverse events were neutropenia (39.5%), febrile neutropenia (10.5%), anemia (7.9%), fatigue (7.9%) and thrombopenia (5.2%) (Fig. 3A). Most toxicities emerged and were more severe during the induction phase (Fig. 3B). The majority of immune-mediated adverse events were G1-2 (Supplementary Table 1). One patient (2.6%)

experienced grade 3 ALT increase and one patient had a grade 3 acute kidney injury considered immune-related; both resolved without sequelae. There was one treatment-related death, which occurred after the /uniFB01 rst cycle of therapy in the induction phase. The event was a grade 4 pancytopenia and esophageal mucositis, bacteremia due to Escherichia Coli , septic shock and severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding that led to a fatal outcome.

## Discussion

This phase II study evaluated the combination of an ICI and standard /uniFB01 rst-line chemotherapy in high-grade GEP NENs. Nivolumab in combination with carboplatin and etoposide achieved an ORR of 56.8%, a DCR of 83.8%, and a median survival of 13.9 months 3,19 -22 . Responses were profound and durable, with about one-third of responses maintained beyond 12 months and a 2-year OS rate of 37.6%. Although the primary endpoint of this trial was not met (1-year OS rate of 72%), the high proportion of long-term survivors is in our opinion particularly encouraging considering that our cohort was mostly composed of patients with multiple adverse prognostic features, such as poor histological differentiation (68%), Ki-67 index &gt; 55% (66%), stage IV at diagnosis (95%), ≥ 2 metastatic sites (74%), poor performance status (10.8% ECOG 2) and high baseline enolase levels (63%). In addition, our cohort had a low prevalence of molecular alterations predictive of response to immunotherapy, such as positive PD-L1 or MSI, and the majority presented liver involvement at study entry, which can co-opt immunetolerancemechanismstoinduceimmunotherapyresistance 23 .

The standard of care for patients with advanced or metastatic G3 GEP NENs is systemic chemotherapy. Cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with etoposide are the most widely used regimens, that yield ORR of 31%, DCR of 64%, and a median survival of 11 months, as reported in one of the benchmark studies, the NORDIC NEC 19 . Response to chemotherapy was lower in G3-low GEP NENs (ORR 15% versus 42% in NENs with Ki67 21 -55% versus ≥ 55%), although they had better survival compared to G3-high GEP NENs (14 versus 10 months, respectively). More recently, two randomized Asian trials that compared the combination of cisplatin and etoposide with cisplatin and irinotecan, showed similar ef /uniFB01 cacy for both regimens, with somewhat higher ORR (53-63%) than those reported in the NORDIC NEC study, but no improvement in OS (10.2 -12.5 months) 20,21 and a low rate of long-term survivors (2-year OS rate ≤ 20%). Another recent randomized trial in a Western population (ECOG ACRIN EA2142) compared platinum and etoposide versus CAPTEM in non-small cell G3 GEP-NENs (including NETs and NECs). This trial was closed for futility, concluding that CAPTEM wasnot associated with increased ef /uniFB01 cacy. It reported an ORR of 22%, a median PFS of 5.4 months, and a median OS of 10.6 months for the carboplatin and etoposide combination 22 . In this context, the results of our study combining ICI with /uniFB01 rst-line platinumbased chemotherapy are encouraging. However, it should be noted that different proportions of relevant prognostic features in study populations, particularly regarding tumor differentiation, Ki-67 index or primary tumor site, limit comparisons with benchmark studies.

ICI has been incorporated as the standard of care for other highgrade NENs (SCLC, MCC), although its use in G3 digestive NENs is still a matter of debate. Early trials conducted in heavily pretreated populations showed overall disappointing results. However, they suggest a potential role in certain molecularly selected subgroups, such as MSI/ dMMR, ARID1A-mutated, or TMB-H tumors 8,9,24 . Dual PD1/CTLA4 blockade showed promising preliminary activity in small cohorts of patients with high-grade NENs enrolled in two basket trials (DART SWOG1609andCA209-538) 25,26 andis in fact one of the recommended treatment options in the NCCN guidelines for extrapulmonary NECs progressed to /uniFB01 rst-line chemotherapy 27 . However, clinical trials speci /uniFB01 cally conducted in GEP NENs have shown more modest results. For instance, the DUNE trial that assessed durvalumab and tremelimumab in a cohort of G3 GEP NENs progressed to platinum-based /uniFB01 rst-line

therapy, reported an ORR of 9.1% and a 9-month OS rate of 36.1% 28 . Consistent with our study, outcomes did not substantially differ by tumor differentiation (NET vs. NEC) or Ki-67 index, and about onethird of patients were long-term survivors. In fact, the G3 GEP NEN cohort of the DUNE trial surpassed the pre-established OS futility threshold, which was the primary endpoint. Similar results were reported in the larger NIPINEC study (GCO-001), a randomized noncomparative trial that allocated patients with NECs, including 93 with advanced large-cell lung cancer and 92 with GEP, all having progressed to 1 or 2 prior lines of therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy, to receive nivolumab or nivolumab plus ipilimumab 15 . The combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab reached its primary endpoint of ORRat8weeks&gt;10%.DualICIinducedhigherORRinlungNECs(18.2%) than in GEP NECs (11.6%). Median PFS (1.9 months) and OS (5.8 months) were not encouraging, although further follow-up and molecular pro /uniFB01 ling are needed to identify whether a subset of patients may achieve long-term bene /uniFB01 t.

Chemotherapy may improve the immunological effects of ICIs as it induces an immunogenic cell death, reduces regulatory T-cell activity, and induces PD-L1 expression, and this synergy has in fact been demonstrated in the clinical setting 6,7 . Moreover, chemotherapy has short-term cytotoxic effects that may slow down tumor growth and allow enough time for ICI to induce/re-invigorate an effective antitumor immune response. Results are particularly encouraging in G3 GEP NENs of non-colorectal origin (ORR 70.8%), although small numbers and lack of control preclude de /uniFB01 nitive conclusions. Conversely, colorectal NENs showed limited bene /uniFB01 t from the combination of ICI with chemotherapy, with particularly poor outcomes in line with those reported by Sorbye et al. for /uniFB01 rst-line platinum/etoposide treatment in this subgroup of patients 29 . Other features associated with increased ORR were increased baseline CgA levels and poor histological differentiation, although these correlations did not reach statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. CgA levels have been classically associated with poor prognosis in GEP-NETs, mostly as they are related to tumor bulk 30,31 . Nevertheless, in the context of G3 NENs its prognostic role is more complex, as the lack of CgA expression may be associated with poorly differentiated, more aggressive tumors with a worse outcome. Consistently, CgA was associated in our study with signi /uniFB01 cantly improved PFS (median of 5.9 and 3.9 months for CgA ≥ 2 ULN vs &lt;2 ULN, respectively). More interestingly, CgA may play an immunomodulatory role as it is capable of boosting the innate immune system by inducing TNF α secretion and is correlated with immune cell in /uniFB01 ltration in chronic in /uniFB02 ammatoryconditionssuchaslymphocyticcolitis 32,33 . The potential interaction of CgA with the regulation of immune response deserves to be further explored. Regarding tumor differentiation, our observations and evidence from other trials suggest that NECs obtain greater bene /uniFB01 t from ICIs than NETs, possibly due to the higher mutational burden and enhanced neoantigen presentation of poorly differentiated NECs. In fact, 4 out of 5 long-term responders were NECs. However, a low proportion of PD-L1 expression was observed in our cohort (2 patients, 5.4%) and all patients with prolonged duration of response were PD-L1 negative. Similar observations were reported in the DUNE trail, where no correlation was found between PD-L1 expression and ef /uniFB01 cacy 28 .

The addition of nivolumab to standard chemotherapy did not reveal any safety concerns. Most frequent grade ≥ 3toxicities primarily occurred during the induction phase and were mainly associated to platinum-based chemotherapy (neutropenia (39.5%), febrile neutropenia (10.5%), anemia (7.9%), fatigue (7.9%) and thrombopenia (5.2%)). Immune-mediated adverse events were generally mild and

manageable. Treatment discontinuation rates were similar to those reported in previous studies, and primarily resulted from disease progression.

The main limitation of this trial is the fact that it was a nonrandomized study. The lack of a parallel control group restricts the ability to directly compare the treatment outcomes with a standard arm. In addition, the study sample size limits the statistical power to conduct exploratory clinical or molecular analysis to identify subgroups of patients that may obtain a greater bene /uniFB01 t, particularly relevant due to the heterogeneity of the study population in terms of primary tumor site and tumor differentiation. These limitations highlight the need for larger, controlled studies to validate our /uniFB01 ndings and further investigate the added value of combining an ICI with standard chemotherapy. Addressing these limitations, the S2101 (NCT05058651) phase II/III trial, currently underway, aims to enroll 189 patients with extrapulmonary NECs. It will speci /uniFB01 cally evaluate the impact of adding atezolizumab to standard chemotherapy (carboplatin/cisplatin plus etoposide) compared to chemotherapy alone. This study will help to determine the potential added value of combining ICIs with standard /uniFB01 rst-line chemotherapy in advanced extrapulmonary G3 NENs.

In conclusion, this study assessed the addition of ICIs to platinumbased chemotherapy in chemonaïve patients with advanced or metastatic G3 NENs of GEP or UK origin. Although the primary endpoint (12month OS rate) was not met, the high proportion of long-term survivors (37.6% OS rate at 2 years) is encouraging in the context of a highly aggressive disease. These /uniFB01 ndings justify further exploration in larger, randomized trials to more accurately assess the risk-bene /uniFB01 t balance of combining immunotherapy with platinum-based chemotherapy as a /uniFB01 rst-line treatment for patients with high-grade GEP-NENs. Translational studies will also be crucial to identify predictive biomarkers to improve the selection of patients who may bene /uniFB01 t the most from this therapeutic strategy.

## Methods

## Study design and participants

The NICE-NEC trial was a multicenter, single-arm, phase II clinical trial that recruited patients across 12 centers belonging to the Spanish Taskforce of Neuroendocrine Tumors (GETNE). Key inclusion criteria included histologically con /uniFB01 rmed, unresectable advanced or metastatic NENs of GEP or unknown primary origin, G3 (Ki-67 &gt; 20% or mitotic rate &gt;20 per 10 high-power /uniFB01 elds (HPF)), chemotherapy-naive status, measurable disease, adequate organ function, and an ECOG performance status of 0-2. Neither sex nor gender were considered to design the study but sex was registered as a relevant covariable for univariable and multivariable analysis. Sex was registered by investigators based on biological grounds. Gender was not registered. Available fresh or archived formalin/uniFB01 xed, paraf /uniFB01 n-embedded tumor tissue was required in those patients that provided additional (nonmandatory) consent for translational studies.

Paraganglioma, adrenal, thyroid, parathyroid, or pituitary endocrine tumors, and large or small cell NEC of the lung were excluded. Patients who had previously received ICI, had undergone organ transplantation, were on systemic chronic steroid therapy (&gt;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) or taking other immunosuppressive agents, or had received any investigational drug within 28 days prior to the start of the study treatment were also excluded. Additionally, patients with a known history or active/chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus or human immunode /uniFB01 ciency virus (HIV), or with other signi /uniFB01 cant infections requiring medication were not eligible for the trial.

The study protocol was approved by the competent authority in Spain and the Institutional Review Board of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre; ref number: 19/291. The /uniFB01 rst patient was enrolled on November 4th, 2019 and the last patient on January 26th, 2021. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. All participants provided written informed consent prior to study entry. Patients were not compensated for participating in the study. This study was registered at EudraCT (2019001546-18) on 2019-Aug-19 and www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03980925; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03980925) on 2019Jun-07.

## Treatment schedule

Theinvestigational treatment consisted of an initial induction phase of 6 cycles of nivolumab and chemotherapy, followed by maintenance treatment with nivolumab for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. During the induction phase, nivolumab 360 mg was administered intravenously (iv) on day 1, carboplatin AUC = 5 iv on day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m 2 /day iv on days 1-3, every 3 weeks. In the maintenance phase nivolumab 480 mg was administered iv on day 1, every 4 weeks for up to 2 years.

## Study endpoints and procedures

Clinical assessments were performed every 3 weeks during the induction phase and every 4 weeks thereafter until disease progression, death, or end of study due to unacceptable toxicity or consent withdrawal. These included the review of medical history, directed anamnesis (including adverse events assessment), physical examination (including ECOG PS, vital signs, height, and weight), laboratory tests (including tumor markers CgA and enolase), concomitant medication and treatment compliance. Tumor imaging assessments were performed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at baseline, every 8 weeks during the /uniFB01 rst year, andevery12weeksthereafter until disease progression was con /uniFB01 rmed, or the patients initiated an alternative treatment. CT, or MRI scans were assessed locally by investigators following both, RECIST 1.1, and irRECIST 1.1 criteria.

The primary objective of this study was the 12-month OS rate. OS was determined from the time of the initiation of the study treatment to the date of death from any cause.

Secondary endpoints included ORR, DCR, DoR, PFS, and safety. ORR was de /uniFB01 ned as the percentage of patients who achieved a complete (CR) or PR throughout the study period. DCR was de /uniFB01 ned as the percentage of patients achieving CR, PR, or SD. DoR was de /uniFB01 ned as the time elapsed from the date of the /uniFB01 rst documentation of an objective response (CR or PR) to the date of progressive disease. PFS was de /uniFB01 ned as the time elapsed from the /uniFB01 rst dose of the study treatment until the date of progressive disease or death, whichever occurred /uniFB01 rst. Safety was based on the assessment of AEs, clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and physical examinations. AEs and laboratory values were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v.5.0 (CTCAE). Pre-planned subgroup analyses were performed to explore potential signs of differential ef /uniFB01 cacy by most relevant clinical features, although the study was not powered for formal comparisons; therefore, all /uniFB01 ndings are exploratory in nature.

## PDL1 expression assessment

To assess the expression of PDL1, IHC was performed on whole formalin/uniFB01 xed paraf /uniFB01 n-embedded tissue specimens (FFPE) freshly cut tissue sections of 4μ m thickness using an automated stainer (Histocore Spectra ST Leyca Biosystems). The primary PDL1 antibody used was clone 22C3 (Agilent/Dako, PharmDx; Supplementary Table 3). For optimisation of the PD-L1 staining, samples from PD-L1-positive squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC) were included as external positive control.

Thirty/uniFB01 ve tumor samples that had at least 50-100 viable cells were considered adequate for PDL1 expression assessment. Immunostains were evaluated by pathologists blinded to the clinical data.

PDL1 combined positive score (CPS) was calculated as the proportion of PDL1-staining cells (tumor cells (TCs) and tumor-in /uniFB01 ltrating immune cells (ICs) with positive membranous staining of any intensity) relative to all viable tumor cells. PDL1 tumor proportion score (TPS) was calculated as the percentage of viable tumor cells showing partial or complete membrane staining at any intensity. A TPS/CPS &lt; 1% was considered negative.

## Characterization of mismatch-repair (MMR)/microsatellite instability (MSI)

MMR/MSI was determined in patients with available extra tumor tissue ( N =14). Two techniques were used to determine the MMR/MSI status: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). IHC staining for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 was performed on formalin/uniFB01 xed, paraf /uniFB01 n-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue blocks by standard automated staining methods performed in each Hospital (Supplementary Table 3). MMR IHC results were interpreted and reported by clinical pathologists. For the assessment of MSI status by PCR-based fragmentsizing test, /uniFB01 ve microsatellite mononucleotide loci, namely BAT25, BAT26, NR21, NR24, and MONO27, were analyzed using OncoMate MSI Dx Analysis System according to the manufacturer ' s protocol (REF: MD3140; https://www.promega.es/products/microsatellite-instabilitymsi-testing/clinical-msi-testing-ivd/oncomate-msi-dx-analysis-system/; Promega Corporation, Madrid, Spain). Brie /uniFB02 y, the 5 microsatellite markers were ampli /uniFB01 edusing a multiplex /uniFB02 uorescence PCR and subjected to capillary electrophoresis on SeqStudio Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scienti /uniFB01 c, Madrid, Spain). MSI was scored when at least 2 of 5 loci were unstable.

## Statistical analysis

Sample size was calculated using a two-sided one arm survival test (https://stattools.crab.org/Calculators/oneNonParametricSurvival.

htm) 34 . The study aimed for a statistical power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.05. The null hypothesis was based on historical controls and assumed a 12-month OS rate of 50%, while the alternative hypothesis proposed an OS rate of 72%. The accrual time for patient enrollment was 18 months, followed by a 12-month follow-up period. Considering a dropout rate of 10%, a /uniFB01 nal sample size of 38 patients was determined for the study.

Ef /uniFB01 cacy analysis was based on the full analysis set that included all enrolled eligible patients. The safety analysis set comprised all patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment including those who were ineligible or experienced disease progression or death before the /uniFB01 rst on-treatment scan.

Continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, standard deviation, range, and median). Frequency counts, and the percentage of subjects within each category were provided for categorical data. Response rates were estimated using 95% con /uniFB01 dence intervals (CI), or range (minimum to maximum values) intervals. Survival or time-to-event endpoints were estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and Cox regression analysis to obtain hazard ratios and CIs. Patients without documented progression or death by the time of the analysis were censored at the last date of tumor evaluation for PFS assessment. For OS assessment, patients without documented death were censored at the last date of follow-up. All statistical tests were considered two-tailed, and results with p &lt; 0.05 were considered signi /uniFB01 cant. Variables assessed in univariable subgroup analysis to explore potential signs of differential ef /uniFB01 cacy by most relevant clinical features included the following: primary tumor site, tumor differentiation, Ki-67 index, ECOG performance status, sex, age, chromogranin A, neurospeci /uniFB01 c enolase, and LDH. Multivariable regression models also assessed these variables to analyze their potential relationship with ef /uniFB01 cacy endpoints. To obtain the multivariable models, we employed the ' backward ' stepwise selection method, systematically eliminating non-signi /uniFB01 cant exploratory variables until a signi /uniFB01 cant set was achieved. In instances where a signi /uniFB01 cant set could not be reached, the last two remaining variables were included for analysis (see supplementary information for further details). All statistical analyses were performed with R and SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics Version 26, Armonk, NY). Figures and tables were generated using RStudio (Version 1.2.5033 2009-2019 RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA, US).

Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have not been shown to be active in well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), with response rates &lt; 5%. Lenvatinib is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor which binds to vascular endothelial growth factor and /uniFB01 broblast growth factor receptors and has demonstrated ef /uniFB01 cacy in pancreatic and gastrointestinal NETs [44% and 16% objective radiographic response rate (ORR), respectively]. The combination of antiangiogenic and CPI therapies can be synergistic. We therefore evaluated the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in well-differentiated gastrointestinal (GI) and thoracic NETs.

Patients and methods: A prospective, phase II trial evaluated patients with advanced GI/thoracic NETs (pancreatic NETs were excluded due to high response rate of lenvatinib monotherapy in this patient population), with evidence of progression within 8 months of study entry and at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. Patients received lenvatinib 20 mg daily and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or progression of disease. Primary endpoint was objective response rate, and an interim analysis was planned once 20 patients were enrolled. Four ORRs were required to continue enrollment.

Results: Twenty patients were enrolled on protocol from April 2021 to January 2022 (nine small intestine, /uniFB01 ve lung, two thymic, two unknown primary, one cecal, one presacral primaries). Two patients (10%) achieved a partial response (atypical lung and small intestinal primaries). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 8 months (95% con /uniFB01 dence interval 5.8-10.2 months). Twelve (60%) patients experienced probably or de /uniFB01 nitely associated grade 3 adverse events (10 hypertension). Fourteen patients (70%) required dose reductions or discontinued one of the medications. Two patients discontinued treatment before radiographic assessment.

Conclusions: The combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib did not show suf /uniFB01 cient response in patients with NETs to warrant continued enrollment on trial.

## INTRODUCTION

Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are characterized by a high level of vascularization as well as overexpression of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR). 1,2 Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) targeting VEGFR have demonstrated activity in advanced NETs. Sunitinib, an inhibitor of VEGFR subtypes 1-3 and plateletderived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo among patients with pancreatic NETs. 3 Parallel phase III studies of surufatinib, an inhibitor of VEGFR 1-3 as well as /uniFB01 broblast growth factor receptor (FGFR-1),

were conducted in China, enrolling patients with pancreatic and gastrointestinal (GI)/thoracic NETs. 4,5 Both trials demonstrated statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in PFS versus placebo. Other RTKIs, such as pazopanib, axitinib, and cabozantinib, have also shown evidence of activity in advanced pancreatic as well as GI and thoracic NETs, although a phase III trial of axitinib versus placebo in GI/thoracic NETs fell short of statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. 6-9 Among antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), lenvatinib stands out as demonstrating particularly high objective radiographic response rates (ORRs). Lenvatinib is an inhibitor of VEGFR 1-3, FGFR 1-4, PDGFR, and c-KIT. The single-arm phase II TALENT trial evaluated 111 patients in two cohorts: progressive pancreatic NETs (55 patients) or GI NETs (56 patients). 10 The ORR was 30%: 44% in the pancreatic NET cohort and 16% in the GI NET cohort. Median PFS was 15.7 months.

In addition to inhibiting angiogenesis, VEGF inhibitors may play a role in mediating antitumoral immune response. 11

VEGF induces the mobilization of regulatory T cells (Tregs) which can secrete immunosuppressive cytokines. 12 VEGFR inhibitors have been shown to stimulate dendritic cell antigen presentation, T-cell activation, and migration to tumor sites, and also to inhibit generation of Tregs along with immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor b . Thus, VEGFR TKIs can potentially reverse the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment.

Preclinical evidence of immunomodulation has provided the basis for investigating the combination of VEGFR inhibitors with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). Drugs targeting the programmed cell death protein (PD-1) receptor or its ligand (PD-L1) have shown minimal activity in welldifferentiated NETs with ORRs generally below 5%. 13-17 The very low median tumor mutation burden (TMB) and, consequently, low neoantigen presentation likely contribute to low response rates against well-differentiated NETs. Strategies to enhance immune response are therefore necessary, and combinations of CPIs with RTKIs are of particular interest.

Clinical indications of synergy between immune CPIs and RTKIs exist in other cancer types. 18-21 Keynote 146, a phase Ib/II study, evaluated pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib in certain solid tumors, establishing a recommended dose of lenvatinib 20 mg orally daily and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously (i.v.) every 3 weeks. 22 Based on particularly promising response rates in endometrial cancer patients [64% ORR in microsatellite instability (MSI)-high patients and 36% in microsatellite-stable patients], the phase III Keynote 775 study was launched to investigate lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab versus investigator-choice chemotherapy in patients with advanced endometrial cancer beyond /uniFB01 rst-line therapy. 23 A total of 827 patients [697 with mismatch repair-pro /uniFB01 cient (pMMR) and 130 with mismatch repair-de /uniFB01 cient disease] were randomized. Results showed a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in overall survival (OS) with pembrolizumab/lenvatinib both in the overall population (hazard ratio 0.62) and the pMMR population (hazard ratio 0.68), thus establishing the ef /uniFB01 cacy of this treatment combination.

To assess whether evidence of synergy between RTKI and VEGFR inhibitor exists in well-differentiated NETs, we designed a phase II study evaluating the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib. The primary endpoint selected was ORR given the dif /uniFB01 culty of interpreting PFS outcomes in a single-arm trial. Due to the high documented ORR of 40% with lenvatinib monotherapy in the GETNE study, pancreatic NETs were excluded from our trial, and the study population was restricted to well-differentiated NETs originating in the GI tract and thorax (lungs and thymus).

## PATIENTS AND METHODS

## Patient selection and eligibility

This study was an open-label, single-arm, phase II study of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in patients with welldifferentiated NETs. The protocol [NCT03290079; IND number (IND-Exempt): IND-135156] was approved by the

Advara institutional review board (Pro00023052) and was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice principles. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before any study-related procedures.

Subjects were eligible if they were adults (age /C21 18 years) with metastatic well-differentiated (grade 1-3 per World Health Organization 2020) NETs of primary lung, thymic, gastric, small bowel, colorectal, or unknown primary origin. 24,25 Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas and pancreatic primaries were not eligible for enrollment. Patient must have had evidence of radiographic disease progression per investigator assessment within 8 months of consent and had received a minimum of two prior lines of systemic therapy. There was no limit to number of prior lines of treatment, and concurrent therapy with somatostatin analogs was permitted in patients with hormonal syndromes. Other key eligibility criteria were measurable disease per RECIST 1.1, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of /C20 1, absolute neutrophil count /C21 1500 cells/ m l, platelets /C21 100 000 cells/ m l, hemoglobin /C21 9 g/dl, urine protein &lt; 30 mg/dl on urinalysis or /C20 1 g/24 h on 24-h urine protein, total bilirubin /C20 1.5 /C2 upper limit of normal (ULN), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase /C20 2.5 /C2 ULN or /C20 5 /C2 ULN for patients with liver metastases, albumin /C21 2.5 mg/dl, and international normalized ratio (INR)/prothrombin time /C20 1.5 /C2 ULN. Key exclusion criteria included a history of immunode /uniFB01 ciency or concurrent systemic steroid/immunosuppressive therapy use, prior therapy with any TKIs or anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agents, uncontrolled hypertension de /uniFB01 ned as blood pressure of &gt; 150/90 despite optimal medical management, history of thromboembolic events within 6 months of enrollment and/or use of anticoagulants requiring INR monitoring, and baseline prolongation of QTcF /C21 480 ms.

## Treatment and evaluation

Cycles were de /uniFB01 ned as 21 days ( /C6 3 days) for up to 35 cycles. Pembrolizumab was administered i.v. at a dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks and lenvatinib was orally administered at a dose of 20 mg once daily. Dose reductions of the lenvatinib were allowed in a stepwise fashion: 14 mg, 10 mg, and 8 mg. No dose reductions were permitted of the pembrolizumab; however, patients were eligible to continue monotherapy of either drug should they become intolerant to or experience unacceptable adverse events (AEs) requiring the discontinuation of one. Dose modi /uniFB01 cations for immune-related AE and lenvatinib-related AEs were outlined in detail in the protocol.

Baseline radiographic assessments of tumor burden (multiphasic computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans) were completed within 28 days of initiation of study treatment and repeated every 9 weeks from start of treatment for the /uniFB01 rst year, then every 12 weeks for the second year. RECIST version 1.1 was used for evaluation of primary endpoint of response rate. Optional archival tissue was collected and sent to QualTek for correlative analysis of

PD-L1 tumor expression, TMB, and microsatellite instability status.

## Sample size calculation

The primary endpoint of the trial was objective radiographic response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included PFS, duration of response per RECIST 1.1, OS, as well as safety and tolerability of the combination in this patient population, assessed per version 5.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. PFS was de /uniFB01 ned as the time from initial treatment to the /uniFB01 rst documented disease progression according to RECIST 1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs /uniFB01 rst. OS was de /uniFB01 ned as the time from initial treatment until death from any reason. Patients without an event were censored at last date seen. Exploratory objectives were to correlate radiographic response with PD-L1 tumor expression and presence of tumor-in /uniFB01 ltrating lymphocytes (TILs).

The study was a standard phase II study, utilizing a Simon two-stage design. The sample size calculation was based on the assumption that a true response of &gt; 38% would generate interest in a larger randomized study, where a response rate of &lt; 18% would not yield any further interest in this drug combination for this disease. Based on this, 35 patients were needed to test the hypothesis that the true response is 38% versus 18% with a power of 90% and type 1 error rate of 8%. Patients were to be accrued to the trial according to Simon ' s two-stage minimax design and 20 patients would be enrolled into stage 1. If four or more responses were observed, then another 15 patients were to be enrolled into stage 2. At the completion of the study, 10 or more responders out of 35 were needed to consider the statistical signi /uniFB01 cance of 8% met.

## Statistical analysis

The Kaplan e Meier method was used to estimate all timeto-event functions. PFS was de /uniFB01 ned as the time from start of treatment until progression of disease or death due to any cause. OS was de /uniFB01 ned as the time from start of treatment until death due to any cause, with patients censored at the date of last follow-up if still living. PFS estimates were to be calculated at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month timepoints, and OS would be noted at the median and 12-month timepoints. Exact 95% con /uniFB01 dence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each proportion of interest. Overall safety would be assessed by identifying the highest toxicity grade for each patient and further evaluated in select toxicities. Statistical analysis was carried out using IBM SPSS v26.

## RESULTS

## Patient population

A total of 20 patients were enrolled between April 2021 and January 2022: nine primary small intestinal, /uniFB01 ve pulmonary, two thymic, two unknown primary, one cecal, one presacral. Median age of the patient population at the time of enrollment was 63 years (range: 33-81 years): 12 males and 8 females. All patients had an ECOG performance status of 0-1 at enrollment and had received a median of three prior lines of systemic therapy. Nine patients received concurrent somatostatin analog during the trial. Table 1 summarizes the demographic characteristics of the study population.

## Duration of therapy

All patients were evaluable for toxicity analysis and received at least one cycle of therapy. Patients received an average of 11 cycles each of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib. Reasons for discontinuation of therapy included radiographic disease progression (10 patients), clinical progression (3 patients), toxicity (3 patients), death on study (2 patients), and other complicating disease, unrelated to primary disease or drug (1 patient). One patient remains on study. Toxicities leading to treatment discontinuation included grade 2 fatigue and grade 3 hypertension (1 patient) and grade 3 AST elevation and grade 2 rash (1 patient), and grade 3 brittle, insulindependent diabetes (1 patient). Table 2 represents all AEs possibly, probably, or de /uniFB01 nitely related to study drug and occurring in 2 or more patients. All data are available upon request.

## Radiographic response

Eighteen patients were assessable for radiographic response. Two patients discontinued treatment on study before restaging (one after cycle 1 and the other after cycle 2) and were not re-evaluated with scans. There were two objective responders per RECIST 1.1 (ORR: 10%; 95% CI 0.03% to 0.30%), one patient with a grade 2 small bowel NET and one with an atypical lung NET. When best response to therapy was evaluated, 15 patients (75%) had stable disease (Figure 1). One patient progressed at the /uniFB01 rst restaging scan and subsequently came off trial treatment. Of the two patients who achieved partial response, one progressed 10 months and one died of a likely ventricular arrhythmia related to myocardial metastases 8 months after response.

As the study did not meet the interim analysis requirement for four objective responders in the /uniFB01 rst stage of enrollment, the study was closed to accrual after completion of stage 1 enrollment.

## Progression-free and overall survival

All patients were assessable for survival analysis. At the time of data cut-off on 8 August 2023, 9 patients died and 11 patients remain alive and on follow-up. Median duration of follow-up is 19 months. Median PFS was 8 months (95% CI 5.8-10.2 months) (Figure 2), and median OS was not reached.

## Safety analysis

Overall, the safety pro /uniFB01 le of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib was similar to that reported in other cancers. The most commonlyoccurring drug-related AEs included hypertension,

fatigue, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache (often associated with hypertension), hypothyroidism, and adrenal insuf /uniFB01 ciency. Table 2 outlines all treatment-related toxicities.

Seventeen of 20 patients required modi /uniFB01 cation of at least one drug dosage or schedule. Five patients required dose reduction of lenvatinib to 8 mg (lowest dose allowed on trial), three of whom still could not tolerate the dose reduction and needed to come off lenvatinib altogether; two of those patients continued on pembrolizumab monotherapy. Most common reasons for dose reduction included uncontrolled hypertension, signi /uniFB01 cant abdominal pain, fatigue, or palmarplantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome.

The chief toxicity attributed to lenvatinib was hypertension. Ten patients (50%) had grade 3 hypertension, often starting immediately after initiation of treatment. Six patients experienced hypothyroidism attributable to either pembrolizumab or lenvatinib and requiring administration of thyroid hormone. Other endocrine toxicities attributed to pembrolizumab included brittle insulin-dependent diabetes in one patient and adrenal insuf /uniFB01 ciency in one patient.

Of the three patients who died on study, one was a responder who likely developed ventricular arrhythmia related to myocardial metastases; her death was deemed unlikely related to study drug. The two other deaths were attributable to progressive disease.

## Correlative studies

If available, archival tissue was sent to QualTek for central PD-L1 testing and evaluation of TILs. Thirteen patients had archival tissue available. Three of the 13 patients had PD-L1positive staining [PD-L1 score of 3 and 2 (range 0-100)], none of whom responded to treatment. TILs were scored from 0 to 3, and nine patients had the presence of TILs on

## DISCUSSION

Our phase II trial of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib for GI/ thoracic NETs did not meet the interim radiographic response threshold required to proceed beyond stage 1 of the Simon two-stage design. Indeed, the observed response rate of 10% was mildly lower than that seen with lenvatinib monotherapy in a similar population of patients treated on the GETNE study (15%). No patient experienced a dramatic objective response of the sort that would indicate activation of T cells and immune cytotoxicity. Thus, we were unable to demonstrate that lenvatinib, when added to pembrolizumab, might reverse the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of well-differentiated NETs.

Toxicities were as expected for both pembrolizumab and lenvatinib, although we observed a higher rate of grade 3 hypertension than typically reported with lenvatinib alone or in combination with pembrolizumab. While pembrolizumabassociated AEs were rare, some were signi /uniFB01 cant, including rare endocrinopathies such as brittle insulin-dependent

Background: SANET-ep (NCT02588170) and SANET-p (NCT02589821) demonstrated the efficacy and safety of surufatinib versus placebo in patients with advanced extra-pancreatic and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs). Here, we present a pooled analysis of final overall survival (OS) from two randomised phase 3 studies. Methods: The  SANET  studies  were  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  double-blind,  phase  3  studies  in  China, comparing the efficacy and safety of oral 300-mg surufatinib (n = 265) versus placebo (n = 133) in patients with

unresectable/metastatic, well-differentiated NETs (grade 1/2). After progression of disease or study unblinding, patients receiving placebo crossed over/switched to open-label surufatinib. By pooling the data from the two studies, OS analysis was completed using Kaplan -Meier methodology and a Cox proportional hazards model in the  intention-to-treat population. Exploratory analyses were performed using different models to correct the confounding effect introduced by crossover. Long-term safety was assessed.

Results: At study termination, 69 % of the placebo group had crossed over/switched to surufatinib. Median OS was 50.1 versus 46.8 months for patients initially on surufatinib versus those initially on placebo (stratified hazard ratio  [HR] 0.935, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.684 -1.278;  p = 0.6727). After correcting  the  confounding effect introduced by crossover/switching, the HR ranged from 0.558 to 0.825. Commonly ( ≥ 10 %) reported treatment-related adverse events (grade 3/4) included hypertension and proteinuria.

Conclusion: OS of patients initially on surufatinib was not significantly longer versus patients initially on placebo, likely due to the high amount of crossover from placebo to surufatinib. No new safety signals were observed. Clinical trials registration: SANET-ep (NCT02588170) and SANET-p (NCT02589821)

## 1. Introduction

and safety data from the SANET-ep and SANET-p studies.

Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are rare malignancies often originating in the pulmonary or gastrointestinal tract [1]. While rare, the incidence of NETs has been steadily increasing across Asia, Europe, and North America [2,3]; between 2000 and 2017, the aged-standardised incidence increased 9.8 % per year in China (overall incidence: 1.14 per 100,000 in 2017) and 3.6 % per year in the USA (overall incidence: 6.26  per  100,000  in  2017)  [4].  Well-differentiated  NETs  are  graded based on mitotic rates and Ki-67 index, with a higher grade associated with  poorer  prognosis  [3,5].  NETs  are  further  characterised  as  functioning  or  non-functioning,  based  on  the  presence  of  hormonal  syndromes [1]. Non-specific and late presentation of symptoms in patients with  non-functioning  NETs  can  lead  to  delayed  diagnosis  and  more advanced tumour burden compared with those with functioning NETs [6]. As NETs are generally indolent tumours, patients with advanced NETs typically have relatively long survival times; median overall survival (OS) varies greatly depending on grade (grade 1: 16.2 years; grade 2: 8.3 years; grade 3: 33 months) and primary tumour site (rectum: 24.6 years; pancreas: 3.6 years) [3,7]. Overall 5-year survival rates in 2017 for patients with NETs were 36.2 % in China and 63.9 % in the USA [4].

In addition to surgical resection and chemotherapy (streptozotocin, temozolomide, or capecitabine), advances in the understanding of NET biology have led to the development of a number of systemic treatment options [8,9] including somatostatin analogues (SSAs; octreotide [10] or lanreotide) [11,12], tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib) [13], mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (everolimus) [14,15], and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT; Lu-177 dotatate) [16,17]. Current  treatment  guidelines  commonly  recommend  surgery  and/or SSAs as first-line treatment, with more targeted treatment options recommended following disease progression [8,18 -20].

Surufatinib is a novel, small-molecule inhibitor that simultaneously targets  tumour  angiogenesis  (via  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor receptor [VEGFR]-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1) and immune evasion (via macrophage colony stimulating factor-1  receptor)  [21].  Two  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled phase 3 studies, SANET-ep (NCT02588170) in extra-pancreatic NETs  (epNETs)  and  SANET-p  (NCT02589821)  in  pancreatic  NETs (pNETs), were conducted in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of surufatinib in patients with unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated (grade 1/2) NETs [22 -24]. The primary endpoint of investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer with surufatinib versus placebo (SANET-ep: 9.2 vs 3.8 months, p &lt; 0.0001; SANET-p 10.9 vs 3.7 months, p = 0.0011). Both studies were terminated early after meeting the predefined criteria at interim analysis and on recommendation from the independent data monitoring committee (iDMC) [22,23]. Across both studies, surufatinib was well tolerated;  the  most  common treatment-related adverse events  (TRAEs) of grade ≥ 3 were hypertension and proteinuria [22,23].

In order to assess the survival and long-term safety of surufatinib in a large prospectively treated and monitored population, we pooled the OS

## 2. Methods

## 2.1. Study design and participants

SANET-ep and SANET-p were two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,  phase  3  studies  assessing  the  efficacy  and  safety  of surufatinib versus placebo in patients with epNETs or pNETs across 24 and  21  hospitals,  respectively,  in  China  [22,23].  Patients  aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated NETs of pathological grade 1 or 2 (per the 2010 World Health Organisation [WHO] classification) [25] originating from any extra-pancreatic or  a  pancreatic  location,  an  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, with a life expectancy of &gt; 12 weeks were eligible. Diagnoses and gradings were verified by a central laboratory before patient randomisation.

The key study exclusion criteria were high-grade (grade 3) neuroendocrine  tumour  and  neuroendocrine  carcinoma,  functioning  NETs that required treatment with a long-acting SSA, progression on prior treatment with a VEGF or VEGFR inhibitor, brain metastases (unstable or  uncontrolled),  other  malignancies,  or  clinically  significant  comorbidities. Detailed inclusion/exclusion criteria and methodology for the SANET-p and SANET-ep studies have been described previously [22,23].

## 2.2. Procedures

Patients  were  randomised  2:1  to  receive  oral  surufatinib  300 mg once daily (QD) or matched placebo in 4-week cycles until progression of  disease  (PD),  intolerable  toxicity,  withdrawal  of  consent,  poor compliance,  use  of  other  antitumour  medication,  pregnancy,  loss  to follow-up, or if the investigator deemed discontinuation was in the patient ' s  best  interest.  During  the  double-blind  phase,  crossover  from placebo  to  open-label  surufatinib  was  allowed  upon  PD,  defined  according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, version 1.1 [26].  Data from the double-blind phase of each study were used for assessment of the primary efficacy endpoint of PFS [22,23]. Both studies were terminated early after the pre-planned interim analysis based on iDMC recommendations for superior efficacy [22,23]. Study sites were unblinded on 4 July 2019 for the SANET-ep study and February 7, 2020 for SANET-p, respectively. After study site unblinding, all ongoing patients  were  unblinded  and  enroled  in  the  open-label  phase:  patients randomised to placebo during the double-blind period had the option to switch  (at the discretion of the investigator)  to  treatment  with open-label surufatinib (300 mg, QD) and patients randomised to surufatinib  could  remain  on  open-label  surufatinib  treatment.  Patients continued  open-label  surufatinib  treatment  until  PD  or  intolerable toxicity.

Patients  who  discontinued  the  study  drug  were  followed  up  for survival information on a 12-week basis (with a 2-week window) until the study closure. During the open-label phase, only safety assessments,

treatment duration, post-study antitumour therapy and survival followup information were collected. Adverse events (AEs) were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. All AEs recorded until the completion of the studies were evaluated and coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 25.0. Per protocol, the open-label phase of the  two  studies  would  continue  until  surufatinib  is  marketed  or  the sponsor terminates the entire study. The sponsor decided to stop the collection of all survival data on 7 July 2022. As a result, all patients who were  still  on  treatment  of  surufatinib  were  taken  off  the  study  and transitioned to post-trial access after that date.

confounders. The only important difference between the patients who crossed over/switched and those who did not is change in treatment [32]. The time of crossover/switch was included in the Cox proportional hazards model as a time-dependent covariable. Details can be found in the Supplementary Statistical Analysis Plan.

The  study  was  conducted  according  to  Good  Clinical  Practice guidelines and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The ethics  committee  at  each  study  site  approved  the  protocol  and  all amendments (available in the Supplement). All patients provided written informed consent before random assignment.

## 2.3. Statistical analysis

The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients randomised from the SANET-p or SANET-ep studies. Following the ITT principle, patients were analysed according to the treatment and stratum they were assigned to at randomisation. Primary analyses of baseline characteristics and OS were assessed using the ITT population. OS was defined  from  the  date  of  randomisation  to  the  date  of  death  by  any cause. Patients known to be alive at the end of the studies were censored at the last known alive date or cut-off date. OS was compared between the surufatinib and placebo groups in the ITT population using a stratified log-rank test, and treatment effect was estimated using a hazard ratio (HR) with a two-sided 95 % confidence interval (CI), derived by a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. The median survival times and 95 % CIs for the two arms were estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. The stratification factors (based on the stratification for SANETep/SANET-p randomisation) were NET pathological grade (Grade 1/2), prior  systemic  antitumour  treatments  (yes/no),  primary  lesion  of tumour A (jejunum, ileum, duodenum, thymus gland, caecum), B (lung, stomach, liver, appendix, colon, rectum), C (other origin or unknown origin), or D (pancreas) and ECOG performance status (0/1). The subgroup  analyses  assessed  the  potential  of  baseline  characteristics  as prognostic factors for OS.

The exploratory analysis for OS  was  performed  using  rankpreserving structural failure time (RPSFT) [27,28], a modified two-stage model (M2SM) [29,30], a time-dependent covariate model [31], and censored crossover/switch patients from placebo at crossover to  provide  the  treatment  effect  estimate  that  was  corrected  for  the confounding  effect  introduced  by  crossover/switch.  For  the  RPSFTM model, the key assumption is that experimental treatment effect is the same  regardless  of  when  it  is  given  (at  randomisation  or  at  crossover/switch  and  counterfactual  survival  time  is  balanced  between treatment groups due to randomisation) [32]. The survival of patients in control group was reconstructed, and re-censored, as if they had never crossed over/switched via an acceleration factor. The acceleration factor was estimated by using G-estimation. For the two-stage model, it was assumed  that  treatment  crossover/switching  only  occurred  after  a disease-related secondary baseline, such as disease progression. Then (assuming crossover/switching is only from the control group to the experimental  treatment),  post-secondary  baseline  survival  times  in control group patients who crossed over/switched to the experimental treatment were compared with those in the control group who did not switch, using a parametric accelerated failure time model (e.g., Weibull or Generalised Gamma), controlling for prognostic covariates measured at the secondary baseline time-point and including the switch indicator as a time-dependent variable which equals '1 ' after the time of crossover/switch  [33].  For  the  time-dependent  covariate  model,  the  key assumption  is  that  crossover/switch  is  not  influenced  by  any  prior treatments  or  covariates  that  also  influence  survival,  that  is,  no

The  safety  analyses  included  all  TRAEs  that  started/worsened  in severity on/after the first dose of surufatinib (double-blind or open-label phases) and those no later than the thirtieth day from the last dose of surufatinib that were considered as related, probably related, possibly related, or unlikely related to the study drug by the investigators, or with missing causality. Safety analyses were based on the safety set (defined as all patients who were randomised and received at least one dose of surufatinib). Statistical analyses were completed using SAS Enterprise Guide 8.3.

## 3. Results

## 3.1. Patient disposition

Between 9 December 2015 and 20 November 2019, 582 patients were screened across SANET-p and SANET-ep; 398 patients were randomised (surufatinib: n = 265; placebo n = 133) and 396 received at least one  dose  of  surufatinib  (n = 263)  or  placebo  (n = 133)  during  the double-blind phase. At study termination (7 July 2022, for both studies), 181 patients had received open-label surufatinib, including 92 patients who crossed over (n = 65) or switched (n = 27) from the placebo group and 89 patients who were randomly assigned to the surufatinib group during  the  double-blind  period  (Fig  1).  The  primary  reasons  for discontinuation  of  open-label  surufatinib  were  PD  (n = 96)  and  AEs (n = 28).

## 3.2. Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics

Baseline  demographics  and  clinical  characteristics  were  generally well balanced between groups in respect of age, sex, ECOG performance status, pathologic grade, and other characteristics (Table 1). The primary site of the tumour was gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) for 70 % of patients (in both groups). Most patients (85 %) had a pathologic grade of 2 at baseline. Previous systemic antitumour therapy for advanced disease had been received by 68 % and 64 % of patients in the initial surufatinib and the initial placebo groups, respectively (systemic chemotherapy -surufatinib: 40 %, placebo: 37 %; SSA -surufatinib: 37 %, placebo: 35 %; everolimus -surufatinib: 8 %, placebo: 9 %).

## 3.3. Treatment duration and follow-up

Among patients who received at least one dose of study treatment (initial  surufatinib:  n = 263,  initial  placebo:  n = 133),  the  median (range) duration of treatment exposure in the double-blind phase was 7.4 (0 -41) months in the surufatinib group versus 4.6 (0 -40) months in the placebo group. Among the 92 patients who crossed over/switched from placebo, the median (range) duration of exposure to open-label surufatinib  was  10.5  (0 -58)  months.  More  than  half  of  the  patients (55 %, 51/92) crossed over/switched from placebo to surufatinib within 6 months post randomisation.

Of the 355 patients treated with at least one dose of surufatinib, the median  (range)  duration  of  exposure  to  any  dose  was  10.1  (0 -71) months.  The  proportions  of  patients  receiving  surufatinib  for ≥ 12, ≥ 18, and ≥ 24 months were 43 %, 28 %, and 19 %, respectively.

## 3.4. Overall survival

The median duration of follow-up for OS was 49.1 months (95 % CI 45.7 -52.2) in the initial surufatinib group versus 48.0 months (95 % CI 44.6 -54.9) in the initial placebo group. By the cut-off date for the final survival analysis, 192 (48 %) patients had died; 127 (48 %) patients

initially  randomised to the surufatinib group and 65 (49 %) patients initially randomised to the placebo group. Most deaths occurred during the survival follow-up period (118 [45 %] and 56 [42 %] patients in the initial surufatinib and initial placebo groups, respectively). Overall, 206 patients were censored (including 153 patients alive, 29 patients lost to follow-up, and 24 patients withdrawn of consent) from the OS analysis; 138 from the initial surufatinib group and 68 from the initial placebo group.  Subsequent  anti-tumour  therapy  was  received  by  52 %  (138/ 265) of patients in the surufatinib group and 78 % (104/133) of patients in the placebo group, including 92 patients (69 %) who crossed over/ switched  to  open-label  surufatinib.  The  most  common  post-study treatments  (surufatinib  vs  placebo)  were  chemotherapy  (26 %  vs  20 %), SSA (25 % vs 17 %), everolimus (16 % vs 12 %), and VEGFR inhibitor (12 % vs 6 %) (Supplementary Table S1).

placebo  group.  A  consistent  trend  of  improvement  in  OS  following treatment with surufatinib compared with placebo was observed with HRs of 0.825 (95 % CI 0.602 -1.131) and 0.558 (95 % CI 0.405 -0.770), separately (Fig 2B -C), after correction for the confounding from crossover/switch. An improvement in median OS was also observed when separating patients initially randomised to placebo who switched to the open-label surufatinib group after unblinding and those who were not treated with open-label surufatinib, as well as those who crossed over to the open-label surufatinib group following PD (initial surufatinib group + placebo  switch  vs  placebo  group + placebo-surufatinib  crossover group: 52.6 vs 38.6  months;  HR  0.721;  95 %  CI  0.520 -1.000; p = 0.0488; Fig 2D). When using the time-dependent covariate model, the HR was 0.768 (95 % CI 0.477 -1.238; Supplementary Table S2).

The median OS was 50.1 months (95 % CI 40.1 -61.3) in the initial surufatinib group and 46.8 months (95 % CI 34.8 -60.7) in the initial placebo  group  (absolute  difference  3.3  months;  HR  0.935,  95 %  CI 0.684 -1.278; p = 0.6727 [Fig 2A]). The OS rates (initial surufatinib vs initial placebo) at 24 and 36 months were 74 % versus 71 % and 61 % versus 58 %, respectively.

More than two-thirds of patients initially randomised to the placebo group received  open-label  surufatinib  (92  of  133  [69 %]);  therefore, commonly used statistical modelling like the RPSFT and M2SM model were performed to correct for the confounding effects of crossover in the

The median OS in patients who received any dose of surufatinib (n = 355) versus patients without surufatinib (n = 41) was 50.5 months (95 % CI 41.5 -60.7) versus 22.8 months (95 % CI 17.1 -36.9) with a stratified HR of 0.466 (95 % CI 0.287 -0.756; nominal p = 0.0016 [Fig 2E]).

## 3.5. Baseline characteristics as prognostic factors for OS

In subgroup analyses among the ITT population (n = 398), patients with chromogranin A (CgA) ≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) had significantly longer OS versus patients with levels &gt; 2 times the ULN

Lower Ki-67 levels at baseline were also  associated  with  increased  OS  rates  (median  OS:  53.9  months  in patients with Ki-67 level at ≥ 3 % and ≤ 10 % vs 35.0 months in patients with Ki-67 levels at &gt; 10 %; unstratified HR 0.633, 95 % CI 0.457 -0.878; p = 0.0068; Fig 3). Patients with GEP as the primary tumour site had longer OS than those with non-GEP tumours (median OS: 54.1 months vs 38.7 months; unstratified HR 0.684, 95 % CI 0.509 -0.918; p = 0.0110 [Fig 3]). Patients with fewer organs affected by the tumour also had longer OS than those with more affected sites (median OS ≤ 2 vs ≥ 3: 61.3 vs 38.7 months; HR 0.580; 95 % CI 0.431 -0.779; Fig 3). In terms of prior systemic antitumour treatment for advanced disease, the median OS was 36.2 month in patients treated with prior chemotherapy versus 60.7 months without, 52.6 months in patients treated with prior SSA versus 40.4 months without, and 39.9 months in patients treated with prior everolimus or a VEGFR inhibitor versus 50.2 months without.

## 3.6. Long-term safety

The  safety  findings  were  consistent  with  the  previously  reported safety profile of surufatinib, with no new safety findings identified. AE profiles from the double-blind phase of the studies were reported previously [22,23]. Over the course of both studies, most patients with any dose  of  surufatinib  (n = 355 ) experienced  TRAEs  (98 %).  The  most commonly  reported  TRAEs  ( ≥ 30 %)  were  proteinuria,  hypertension, diarrhoea, blood thyroid stimulating hormone increased, blood bilirubin increased, aspartate aminotransferase increased, occult blood positive, and  hypertriglyceridaemia.  Commonly  reported  TRAEs  ( ≥ 10 %)  of grade 3/4 were hypertension and proteinuria (Table 2). In total, 105 (30 %) patients reported serious TRAEs, the most commonly reported events ( ≥ 1 %) were abdominal pain, proteinuria, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, intestinal obstruction, jaundice cholestatic, diarrhoea, anaemia, cerebral haemorrhage, and hypertension. The TRAEs leading to surufatinib discontinuation were reported in 65 (18 %) patients, and the  most  commonly  reported  events  ( ≥ 1 %)  included  protein  urine present, proteinuria, and diarrhoea. Fatal TRAEs were reported in nine (3 %) patients, seven of which occurred during the double-blind phase and were reported previously [22,23]. During the open-label phase, one patient died 4 days after the last dose of surufatinib due to cerebral haemorrhage, which was considered as possibly related to surufatinib by the investigator. The other patient died of unknown causes 14 days after the last dose of surufatinib, which was considered as unlikely related to surufatinib by the investigator; other causality was the primary disease.

## 4. Discussion

Over  the  past  decade,  treatment  patterns  in  locally  advanced  or metastatic,  well-differentiated  NETs  have  achieved  substantial  advancements on a global scale. However, most research, especially for the pivotal studies supporting approval of the therapies for NETs, are based on Western patient populations, limiting understanding of the efficacy of these therapies in Asian or Chinese populations. Key population differences include the primary site of NETs, with the colon, lung, rectum, and small intestine having highest incidence in the US and the pancreas and stomach having the highest incidence in China, and sex differences, with females having a higher incidence in the US and males a higher incidence in China [4]. The SANET-ep and SANET-p studies addresses an unmet medical need in the treatment of NETs in China [22,23].

In terms of OS data on targeted monotherapy in patients with NETs, the reports so far have also been limited to the Western patient population (treatment vs placebo): 38.6 versus 29.1 months with sunitinib in patients with pNETs, 44.0 versus 37.7 months with everolimus in patients with pNETs, 40.0 versus 31.1 months with cabozantinib in patients with pNETs, and 21.9 versus 19.7 months with cabozantinib in patients  with  epNETs,  respectively  [13,34].  In  addition  to  the  aforementioned therapeutic agents, alternative VEGFR-TKIs, including lenvatinib and axitinib, have likewise demonstrated OS outcomes in early stages  of  clinical  studies  [35,36].  To  our  knowledge,  SANET-ep  and SANET-p are the two largest sample-size, pivotal studies conducted in the Asian population with NETs to date. These studies were conducted concurrently and had the same trial design, the same treatment regimen, and  similar  demographic  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the enroled patients, the only difference was the origin of NET. Therefore, we pooled the results from both studies to assess OS and long-term safety of  surufatinib  in  patients  with  advanced  NETs  regardless  of  tumour origin in a larger population, though the studies were not powered for the assessment of OS. In the pooled results, most patients (85 %) had tumours of WHO pathological grade 2, and over half (56 %) had tumour involvement in ≥ 3 organs, highlighting the high disease burden of this patient population at baseline. A total of 67 % of patients had received

prior  systemic  antitumour  therapy,  which  mainly  included  systemic chemotherapy (39 %) and SSA (36 %). In this population, no significant OS benefit was observed with surufatinib versus placebo, likely due to the  crossover/switch  design  and  the  studies  not  being  adequately powered for assessment of OS. In total, 69 % of patients from the placebo group crossed over/switched to surufatinib treatment (crossover: 71 %, switch: 29 %); over half of the patients (55 %) who crossed over did so ≤ 6 months from randomisation. The median duration of placebo exposure was only 4.6 months in the double-blind phase; thus, exposure to placebo in these studies was short, and it is considered that surufatinib largely contributed to the OS observed in the placebo group. The OS outcomes from the SANET studies were consistent with findings of other phase 3 studies evaluating everolimus, sunitinib, Lu-177 dotatate, and cabozantinib that reported OS where patients with NETs have crossed over from placebo to the active treatment arm [13,14,34,37]. Although OS is a desirable endpoint in many cancers, it has proven to be very challenging in studies of NETs. Additionally, while the results from the sensitivity analyses by different statistical modelling showed potential OS benefits of surufatinib  by correcting the confounding from crossover/switch, the methods rely on different assumptions that are difficult to verify, and the number of patients who never received surufatinib was quite  limited  and  may  include  patients  with  more  severe  disease, meaning these results should be interpreted with caution.

It is worth noting that, as one of the most promising treatment approaches, PRRT with Lu-177 dotatate was approved by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with unresectable, low- or intermediate-grade, locally advanced  or  metastatic  gastroenteropancreatic  NETs  [38].  A  large retrospective  study  demonstrated  a  median  OS  of  ~12  years  in  508 patients  with  advanced  gastroenteropancreatic  NETs  who  received PRRT or chemotherapy or targeted therapy as second-line treatment after PD with SSA treatment. Though not directly comparable due to different  data  sources from a prospective randomised-controlled trial versus a retrospective study, we consider the stark disparity in survival outcomes is possibly attributed to divergent patterns of clinical practice between China and international settings. In the SANET studies, none of the  enroled  patients  had  received  PRRT  prior  to  study  participation. Only one patient received PRRT as subsequent therapy upon discontinuation from the SANET studies, owing to the lack of approval in China and the absence of large-scale clinical studies of PRRT until 2022.

In addition, similar to PRRT, the low percentage of patients receiving treatment  regimens  other  than  chemotherapy,  both  prior  to  and following surufatinib treatment (SSAs: prior 36 % and subsequent 22 %; everolimus: prior 9 % and subsequent 15 %; Table 1 and Supplementary Table  S1),  may  partly  reflect  the  current  status  of  limited  treatment options for patients with NETs in China between 2015 and 2022. This is

attributed to multiple factors, including economic consideration, medical insurance coverage limitations, regulatory approval status within China, and the paucity of clinical studies involving these agents.

In  all  patients  randomised  in  both  studies  (n = 398),  we  also explored  the  effects  of  different  prognostic  factors  on  OS.  Subgroup analyses  revealed  that  higher  baseline  levels  of  CgA  or  Ki-67  were indicative of poor prognosis in patients with advanced NETs, supporting the results of prior research on the use of CgA and Ki-67 as prognostic markers [39,40]. A non-GEP primary tumour site was also associated with  shorter  survival  which,  with  the  exception  of  pNETs,  is  also consistent with previous reports in published literature [3,4]. A prolonged median OS (52.6 months) was observed in patients who had previously received SSA compared with chemotherapy (36.2 months) or everolimus/VEGFR  inhibitors  (39.9  months),  suggesting  a  potential benefit for the sequential therapy of surufatinib following SSA. However, we cannot conclude whether there is a potential benefit for the sequential therapy of surufatinib following SSA, because the number of patients  who  had  previously  been  treated  with  everolimus  or  other globally approved products was limited (as mentioned above). Patients who had not received prior chemotherapy had prolonged OS compared with  those  who  had  received  chemotherapy  (60.7  vs  36.2  months), highlighting the detrimental effects of this therapy or potential bias in this patient population to those with more high-grade disease/rapidly progressing disease. Additionally, univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that the number of prior treatment lines (0, 1, ≥ 2) did not have a significant impact on OS, which is consistent with the findings from the large retrospective SEPTRALU study in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms [41].

Safety findings were consistent with the previously reported safety profile of surufatinib, with no new findings identified during the longterm follow up in this large patient population, indicating a manageable safety profile [22,23]. TRAEs of grade ≥ 3 occurred in 74 % of patients, with the most common being hypertension and proteinuria, consistent  with  the  established  profile  for  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors [42]. The TRAEs leading to drug discontinuation in the double-blind phase  occurred  in  18  %  of  patients  for  SANET-ep  and  11  %  for SANET-p [22,23]. After the long-term follow-up in this study, the rate was 18 %, indicating that long-term use of surufatinib did not increase the incidence of TRAEs leading to discontinuation.

A limitation of these studies was that they only contained a Chinese study  population.  Early-phase  studies  have  been  conducted  in  US (NCT02549937)  and  European  (NCT04579679)  patients  with  NETs; results from the US population were broadly consistent with results from the  Chinese  population  studies  [43].  Secondly,  due  to  the  limited

accessibility of sunitinib, everolimus, PRRT, or other regimens during the  initiation  of  the  SANET  studies  in  2015,  a  minority  (33 %)  of treatment-naïve patients were enroled, although OS analysis was stratified according to previous treatment. In addition, other than CgA and Ki-67, data on additional biomarkers were not collected and analysed, limiting  the  interpretation  of  prognostic  factors  for  the  efficacy  of surufatinib.

In summary, at final analysis of the SANET-ep and SANET-p studies, no statistically significant improvement in OS was observed comparing surufatinib with placebo, likely due to the high proportion of patients who  crossed  over/switched  from  placebo  to  surufatinib  during  the study.  The  effect  of  prognostic  factors  on  survival  in  patients  with advanced NETs was generally consistent with the findings of previous studies,  and  no  new  safety  signals  were  observed  in  the  long-term follow-up of surufatinib.

## Abstract

Background: In  advanced  neuroendocrine  tumors  (NET),  antiproliferative  treatment  options  beyond  somatostatin  analogs  remain  limited. Temozolomide (TMZ) has shown efficacy in NET alone or combined with other drugs.

Materials and Methods: SONNET (NCT02231762) was an open, multicenter, prospective, phase II study to evaluate lanreotide autogel 120 mg (LAN) plus  TMZ in patients with progressive advanced/metastatic grade 1/2 gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NET or of unknown primary. Patients could be enrolled at first-line or higher therapy line. The primary endpoint was disease control rate ([DCR], rate of stable disease [SD], partial [PR], and complete response [CR]) at 6 months of LAN and  TMZ. Patients with nonfunctioning (NF) NET without progression at 6 months were randomized to 6-month LAN maintenance or watch and wait, patients with functioning (F)-NET with clinical benefit (PR, SD) continued on LAN.

Results: Fifty-seven patients were recruited. The majority of patients received the study drug at second or higher treatment line and had an NET G2. DCR at 6 months LAN and  TMZ was 73.5%. After 6 months of further LAN maintenance, 54.5% of patients with F-NET and 71.4% with NF-NET had SD or PR vs 41.7% with NF-NET on observation only. LAN and  TMZ were effective in all subgroups analyzed. At 12 months of follow-up, median progression-free survival was 11 .1 months. Median serum chromogranin A decreased except in NF-NET on observation. O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation appeared to better reflect TMZ response than loss of gene expression. During combination therapy, the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events grade 3/4 reported were nausea (14%), thrombocytopenia (12.3%), and neutropenia (8.8%). Four deaths were reported resulting from severe adverse events not considered related to study medication.

Conclusions: LAN plus TMZ is a treatment option for patients with progressive GEP-NET with more aggressive biological profile showing a manageable safety profile.

## Implications for Practice

Neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas are neoplasms that originate from cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine cell system. Drugs that control tumor growth and/or inhibit hormone release are a mainstay of management of neuroendocrine tumors. This study investigated the combined treatment with lanreotide, a drug derived from the naturally occurring inhibitory hormone somatostatin, and the chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide. The results show that lanreotide plus temozolomide provided clinical benefit in patients who have failed on other therapies or for whom other therapies are unsuitable. The combined treatment with addition of lanreotide to temozolomide does not seem to result in more adverse events than treatment with temozolomide alone. Less than 10% of the patients discontinued the trial due to side effects related to the study drug.

## Background

Neuroendocrine  tumors  (NET)  are  a  heterogeneous  group of rare malignancies most often localized in the gastrointestinal  tract,  lung,  and  pancreas.  Reported  incidence  is  up  to 7/100  000. 1,2   Prognosis  depends  on  primary  site,  presence of metastatic disease, tumor grade and stage at diagnosis as well  as  hormonal  secretion.  At  presentation,  most  patients have unresectable disease due to local extension or metastases. 1   Strategies  of  gastroenteropancreatic  (GEP)  NET  treatment include tumor removal, control of tumor growth and symptoms as well as maintenance of quality of life (QoL). 3 Metastasized well-differentiated low-grade NET are usually controlled  by  antisecretory  and  antiproliferative  treatments such as somatostatin analogs or targeted therapies, as well as by local treatments and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT). 4

For somatostatin analogs, 2 placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated antiproliferative activity. The PROMID study showed improvement in time to progression in therapy-naïve midgut  NET  by  octreotide  long-acting release. 5 In the CLARINET study, 6  lanreotide autogel (LAN) resulted in prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) vs placebo in patients with  metastatic  grade  1  or  2  (Ki-67  ≤10%)  somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive enteropancreatic nonfunctioning (NF)-NET with prior stable disease (SD). Tumor stabilization and  PFS  &gt;12  months  after  LAN  120  mg  was  also  demonstrated in a Spanish open-label phase II study in patients with progressive NET. 7

In Europe, LAN 120 mg/4 weeks is currently licensed for the treatment of grade 1 and a subset of grade 2 (Ki-67 index ≤10%) GEP-NET of midgut, pancreatic, or unknown origin where hindgut sites of origin have been excluded, in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease. In addition, it is indicated for the treatment of symptoms associated with NET (particularly carcinoid tumors). 8  In the US, it is approved for the treatment of patients with unresectable, well- or moderately differentiated, locally advanced, or metastatic  GEP-NET to improve PFS, and, in addition, for the treatment of patients with carcinoid syndrome. 9

In  advanced  NET,  however,  antiproliferative  treatment options beyond somatostatin analogs remain limited. According  to  current  guidelines, 4,10   PRRT  is  a  therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-positive NET with homogenous SSTR  expression.  PRRT  may  be  recommended  in  midgut NET as a second-line  therapy  after  failure  of  somatostatin analogs in patients fulfilling the minimal general requirements for PRRT 11  and may be considered as well at further therapy lines  and  in  NET  from  other  sites  than  midgut. 4,10 The  use of systemic chemotherapy is usually restricted to poorly differentiated  neuroendocrine carcinoma, or NET with higher proliferative activity, particularly if of pancreatic or pulmonary  origin.  Streptozotocin-based  chemotherapy  is  one  of the treatment options approved in pancreatic NET but is not widely available in all countries. 12  The alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) is an alternative option, and showed promising efficacy in a retrospective study in pancreatic NET and in a limited number of small studies in mixed patient populations, both as monotherapy 13  or in combination with bevacizumab, 14  thalidomide, 15 everolimus, 16 or capecitabine. 17-20 A  prospective  phase  II  study  in  pancreatic  NET  recently showed  similar  overall  response  rates  (ORR)  for  TMZ  vs capecitabine  and TMZ;  however,  the  combination  regimen was  associated  with  more  durable  PFS-but  also  included more NET G1 with a more favorable prognosis. 21  While some studies found superior response to TMZ in association with promoter methylation or loss of gene expression of the DNA repair  enzyme  O6-methylguanine  DNA  methyltransferase (MGMT), 22,23  other studies failed to show this relationship. Altogether,  contradictory  results  exist  concerning  MGMT status as a predictive molecular marker in patients with NET treated with alkylating agents, and data from a prospective evaluation are missing so far. 24,25

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined LAN and TMZ as an alternative treatment option in patients with progressive advanced/metastatic grade 1 or 2 GEP-NET or NET (ie, cancer) of unknown primary origin (NET-CUP).

## Materials and Methods

## Patients

Patients ≥18 years of age diagnosed with advanced unresectable or metastatic differentiated GEP-NET grade 1 or 2 (Ki-67 index ≤20%) or NET-CUP confirmed by pathological/histological  assessment  and  progressive  disease  (PD) within 12 months before inclusion according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 26 by  computed  tomography  (CT)  or  magnetic  resonance imaging (MRI) and a World Health Organization (WHO) performance score 0-2 could be included. Resectability of the tumor lesions was assessed in interdisciplinary tumor boards of participating centers based on distribution and exact localization of liver lesions following current guidelines recommendations. 4,10  Patients had to have a positive SSTR status as assessed by SSTR scintigraphy (including single photon emission tomography (SPECT or SPECT/CT) or SSTR positron emission tomography (PET)/CT) within 12 months before screening as confirmed by an independent  central  read.  Absolute  neutrophil  count  had  to  be ≥1.5 × 10 9 /L  prior  to  TMZ  administration  (thrombocyte count, ≥100 × 10 9 /L). Main exclusion criteria were insulinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia, glycated hemoglobin &gt;8.5%, therapy with sunitinib, everolimus, or interferonα within 4 weeks prior to screening, TMZ at any time; PRRT (≤3 months before inclusion), local ablative therapies (≤6 months),  irradiation  of  target  lesions  (≤12  months),  and major surgery (≤3 months).

## Study Design

SONNET was an open-label, prospective, multicenter, noncomparative  phase  II  study  (EudraCT:  2013-001697-17; Clinical  Trials.gov:  NCT02231762).  All  patients  received treatment with LAN 120 mg/4 weeks with TMZ for the first 6 months (Figure 1; combination treatment phase). TMZ was administered for 5 consecutive days every 28 days at 150 mg/ m 2 /day for 1 month, then increased to 200 mg/m 2 /day depending on the safety laboratory values. In case of clinical benefit of combination treatment, defined as either tumor remission or  SD  according  to  RECIST  1.1,  patients  with  functioning (F)-NET received LAN 120 mg/4 weeks for another 6 months as maintenance treatment; patients with NF-NET and clinical benefit after 6 months were randomized to LAN 120 mg/4 weeks or no treatment following a watch-and-wait concept (Fig. 1; maintenance treatment phase).

The  primary  endpoint  was  disease  control  rate  (DCR) after  6  months  of  combination  treatment.  DCR  was  imaging based and defined as a combination of the RECIST 1.1 categories 'complete response' (CR), 'partial response' (PR), or  'stable  disease'  (=nonPD).  Main  secondary  endpoints were DCR after 12 months (LAN 120 mg maintenance or watch  and  wait),  time  to  progression  or  death  occurring within  12  months  after  first  combination  treatment  (statistical estimation of PFS), biochemical response after 6 and 12 months based  on  increase  or  decrease  of  serum  chromogranin A (CgA) levels (SD defined as &lt;50% decrease or ≤25% increase from baseline; PD: ≥25% increase as best response; PR: decrease of ≥50%) and urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels only in patients with F-NET (carcinoid syndrome)  (response  defined  as  5-HIAA  reduction  compared to baseline, progression defined as 5-HIAA increase). DCRs were analyzed according to the following variables at baseline and categories: functional status (F-NET vs NF-NET), NET location  (pancreatic,  small  intestinal,  other),  tumor  grade according to the WHO 2010 classification (G1, proliferation index  Ki-67  &lt;3%  and  G2,  Ki-67  3%-20%), 27   and  hepatic tumor  load  (≤25%,  &gt;25%).  Additionally,  DCR  according to Ki-67 categories (&lt;5%, 5%-10%, and &gt;10%-20%) were studied. Analysis of further Ki-67 categories was based on the evidence of improved prognostic stratification from previous publications. 28-31

Other endpoints included symptomatic response in patients with F-NET, changes of QoL questionnaire scores as well as MGMT expression and methylation, and SSTR expression in correlation with DCR.

For standardization of the imaging-based endpoints throughout the study population, CT/MRI examination protocols were harmonized with a prescribed minimal standard via the study protocol regarding imaging technique including  multiphasic  contrast-enhanced  CT/MRI  according  to the  European  Neuroendocrine Tumor Society  guidelines. 32 As per study protocol, CT or MRI examinations were performed at baseline and every 12 weeks until the end of the study. The  study  was  conducted  in  compliance  with  independent ethics  committees/institutional  review  boards,  the Declaration  of  Helsinki  (Version  2013),  and  International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  Guidelines.  All  patients  provided  written  informed consent.

## Assessments

For  determination  of  the  imaging-based  endpoints,  the  CT and MRI examinations were pseudonymized and forwarded to  a  central  server  and  underwent  an  independent  blinded read applying RECIST 1.1 by an experienced radiologist and nuclear medicine specialist (T.D., 15 years of experience with NET imaging).

Routine  laboratory  assessments,  serum  CgA,  and  urine 5-HIAA  determinations  were  performed  at  the  Spranger Laboratories,  Ingolstadt,  Germany.  CgA  was  measured  by an  enzyme-linked  immunosorbent  assay  (IBL  International, Hamburg, Germany).

QoL  was  assessed  by  the  German-validated  version  of the  European  Organization  for  Research  and Treatment  of Cancer  (EORTC)  Study  Group's  30-item  Quality  of  Life Questionnaire  (QLQ-C30)  (subscores:  global  health  status; physical,  role,  emotional,  cognitive,  and  social  functional scales; and symptom scales) and the 21-item EORTC QLQGINET21 questionnaire (subscores: treatment-related symptoms, weight gain, information/communication  function, sexual function, endocrine symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms,  social  function,  disease-related  worries,  muscle/bone pain symptoms, and body image).

## Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemical stainings were performed on a Benchmark XT  autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Tuscon, AZ, USA) with standard antigen retrieval methods and  according  to  standard  procedures.  With  regard  to  the immunohistochemical  staining  with  monoclonal  antibodies against  SSTR-2a  (clone  MMB1diluted  at  a  ratio  of  1:200; abcam)  and  5  (clone  MMB4  diluted  at  a  ratio  of  1:100; abcam), the proportion of membrane-bound positive tumor cells was evaluated using a scoring scheme (score 0: no expression, score 1: cytoplasmic expression, score 2: incomplete circumferential expression in less than 50% of tumor cells). 33

MGMT protein expression was performed using a monoclonal MGMT antibody (clone MT23.2, diluted at a ratio of 1:50; Invitrogen). MGMT showed strong nuclear reactivity in internal controls (lymphocytes and endothelial cells). Positive MGMT staining was defined as the staining intensity of the majority of tumor cells &gt;50% similar to that of the adjacent endothelial  cells.  Negative  MGMT  staining  was  defined  as

tumor cells with no or weak staining than that of endothelial cells. We used the same semiquantitative immunohistochemical procedure described elsewhere. 34

## MGMT Promoter Methylation Status in Tumor Samples

Areas of high tumor cell content (&gt;70%) were chosen and macrodissected for further analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from  paraffin-embedded  tumor  samples  using  the  Qiagen DNeasy blood  and  tissue  DNA  extraction  kit  according  to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After sodium bisulfite modification, quantitative methylation analyses were performed by pyrosequencing analysis described elsewhere. 35  The percentage of methylated alleles was calculated as the mean of the obtained methylation percentage. The cutoff value of &gt;10% was defined to classify MGMT-methylated vs  nonmethylated  cases,  which  is  commonly  used  and  validated for routine clinical diagnostics in gliomas. 36

## Safety Assessments

Safety  assessments  included  vital  signs,  biochemistry,  and hematology  laboratory  values.  Adverse  events  (AE)  were reported using the National  Cancer  Institute  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) classification (Version 4.0), coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 18.0, and classified by MedDRA preferred term and system organ class. The presence of gallbladder stones was assessed by ultrasound at baseline and at months 12 and 24 by the investigators.

## Statistical Analysis

The  single-arm  study  was  designed  to  demonstrate  that DCR after 6 months of combination treatment was greater than 45%, judged to be clinically meaningful. Assuming an expected proportion of subjects with a DCR after 6 months of combination treatment of 70% and 40 evaluable subjects, the study had a power of 88% to demonstrate that the proportion  of  subjects  with  DCR  after  6  months  was  greater than 45% with a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 (equivalent to a onesided alpha of 0.025) and using exact methods. All efficacy endpoints  were  analyzed  in  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  by  means  of  descriptive  statistical  methods  (mean, range [minimum, maximum], median, and interquartile range [IQR]);  the  primary  endpoint  was  described  along  with  its respective 95% CI. Kaplan-Meier estimate of PFS was constructed and median PFS was obtained along with 95% CI for all patients included in the study as well as for subgroups such as MGMT methylation and expression status. Symptomatic response was evaluated from absolute changes from baseline in the number of episodes for diarrhea and flushing per day using the mean of the last 3 days before the visit at each visit as compared to baseline. QoL subscores were described with changes from baseline in QLQ-C30 and GINET21 scores at each visit. Descriptive analyses of subgroups on F-/NF-NET, primary tumor localization, grade, and hepatic tumor burden were performed on specific efficacy tables. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Analysis System software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

## Results

## Patient Disposition

Fifty-seven of 64 screened patients with advanced NET started the combination phase and received combined treatment with

LAN 120 mg/4 weeks and TMZ. Screening failures included patients who did not meet entry criteria ( n = 5), consent withdrawal  ( n = 1),  and  an  adverse  event  ( n = 1)  that  occurred after informed consent and before first administration of the study medication. Thirty-seven patients completed the combination phase and had clinical benefit (Supplementary Fig. S1).  Of  these,  11  had  F-NET  and  received  LAN  120  mg/4 weeks  and  26  had  NF-NET  and  were  randomized  equally to receive either LAN 120 mg (14 patients) or no treatment (12 patients). Seventeen patients treated with LAN 120 mg (F-NET, n = 8;  NF-NET, n = 9)  and  7  nontreated  patients (watch and wait) completed the maintenance phase. During the combination phase, the proportion of patients who were assessed for the primary efficacy parameter (86.0%) and who discontinued  treatment  from  this  phase  (35.1%)  was  similar to the proportions in the maintenance phase (86.2% and 35.1%, respectively). During the combination phase treatment discontinuations ( n = 20) were mainly due to AE (9 [45.0%] patients)  and  disease  progression  (6  [30.0%]  patients);  discontinuations  during  the  maintenance  phase  ( n = 13)  were mainly due to disease progression (10 [76.9%] patients) and AE (3 [23.1%] patients) (Supplementary Fig. S1).

## Patient and  Tumor Characteristics

Median age of the enrolled patients was 65.0 years, most of them were male (Table 1). Median time from diagnosis was 24.5 months. Primary tumor location was mainly small intestinal (43.9%) followed by pancreatic (35.1%) and colorectal (7.0%),  about  one-third  were  functionally  active  (36.8%). The majority (84.2%) of patients presented with grade 2 disease, 86% with distant metastases. In more than half of the patients, hepatic tumor load exceeded 10% (Table 1).

Prior surgical procedures for GEP-NET were reported in 37  (64.9%)  patients  (Table  1).  Procedures  included  (multiple procedures in the same patient possible) partial pancreatectomy in 8 (14.0%) patients, hemicolectomy in 6 (10.5%) patients,  ileum  segment  resection/ileocecal  resection  in  6 (10.5%) patients, cancer surgery in 5 (8.8%) patients, lymphadenectomy in 5 (8.8%) patients, splenectomy in 5 (8.8%) patients, cholecystectomy in 4 (7.0%) patients, hepatectomy in  4  (7.0%)  patients,  ileal  operation  in  4  (7.0%)  patients, small  intestinal  resection  in  4  (7.0%)  patients,  explorative laparotomy in 2 (3.5%) patients, hepatic embolization in 2 (3.5%) patients, intestinal anastomosis in 2 (3.5%) patients, resection of rectum in 2 (3.5%) patients, tumor excision in 2  (3.5%)  patients,  and  appendectomy  in  1  (1.8%)  patient (Table  1).  Forty-seven  (82.5%)  patients  had  at  least  one prior  systemic  therapy  for  NET,  of  whom  34  (59.6%)  had somatostatin analogs (octreotide or lanreotide), 12 (21.1%) patients tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), 29 (50.9%) patients had prior PRRT (Table 1). Patients had received a mean of 1.6 (range, 0-4) prior treatment lines.

All  examined  tumor  samples  ( n = 38)  showed  a  strong incomplete (score  2;  36.8%)  or  complete  (score  3;  63.2%) membrane-bound  expression  of  the  SSTR-2a.  The  SSTR-5 receptor was not expressed in about two-thirds of the cases (score 0) and was incompletely expressed (score 2) in about one-third of the cases (Table 1).

## Disease Control and Progression

DCR after 6 months of combination treatment was chosen as primary endpoint since it well reflects the clinical benefit of the patients. In our study, 36 from 49 (73.5%) patients had

After further 6 months of maintenance therapy or observation, 6 (54.5%) LAN-treated patients with F-NET, 10 (71.4%) LAN-treated patients with NF-NET, and 5 (41.7%) patients with NF-NET on observation showed disease control (Fig. 2). Summarized DCR for all patients with F-NET and NF-NET treated with LAN during the maintenance treatment phase ( n = 25) was 64% (Fig. 2).

At the end of the combination phase, DCRs were numerically similar between patients with F-and NF-NET ( n = 12; 70.6%  and n = 24;  75.0%,  respectively;  Table  2).  Higher DCR was observed in the following subgroups: NF-NET, primary tumor in small intestinal or other locations,  grade  1, and Ki-67 &lt;5% (Supplementary Table S1).

primary tumor. At the end of the maintenance phase, PR was observed in 3 (21.4%) LAN-treated patients with NF-NET, all  of  them  with  pancreatic  primary  tumors.  Six  (16.2%) patients had PD and no patient had a CR in any treatment phase  during  the  study.  Overall  median  estimated  PFS  was 11.1 months (95% CI, 8.3-not calculated [NC]) across all

## MGMT Status and Tumor Response (DCR)

Tissue samples from 42 tumors were sent in for pathological examination with imaging data at 6 months for primary endpoint evaluation being available for 41 patients. Twenty-seven tissue samples were evaluable for MGMT promoter methylation. In 11 (40.7%) of these tumors, the MGMT promoter was methylated and in 16 (59.3%), it was not methylated. MGMT protein expression was evaluable in 33 tissue samples. MGMT was  expressed  in  12  (36.4%)  tumors,  whereas  21  (63.6%) tumor samples did not show nuclear MGMT reactivity. In order to study whether MGMT methylation correlates with a loss of MGMT protein expression, the cases were evaluated in which both MGMT methylation status and MGMT protein expression were present. Here, 63% of the cases with MGMT methylation concurrently showed a loss of MGMT protein expression, whereas in 37% this correlation was not demonstrated.

Analysis of DCR according to MGMT status was performed in patients of the ITT population, ie, for whom both, imaging results for evaluation of the primary endpoint of DCR at 6 months of treatment and sufficient tissue for molecular analysis were available ( n = 41; Table 2). Eight patients of the ITT population were not included in this analysis due to missing imaging data at 6 months of treatment and/or lack of evaluable tissue. Ten from 11 (90.9%) patients with methylated gene promoter had controlled disease (all SD) and 1 patient (9.1%) experienced disease progression (Table 2). From 15 patients lacking MGMT promoter methylation, 11 (73.3%) had controlled disease (60.0% SD, 6.7% PR) and 4 (26.7%) progressed.  From  11  patients  with  MGMT  expression,  10 (90.9%)  had  disease  control  (81.8%  SD,  9.1%  PR)  and  1 (9.1%) patient  experienced  disease  progression.  Expression was  lost  in  21  patients.  Fifteen  of  these  (71.4%)  had  controlled  disease  (66.7%  SD,  4.8%  PR)  and  6  (28.6%)  had disease progression (Table 2). No association was observed between MGMT status and PFS (not shown).

## Biochemical Response

At  baseline  overall  median  serum  CgA  levels  were  509.8 µg/L  (IQR  98.5-2445.2)  ( n = 48),  34  (69.4%)  patients  had CgA levels ≥100 μ g/L. Median CgA levels decreased to 200.6 µg/L (IQR 80.2-914.6) at the end of the combination phase ( n = 32)  and  to  156.9  µg/L  (IQR  73.3-374.3)  at  month  12 ( n = 37)  irrespective  of  the  type  of  maintenance  therapy. SD by CgA levels was observed in 9 patients and PR in 7 patients at the end of the combination phase. During combined treatment, serum CgA levels numerically increased in patients with F-NET from 203.7 µg/L (IQR 66.3-1978.9) to 310.3 µg/L (IQR 79.1-1189.0) at 6 months ( n = 9) and during LAN maintenance, numerically decreased to 101.6 µg/L (IQR 69.0-298.1) at month 12 ( n = 8). In patients with NF-NET, CgA levels decreased during combined treatment from 500.6 µg/L (98.5-2524.4) ( n = 14) to 257.5 µg/L (68.8-1343.7) at 6 months ( n = 12) in patients who then entered LAN maintenance and from 232.6 µg/L (IQR 101.1-927.4) ( n = 11) to 105.0 µg/L (IQR 81.3-453.3) at month 6 ( n = 10) in patients who had been randomized into the watch-and-wait group. At month 12, CgA levels further decreased in LAN-treated patients  to  170.8  µg/mL  (IQR  70.0-381.9)  ( n = 8) but returned to baseline levels in patients without LAN therapy (226.0  µg/mL  [IQR  87.8-374.3], n = 7).  Figure  3A  shows serum CgA levels according to the treatment groups of the maintenance phase.

In  patients  with  F-NET,  median  urine  5-HIAA  levels decreased from 350.4 µmol/24 h (IQR 140.5-848.1) at baseline  ( n = 12)  to  318.8  µmol/24  h  (IQR  113.5-1147.5)  in month  6  ( n = 10).  During  the  maintenance  phase,  median urine 5-HAA levels further decreased to 116.2 mg/24 h (IQR 42.9-297.1) in month 12 ( n = 6). Figure 3B shows the course of 5-HIAA levels from baseline in patients with F-NET who continued to receive LAN during the maintenance phase.

## Symptoms and Quality of Life

In  patients  with  F-NET,  occurrence  of  diarrhea  and  flushing episodes appeared to be stable or decreased at 6 and 12 months (Fig. 4). No clear differences were observed either in the combination or in the maintenance phase for the patients' QoL. During the combination phase, the mean EORTC QLQC30 global health status subscore tended to decrease from a mean of 67.2 (range, 25-100) at baseline to 63.1 (0-100) at month 6, as did the mean subscores of functional scales, representing a lower QoL and a lower level of functioning, respectively. The  mean  QLQ-C30  global  health  status  subscore essentially remained unchanged between the end of the combination  phase  and  the  end  of  the  maintenance  phase in all study groups (not shown). Similarly, only slight or no changes  were  observed  for  the  other  QLQ-C30  and  QLQGINET21 symptom subscores assessed (not shown).

## Adverse Events

Fifty-five  from  57  (96.5%)  patients  reported  treatmentemergent AEs (TEAE) in the combination and 33 from 37 (89.2%) in the maintenance phase (Table 3). TEAE mostly were NCI-CTCAE grade 1 or 2 (combination: 87.7%, maintenance: 89.2%). Forty-three (75.4%) patients presented with at  least  1 TEAE  considered  related  to  treatment.  Seventeen (29.8%) patients experienced at least 1 serious TEAE (SAE) during the combination phase and 11 (29.7%) during maintenance (Table 3). The most frequent TEAE by primary system organ class were gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders (fatigue),  and  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders.  Most common grade 3/4 events in the combination phase included nausea (14.0%), thrombocytopenia (12.3%), and neutropenia (8.8%). The incidence of hematological TEAE was higher during the combination than during the maintenance phase. TEAE reported in ≥5% of the patients (all grades) are presented in Supplementary Table S2.

During the combination phase, 9 patients (15.8%) displayed at least 1 TEAE that led to withdrawal of study medication (24 events): bile duct stenosis (3 events); jaundice, tricuspid valve  incompetence  (2  events  each);  arthralgia,  asthenia, blood bilirubin increase, cardiac failure, cholangitis, congestive cardiomyopathy, C-reactive protein increase, depression, diabetes mellitus, edema, hyperbilirubinemia, ileus, leucocytosis,  myalgia,  nausea,  seronegative  arthritis,  and  vomiting (1 event each). TEAE leading to discontinuation were serious except 5 events and not considered treatment-related except 4 events (bilirubin increase, jaundice, nausea, and vomiting) reported in 2 patients. During the maintenance phase, cholangitis resulted in the withdrawal of study medication in 1 patient from the LAN-treated NF-NET group.

During the study period, 4 deaths were reported resulting from SAE not considered related to study medication. During the combination phase, one patient with a history of diabetes and hypertension for over 10 years in addition to pneumonectomy due to lung carcinoma died of cardiac insufficiency. During maintenance, 3 patients died: one patient due to pneumonia in the group of LAN-treated patients with F-NET, and 2 patients due to multiorgan failure because of cancer progression (one in each group of patients with NF-NET).

No abnormalities in vital signs were observed throughout the  study. Abdominal ultrasound exams were performed in 5 patients during the study. In one patient, new gallbladder stones and sludge were found during the maintenance phase.

## Discussion

This is the first study to investigate in a prospective design a combination of an SSTR-directed therapy and an alkylating agent in a mixed population of patients with advanced, progressive GEP-NET or GEP-NET of unknown origin.

Almost three-quarters of patients  treated  with  LAN  plus TMZ  achieved  disease  control  at  6  months  of  treatment, which was defined as either SD, PR, or CR. In most of these patients, SD ( n = 33; 67.3%) was observed, while PR ( n = 3; 6.1%) was a rare event, and no CR was observed. Around 25% had been nonresponders to the combination therapy of LAN plus TMZ. A further 10% of patients experienced disease progression during the observation period.

Administration  of  somatostatin  analogs  is  an  established treatment of patients with metastatic NET. 6  Our study population consisted of mostly heavily pretreated patients, the vast majority of whom had previously received somatostatin analogs, and about half also had PRRT. Therefore, the patients included in this study likely presented with features of a more aggressive tumor biology and in urgent need of an effective yet tolerable follow-up therapy. In an analysis of 11 prospective trials of LAN monotherapy in advanced and/or progressive GEP-NET, PR rates generally ranged between 0% and 8% (except in one study 31%), SD rates between 15% and 89%, irrespective of prior disease progression status (reviewed by

In  the  randomized  CLARINET  trial,  67  of 101 patients (66%) treated with LAN remained alive without  progression  within  12  months  of  treatment  vs  49%  of patients on placebo. 6  However, patients with NF-NET with low proliferative activity (Ki-67 ≤10%) and mostly no disease progression at 3-6 months before start of LAN were included.

For treatment of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN), TMZ has  been  used  in  different  combinations,  most  frequently with capecitabine. In a retrospective study, in patients with advanced pancreatic NET, who mostly had documented progression,  capecitabine  and  TMZ  ( n = 100)  were  not  superior compared with TMZ alone with respect to median PFS ( n = 38). However, although not significant, a trend toward higher ORR was observed with the combination treatment than with TMZ alone (51% vs 34%; P = .088). 38 Results of a retrospective chart review study ( n = 116) showed encouraging PFS, overall survival, and ORR in patients with advanced

NEN (progression status at inclusion not provided) with a DCR of 73% with capecitabine and TMZ, 39  ie, comparable to our results. Most of the patients included had pancreatic (41%) or small intestinal NET (32%), 47% previously had received somatostatin analogs, 58% surgery, and 31% chemotherapy, similar to our patient population. According to a meta-analysis of 15 small studies-all retrospective but one-( n = 384) the DCR of capecitabine and TMZ was similar to our study (73%) and greater than with TMZ alone. 40

In  the  recently  reported  prospective  randomized  phase  II trial  ( n = 144),  in  patients  with  advanced  pancreatic  NET with documented disease progression within ≤12 months, the combination of capecitabine and TMZ resulted in a median PFS of 22.7 months, while patients treated with TMZ alone had a median PFS of 14.4 months ( P = 0.023) 21  ORR (34% and  40%,  respectively,  with  mono-  and  combination  therapy) did not differ between treatment arms. Approximately 50% of the patients in both treatment arms had concurrently received a somatostatin analog. More patients with grade 1 NET were included in the combination arm, what may have impacted the more favorable PFS with the combination therapy. The study is not directly comparable to our study since only 35% had a primary tumor in the pancreas, and the vast majority had their primary tumor at other sites of the digestive tract; this may also explain why ORR are lower in our study. More prospective data are available on the combination of LAN and TZM from the ATLANT study in thoracic carcinoids. In this 12-month prospective single-arm phase II study, 40 patients with progressive well-differentiated bronchial or thymic carcinoids were treated with combined LAN and TMZ. 41  Locally assessed DCR at 9 months was 35.0%, median PFS 37.1 weeks, suggesting that LAN and TMZ could offer an effective treatment option in these patients.

However, it remains unclear that what is the best drug for combination when using TMZ to treat GEP-NET and selection may vary by type of tumor and treatment goal. When combining TMZ with bevacizumab in a phase II study in 34 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NET (56% carcinoid, 44% pancreatic NET), an ORR of 15% and a median PFS of 11.0 months were observed. 14  With  everolimus  and TMZ, 40% of patients with advanced pancreatic G1/G2-NET of a prospective phase I/II study experienced PR, the median PFS  being  15.4  months. 16   However,  this  combination  was

associated with significant toxicity related to either everolimus (hyperglycaemia, mucositis, and pneumonitis) or TMZ (lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia). Treatment with thalidomide and TMZ in a mixed NET patient population was associated with biochemical and radiological response rates of 40% and 25%, respectively. 15

Response to TMZ therapy may vary by site of origin and is best established in pancreatic NET. In our study, LAN and TMZ were effective in all subgroups analyzed. Differences in DCR indicating a greater clinical benefit for patients with a small intestinal NET location, for patients with lower hepatic tumor  load  (≤25%),  and  for  patients  with  lower  Ki-67  or WHO grade (Ki-67 index &lt;3%; G1) probably indicate the prognostic  significance  of  these  parameters  rather  than  a specific treatment benefit. However, some patients with pancreatic NET may have had higher benefit when considering that  more  patients  with  pancreatic  NET  achieved  partial remission than patients with small intestinal NET; however, PFS  was  comparable  between  pancreatic  and  small  intestinal  NET. According to other studies, TMZ appeared to be more active in pancreatic vs other NET when combined with bevacizumab or thalidomide. 14,15  Although patient numbers were low, our findings of the DCR in LAN-treated patients with  NF-NET  being  numerically  higher  than  in  untreated patients  suggest  higher  efficacy  due  to  LAN  maintenance therapy compared with a watch-and-wait strategy. The value of maintenance LAN therapy is strengthened by the results of  the  REMINET  study  indicating  higher  DCRs  and  more durable PFS when chemotherapy in duodeno-pancreatic NET was followed after 6 months by LAN maintenance therapy as compared to placebo. 42  With respect to functional activity, more patients with F-NET reported improved or unchanged symptoms than worsening of symptoms, particularly of diarrhea,  both  at  the  end  of  the  combination  and  maintenance phases. Together with the observed reduction of 5-HIAA levels, this suggests efficacy of LAN and TMZ also in patients with hormone-producing NET.

Our study is one of the few to report MGMT methylation as well as protein expression results in relation to TMZ treatment  efficacy  in  a  prospective  design.  We  observed a  trend  toward MGMT promoter  methylation  to  reflect response  to TMZ treatment while a corresponding loss of MGMT expression could not be observed. Our results may confirm previous retrospective  studies  and  one  prospective study that indicated a putative predictive/prognostic role of MGMT promoter methylation status in NET. 21-23  However, the  2  methods  used  to  determine  MGMT status (methylation  vs  expression)  did  not  produce  consistent  results,  and MGMT methylation may be more informative than MGMT expression which is more susceptible to influencing factors. In our study, only in approximately 60% of tumors with a methylated MGMT promoter, we observed concurrent loss of  gene  expression.  Accordingly,  contradictory  results  for MGMT promoter methylation and protein expression have been reported. 21  MGMT promoter methylation and expression  thus  currently  appear  not  to  be  suitable  as  predictive markers in NET with regard to response to TMZ treatment. Further comparative studies that include a control arm without TMZ are needed.

The advantage of combining LAN with TMZ is a lower toxicity as compared to other combinations. In general, treatment  was  well-tolerated,  most  of  the  patients  experiencing grade 1 or 2 TEAE. The most frequently reported TEAE were consistent with a higher incidence particularly of gastrointestinal side effects known to be associated with LAN or TMZ treatment 8,43   and hematologic side effects which are, among others,  in  particular,  associated  with  TMZ. 43 In  9  (15.8%) patients,  TEAE  resulted  in  medication  withdrawal  during the combination phase, of whom only 4 patients discontinued due to an AE related to a study drug. Similar withdrawal rates due to AE have been reported in trials investigating efficacy and safety of targeted therapies such as everolimus, eg, a withdrawal rate of 17% in patients with advanced pancreatic NET. 44  Deaths during both treatment phases were considered unrelated  to  medication.  Previous  studies  showed  a  similar acceptable toxicity profile of TMZ, allowing safe administration with other antitumor treatments in NEN. 14-20,40

The main limitations of our study are the lack of a randomization into the combination vs monotherapy of TMZ treatment  and  the  low  number  of  patients  during  maintenance therapy in each of the subgroups, limiting the interpretation  of  the  results. Therefore,  we  cannot  demonstrate to what extent either lanreotide or TMZ contributed to the effect  of  combined  treatment  or  whether  this  combination resulted in a synergistic effect. Moreover, the limited exposure to combination therapy of 6 months may have impacted the PFS results while in other studies TMZ-based therapy is given for up to 12 months. Patients were included in the trial based on tumor progression within 12 months, however, data on the time frame of progression were not available for the different  primary  sites.  Finally,  subgroup  analyses  resulted in small patient numbers and hence these data may only be interpreted as explorative. Especially, due to the low number of patients with unknown primary of less than 10% of the total population, we cannot draw any conclusions from the results obtained in this patient group. On the other hand, one of the strengths of the study is central assessment of imaging and of biochemical data minimizing potential observer and inter-test variabilities as well as assessment of MGMT status in a prospective design. Furthermore, this study provides  prospective  data  on TMZ-based  therapy  in  digestive nonpancreatic NET.

The findings of this phase II study show that treatment with  LAN  120  mg/4  weeks  and  TMZ  is  feasible  and  a potential treatment option for patients with progressive For NF-NET irrespective of the primary site in the digestive tract. Clinical benefit should be confirmed in a future randomized clinical trial specifically designed to evaluate the role of TMZ in nonpancreatic NET, and further evaluating the role of maintenance therapy of LAN after chemotherapy.

## Abstract

Prospective data are lacking on early somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy in bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (BP-NETs; typical carcinoids and atypical carcinoids (TCs and ACs)). SPINET (EudraCT: 2015-004992-62; NCT02683941) was a phase III, double-blind study of lanreotide autogel/depot (LAN; 120 mg every 28 days) plus best supportive care (BSC) vs placebo plus BSC, with an optional open-label treatment phase (LAN plus BSC). Patients had metastatic/unresectable, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-positive TCs or ACs. Recruitment was stopped early owing to slow accrual; eligible patients from the double-blind phase transitioned to open-label LAN. The adapted primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) during either phase for patients receiving LAN. Seventy-seven patients were randomized (LAN, n = 51 (TCs, n = 29; ACs, n = 22); placebo, n = 26 (TCs, n = 16; ACs, n = 10)). Median (95% CI) PFS during double-blind and open-label phases in patients receiving LAN was 16.6 (11.3; 21.9) months overall (primary endpoint), 21.9 (12.8, not calculable (NC)) months in TCs, and 13.8 (5.4; 16.6) months in ACs. During double-blind treatment, median (95% CI) PFS was 16.6 (11.3; 21.9) months for LAN vs 13.6 (8.3; NC) months for placebo (not significant); corresponding values were 21.9 (13.8; NC) and 13.9 (13.4; NC) months, respectively, in TCs and 13.8 (5.4; 16.6) and 11.0 (2.8; 16.9) months, respectively, in ACs. Patients' quality of life did not deteriorate and LAN was

well tolerated. Although recruitment stopped early and the predefined sample size was not met, SPINET is the largest prospective study to date of SSA therapy in SSTR-positive TCs and ACs and suggests clinical benefit in TCs.

## Introduction

Bronchopulmonary (BP) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs;  typical  carcinoids  and  atypical  carcinoids  (TCs and  ACs))  account  for  20-25%  of  NETs  and  1-2%  of lung  malignancies  (Öberg et al. 2012,  Filosso et al. 2018,  Baudin et  al. 2021).  In  patients  with  metastatic TCs or ACs, median overall survival was reported to be 80.9 months, ranging from 33 to 105 months according to prognostic factors (Robelin et al. 2019).

Many NETs overexpress somatostatin receptors (SSTRs),  leading  to  the  development  of  somatostatin analogs  (SSAs)  as  antisecretory  and  antiproliferative treatments  across  different  NET  primaries  (Del  OlmoGarcia et al. 2021).  Two  SSAs  have  been  shown  to significantly  delay  progression  or  death  in  metastatic gastrointestinal  NETs:  lanreotide  autogel/depot  (LAN) in patients with slowly progressive well- or moderately differentiated gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs (Caplin et  al. 2014),  and  octreotide  long-acting  release (OCT) in patients with well-differentiated midgut NETs and  a  mainly  low  hepatic  tumor  burden  (Rinke et  al. 2009 ).  SSAs  also  have  favorable  tolerability  profiles and  are  the  initial  mainstay  of  medical  treatment  for gastrointestinal NETs with a good prognosis.

TCs  and  ACs  express  SSTRs,  providing  a  rationale  for their  treatment  with  SSAs  (Vesterinen et al. 2019). However, when the current study (SPINET) was designed, the data on the use of SSAs in patients with these tumors  were  limited  to those from  a small subgroup  ( n =  11)  of  the  RADIANT-2  study  (Pavel et  al. 2011)  and  retrospective  analyses  (Lopez et  al. 2014, Karra et al. 2015, Sullivan et al. 2015), and LAN was not yet  recommended  as  an  antiproliferative  treatment for TCs and ACs in US and European guidelines (Öberg et  al. 2012,  Kunz et  al. 2013).  The  SPINET  study  was designed  to  address  this  unmet  need  by  prospectively evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  LAN  in  patients with SSTR-positive TCs and ACs.

## Materials and methods

Enrollment began in July 2016. In July 2018, recruitment was stopped owing to slow accrual, resulting primarily  from  changes  to  US  and  EU  guidelines.  The protocol was amended, including the primary objective and  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  (see  below). Eligible  patients  still  receiving  treatment  during  the double-blind phase could enter the open-label treatment phase to receive open-label LAN.

## Patients

Full  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  are  summarized in Supplementary Table S1 (see section on supplementary materials given at the end of this article). Patients,  who  were  enrolled  by  study  investigators at specialist centers, were eligible if they were aged ≥ 18 years and had metastatic and/or unresectable, pathologically confirmed TCs or ACs with positive SSTR imaging.  They  also  needed  at  least  one  measurable lesion of the disease on CT or MRI (Response Evaluation Criteria  in  Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  v1.1  (Eisenhauer et al. 2009))  and  an  Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology Group  (ECOG)  performance  status  score  of  0  or  1. Patients  were  excluded  if  they  had  received  previous SSA  treatment,  more  than  two  lines  of  chemotherapy (cytotoxic,  molecular  targeted  therapy,  or  interferonalpha)  for  TCs/ACs,  or  chemotherapy  in  the  4  weeks before randomization, or if they had functional disease requiring SSA treatment for symptom management.  No  assessment  of  disease  progression was  performed  before  study  entry  (not  an  inclusion criterion).

## Study design and interventions

SPINET (EudraCT: 2015-004992-62; NCT02683941) was a phase III,  prospective,  multicenter,  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with an optional open-label LAN treatment phase and an open-label  follow-up  phase.  Patients  were  randomly allocated (2:1) to receive subcutaneous injections every 28 days with LAN (120 mg) plus best supportive care  (BSC)  or  placebo  plus  BSC,  with  randomization stratified by TC vs AC and prior vs no prior chemotherapy (see Supplementary Material for information about randomization and blinding).

The  plan  was  to  enroll  216  patients  across  Canada, Europe,  and  the  USA,  but  recruitment  was  stopped early  owing  to  slow  accrual.  Before  recruitment  was stopped,  patients  receiving  a  placebo  with  centrally confirmed progression (RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al. 2009)) during the double-blind phase could enter the  open-label  treatment  phase  to  receive  LAN  plus BSC.  After  recruitment  was  stopped,  eligible  patients remaining in the double-blind phase (i.e. patients receiving LAN  without  centrally confirmed  disease progression and patients receiving placebo) could transition to open-label LAN + BSC.

The  study  ended  18  months  after  the  last  patient  was randomized, in February 2020.

## Assessments and endpoints

To  assess  disease  progression,  patients  underwent  a CT or MRI scan at baseline and every 12 weeks during the  study.  Procedures  for  local  and  central  review are  summarized  in  Supplementary  Fig.  S1.  If  locally assessed disease progression was not confirmed centrally,  the  local  decision  prevailed,  in  accordance with  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  requirements. Other assessments during the study are summarized in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.

Some endpoints  were  amended  after  recruitment  was stopped.  The  primary  endpoint  was  changed  from centrally confirmed progression-free survival (PFS) during  the  double-blind  phase  to  centrally  confirmed PFS  during  the  double-blind  or  open-label  treatment phases for patients  randomized  to  LAN  only;  PFS endpoints for LAN vs placebo became secondary endpoints.  Key  secondary  endpoints,  assessed  for  the LAN and placebo groups during the double-blind phase, were centrally and locally assessed PFS, objective response  rate  (ORR),  and  time  to  treatment  failure (TTF).  Other  secondary  endpoints,  assessed  during  the double-blind and open-label treatment phases, included changes  in  the  European  Organization  for  Research and Treatment  of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30), proportions of patients with  a  deterioration  in  QLQ-C30  scores  (≥  10-point decrease),  and  changes  in  biomarker  levels  (serum chromogranin (CgA) and urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA); see Supplementary Material). Exploratory  endpoints  included  clinical  benefit  rate (CBR), defined as the proportion of patients with complete response,  partial  response,  or  stable  disease, and  tumor  growth  rate  (TGR)  during  the  double-blind and open-label treatment phases. Safety endpoints were treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), laboratory parameters (hematology and biochemistry), vital  signs,  and  ECG  results.  Patients  had  gallbladder echography  if  biological  abnormalities  and/or  clinical inflammatory symptoms occurred during the study.

## Statistical analysis

The planned sample size was 216 patients (LAN, n =  144; placebo, n =  72;  i.e.  2:1  ratio),  based  on  90%  power  to detect  a  clinically  meaningful  treatment  difference  of 4  months  for  PFS  (10  months  for  LAN  and  6  months for  placebo;  i.e.  an  expected  hazard  ratio  (HR)  of  0.6), with a type 1 error rate of 0.05.

The  intention-to-treat  (ITT)  population  comprised  all patients  randomly  assigned  to  study  treatment.  The open-label  ITT  population  comprised  all  ITT  patients who entered the open-label treatment phase and received  at  least  one  LAN  injection  during  this  phase.

The safety population included all patients who received at least one injection of study medication.

PFS  and  TTF  were  analyzed  using  the  Kaplan-Meier product  limit  method.  Associated  HRs  were  estimated using a  stratified  Cox  proportional  hazards  model, and  95%  CIs  were  calculated  using  the  BrookmeyerCrowley  method.  For  ORR,  CBR,  and  the  proportions of patients with decreases in biomarker CgA and QLQC30 scores, 95% CIs were calculated using the ClopperPearson  method.  Statistical  significance  was  assessed using a stratified log-rank test.

TGR  was  calculated  from  radiologic  scans  in  the  12 months  before  the  study,  at  baseline,  and  every  12 weeks during the study, and estimated using the sum  of  diameters  of  target  lesions  (100  (exp(3  log (D t /D0)/ t )  -  1))  (D0  and  D t =  tumor  sizes  at  times  0  and t ).  Given  that  the  provision  of  historical  scans  was optional,  TGR  at  baseline  could  only  be  computed  for the  subgroup  of  patients  for  whom  historical  scans were available.

Statistical analyses were performed with SAS ®  software, v9.4 or higher (SAS Institute, Inc.).

## Ethical approval

The  study was  conducted  in compliance  with  the Declaration  of  Helsinki,  the  International  Conference on  Harmonization  Good  Clinical  Practice  guidelines, and institutional review board/independent ethics committee  requirements.  All  patients  had  to  provide written informed consent before enrollment.

## Results

## Patients

Overall,  77  patients  were  enrolled  (51  randomized to  LAN,  26  to  placebo)  (Fig.  1);  21  in  the  LAN  group and  19  in  the  placebo  group  received  LAN  during the  open-label  treatment  phase  (Fig.  1).  Given  that recruitment  was  stopped  prematurely,  the  planned sample  size  was  not  met,  and  statistical  analyses  are considered  descriptive.  The  median  (range)  on-study duration was 13.1 (1-34) months (double-blind phase), 8.1 (0-21) months (open-label treatment phase), and 22.8 (2-36) months (overall). Five patients (9.8%) in the LAN group and four patients (15.4%) in the placebo group had received prior systemic therapy (Table 1).

Overall,  the  mean  ( s.d. )  age  was  66.2  (12.5)  years,  and 54.5%  of  patients  were  male.  Among  them,  58.4% had  TCs  (29  patients  in  the  LAN  arm  and  16  patients in  the  placebo  arm)  and  41.6%  had  ACs  (22  patients in  the  LAN  arm  and  10  patients  in  the  placebo  arm (Table  1)).  There  were  some  imbalances  in  baseline characteristics  between  the  two  groups,  including  the median  time  since  diagnosis  and  the  proportion  of patients with ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S4).

## Efficacy

## Primary endpoint

The  median  (95%  CI)  centrally  assessed  PFS  in  LANrandomized patients during the double-blind and open-label treatment phases was 16.6 (11.3; 21.9) months  (Fig. 2A and  Supplementary  Table  S5). In subgroups  of  patients  with  TCs  and  ACs,  the  median (95% CI) centrally assessed PFS during the double-blind and  open-label  phases  was  21.9  (12.8;  not  calculable (NC)) and 13.8 (5.4; 16.6) months, respectively (Fig. 2B).

## Secondary and exploratory endpoints

During  the  double-blind  phase,  the  median  (95%  CI) centrally  assessed  PFS  was  16.6  (11.3;  21.9)  months for  LAN  vs  13.6  (8.3;  NC)  months  for  placebo,  but  the difference  was  not  statistically significant  (HR  0.94 (95%  CI  0.48;  1.95); P =  0.866)  (Fig.  2C).  The  median (95%  CI)  centrally  assessed  PFS  in  patients  with  TCs was  21.9  (13.8;  NC)  months  for  LAN  and  13.9  (13.4; NC) months for placebo (Fig. 2D); the median (95% CI) centrally  assessed  PFS  in  patients  with  ACs  was  13.8 (5.4; 16.6) months and 11.0 (2.8; 16.9) months, respectively (Fig. 2E). PFS based on local assessments is summarized in Supplementary Table S6.

During  the  double-blind  phase,  the  centrally  assessed ORR  was  14.0%  for  LAN  and  0%  for  placebo,  but  the difference  was  not  statistically  significant  ( Table  2). CBR  was  similar  (90.0%  vs  92.0%)  between  the  two groups  (Table  2).  TTF  (median  (95%  CI))  was  13.3 (5.6;  14.1)  months  for  LAN  vs  9.8  (5.4;  13.6)  months for  placebo  (HR  0.86  (95%  CI,  0.50;  1.50)),  but  this difference  was  not  statistically  significant  ( P =  0.582) (Fig.  3);  see  Supplementary  Table  S7  for  reasons  for treatment failure. The ORR for LAN was 6.0% on local assessment and 14.0% on central assessment. The ORR and  CBR  based  on  local  assessments  are  summarized in  Supplementary  Table  S8  and  further  information provided in the Supplementary Material.

EORTC  QLQ-C30  scores  during  the  double-blind  phase and  open-label  phase  are  shown  in  Supplementary Figs  S2  and  S3.  In  the  double-blind  phase,  EORTC QLQ-C30  scores  (Supplementary  Fig.  S2)  were  similar between the LAN and placebo groups; for example, at week  48,  the  mean  (95%  CI)  changes  were  -6.3  (-12.6; -0.1) and -4.2 (-18.2; 9.8) for global health status scores, respectively. The proportions of patients with a ≥ 10-point decrease (deterioration) in QLQ-C30 global scores were  broadly  similar  in  the  LAN  and  placebo  groups (Supplementary Table S9).

At  baseline,  the  mean  (95%  CI)  TGR  was  14.2%  (3.86; 24.49%)  per  month  for  LAN  ( n =  15)  and  2.6%  (-8.11; 13.32%) per month for placebo ( n =  7).  At  week  12,  the mean  (95%  CI)  change  from  baseline  (%/month)  in TGR  was  -11.8%  (-22.51;  -1.15%)  and  +11.0%  (-3.99; 26.00%), respectively. Results obtained during the remainder  of  the  double-blind  phase  are  summarized in Supplementary Table S10.

## Safety

During  the  double-blind  phase,  TEAEs  were  reported for  similar  proportions  of  patients  in  the  LAN  and placebo  groups  (96.1%  and  96.2%,  respectively);  in most  cases,  the  events  were  of  grade  1  or  2  severity (Table  3).  TEAEs  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation were reported in two patients (3.9%) receiving LAN  and  three patients (11.5%) receiving placebo (Table 3). Serious TEAEs were reported in ten patients (19.6%) and seven patients (26.9%), respectively (treatment-related  in  2 (3.9%) and  1  (3.8%)  cases). Treatment-related TEAEs during the double-blind phase  were  reported  in  74.5%  of  patients  receiving LAN  and  in  53.8%  of  those  receiving  placebo.  The most  common  treatment-related  TEAEs  in  the  LAN group were diarrhea (52.9%; 15.4% for placebo), upper  abdominal  pain/abdominal  pain  (11.8%;  15.4% for  placebo),  fatigue  (11.8%;  15.4%  for  placebo),  and flatulence  (11.8%;  3.8%  for  placebo)  (Supplementary Table S11).

During the open-label treatment phase, TEAEs, irrespective of causality, were reported in 88.9% of patients in the placebo  (no progressive disease [NPD])-LAN  group,  90.0%  in  the  placebo  (progressive disease)-LAN  group,  and  42.9%  in  the  LAN  (NPD)LAN group; treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 44.4%, 60.0%, and 14.3% of patients, respectively (Table  3).  There  were  no  TEAEs  leading  to  treatment discontinuation, and only one serious TEAE (hyperglycemia, not related to treatment) was reported. Compared  with baseline, there were no clinically relevant changes in mean  values  for hematologic, randomly assigned to LAN (by tumor subtype). (C) During the doubleblind phase in patients randomly assigned to LAN or placebo (overall patient population). (D) During the double-blind phase in patients randomly assigned to LAN or placebo (in patients with typical carcinoids). (E) During the double-blind phase in patients randomly assigned to LAN or placebo (in patients with atypical carcinoids). Data from patients who did not die and did not have confirmed disease progression were censored on the date of the last radiological assessment at which the target lesions were evaluated by central review. a One patient was excluded from the analysis because their data were censored at baseline (because the baseline assessment was prior to randomization, this would have yielded a negative PFS). PFS in months was calculated as follows: (date of event - date of randomization) / 30.4375.

Time to treatment failure during the double-blind phase (ITT population). TTF was defined as the time from randomization to: documented central or local PD (defined as the minimum time to event according to central/ local review using RECIST v1.1); treatment discontinuation for undocumented disease progression; treatment discontinuation for toxicity or any other reason; start of new anticancer treatment; withdrawal of consent; an AE; a protocol deviation; loss to follow-up; appearance of carcinoid syndrome or other hormone-related syndrome necessitating the initiation of SSAs (rescue octreotide and/or long-acting release SSA); death between adequate assessment visits; death before first PD assessment; prohibited medication/therapy or unblinded event. TTF in months was calculated as follows: (date of event -date of randomization)/30.4375. AE, adverse event; HR, hazard ratio; ITT, intention-to-treat; LAN, lanreotide autogel/depot; PD, progressive disease; RECIST, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; SSA, somatostatin analog; TTF, time to treatment failure.

SPINET  is  the  first  phase  III,  randomized,  placebocontrolled study to evaluate early SSA therapy in patients with TCs and ACs. It provides clinically important evidence regarding the use of LAN  in patients  with  these  tumors,  for  whom  few  treatment options are available. Although recruitment was stopped  prematurely  and  the  predefined  sample  size was  not  met,  the  combined  results  of  the  primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints suggest that LAN has  clinical  activity,  most  obviously  in  the  medically important subgroup with TCs, where the median numerical  improvement  in  centrally  assessed  PFS  vs placebo  was  8  months.  Indeed,  the  21.9-month  PFS for  LAN  in  patients  with  TCs  reported  in  SPINET  falls within  the  range  of  14.3  months  (time  to  progression (TTP))  to  38.5  months  (PFS)  reported  for  OCT  in  the PROMID  trial  (patients  with  metastatic  midgut  NETs) or LAN in the CLARINET trial (patients with advanced enteropancreatic NETs), respectively (Rinke et al. 2009,  Caplin et  al. ).  The  PFS  with  placebo  in  SPINET (13.9  months)  is  also  within  the  range  reported  for placebo in the PROMID (TTP, 6.0 months) and CLARINET (PFS, 18.0 months) trials (Rinke et al. 2009, Caplin et al. 2014).  In  addition  to  the  smaller-than-planned  sample size,  factors  that  may  have  limited  the  extent  of  the difference between treatment arms include tumor progression before enrollment not being a prerequisite (as  in  the  PROMID  trial  (Rinke et  al. 2009)),  and  the potentially  higher  TGR  in  the  LAN  arm.  In  addition to  the  numerical  improvement  in  PFS,  there  were greater  reductions  in  serum  CgA  and  in  TGR  in  the LAN  arm.  TGR,  a  predictive  marker  for  progression and survival, is useful for assessing slow-growing tumors  like  NETs,  and  it  has  previously  been  shown that  LAN  significantly  decreased  TGR  in  patients  with

Median (range) duration of treatment exposure during the double-blind phase was 12.9 (1-33) months in the LAN group and 11.6 (1-24) months in the PBO group; during the open-label treatment phase, it was 7.5 (5-9) months in the LAN (NPD)-LAN group, 8.4 (3-12) months in the PBO (NPD)-LAN group, and 13.5 (1-21) months in the PBO (PD)-LAN group.

Data from the double-blind phase are from the safety population and those from the open-label treatment phase are from the open-label ITT population. a Carcinoid syndrome ( n = 1)  and Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in the LAN group, and abdominal pain ( n = 1), musculoskeletal chest pain ( n = 1),  and pneumonia ( n = 1) in the placebo group;  b Incidence ≥ 15% in any treatment group; c Preferred terms of abdominal pain or upper abdominal pain have been combined.

GEP-NETs (Dromain et al. 2021). Patients' health-related quality  of  life  did  not  deteriorate  during  treatment  in the present study, and LAN was well tolerated, having a safety profile consistent with that well established in NETs  (Bianchi et  al. 2011,  Martín-Richard et  al. 2013, Caplin et al. 2014, Michael et al. 2017, Godara et al. 2019, Caplin et al. 2021, Ito et al. 2021, Rinke et al. 2021).

The  main  reason  for  the  slow  accrual  of  patients  into SPINET was the increasing use of SSAs for TCs and ACs in  clinical  practice;  as  such,  patients  were  reluctant to  enroll  in  this  study,  with  the  risk  of  receiving  a placebo,  when  they  could  access  the  active  treatment with  a  prescription.  The  increase  in  SSA  use  probably reflects changes to guidelines ( Caplin et al. 2015, Kulke et  al. 2015),  which  were  updated to recommend the use of SSAs/LAN as first-line antiproliferative treatment  in  SSTR-positive  TCs  and  ACs  to  discourage the  early  use  of  platinum-based  chemotherapy.  At  the time  the  guidelines  changed,  recommendations  were based  mainly  on  the  extrapolation  of  findings  from research  in  GEP-NETs  (LAN)  (Caplin et al. 2014)  or

midgut  NETs  (OCT)  studies  (Rinke et  al. 2009),  as  well as limited data on the use of SSAs for TCs and ACs from a  subgroup  analysis  of  the  RADIANT-2  study  (OCT  vs everolimus  plus  OCT)  (Pavel et al. 2011)  and  three retrospective studies published as abstracts (Lopez et al. 2014 , Karra et al. 2015 , Sullivan et al. 2015).

After SPINET  was  initiated, data from  a phase  II study  (LUNA)  of  SSA  therapy  (which  included  patients with progressive TCs and ACs) were published, providing  the  first  prospective  signal  that  SSAs  (as well  as  everolimus  alone  and  everolimus  plus  SSA) may  have  antiproliferative  effects  in  these  patients (Ferolla et  al. 2017).  However,  LUNA  was  conducted in patients receiving mainly post-first-line therapy with progressive tumors according to RECIST v1.1 and included a small number of patients with thymic NETs, so  its  data  are  not  directly  comparable  with  SPINET data. Since then, the first data on cytotoxic chemotherapy, from the prospective,  phase  II  ATLANT study  (LAN  plus  temozolomide; n =  40),  have  been published (Ferolla et al. 2023). ATLANT included patients  with  progressive  TCs  (20.0%),  ACs  (52.5%),  or unspecified  carcinoids  (27.5%)  who  had  received  ≤1 line  of  treatment  with  SSA.  The  study  demonstrated an  investigator-assessed  disease  control  rate  (DCR)  at 9 months (primary endpoint) of 35% (partial response, 2.5%);  however,  this  was  not  statistically  significant  at a  30% threshold ( P =  0.2968)  and  the  primary  endpoint was  not  met.  Median  PFS  was  37.1  weeks,  and  32.5% of patients experienced TEAEs that led to the interruption of study medication. In a sensitivity analysis conducted using investigator assessments between months 7.5 and 10.5,  DCR  was  45.0%  (partial response, 7.5%), which was statistically significant at a 30% threshold ( P =  0.0320)  (Ferolla et  al. 2023).  From  a clinical  perspective,  these  results  do  not  favor  the  use of  temozolomide  as  first-line  therapy  in  patients  with TCs  (Baudin et  al. 2021).  Another  treatment  option  is the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, which is now licensed to  treat  unresectable  or  metastatic  progressive  TCs and ACs (based on the phase III RADIANT-4 study (Yao et  al. 2016)  and  subgroup  analysis  (Fazio et  al. 2018)). However,  similar  to  temozolomide  (Taherifard et  al. 2024 ),  the  safety  and  tolerability  profile  of  everolimus (Faggiano et al. 2016) is generally  considered less favorable than that of LAN (Faggiano 2024), and some suggest that its risk/benefit profile may be more appropriate for use in patients with clinically significant disease progression (Cives &amp; Strosberg 2018). The latest European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines recommend SSA therapy rather than everolimus as  first-line  treatment  in  TC  and  slowly  progressing SSTR-positive lung carcinoids because it is better tolerated (Baudin et al. 2021).

This  study  has  several  limitations,  the  most  important of  which  is  that  the  predefined  sample  size  was  not met. The earlier-than-planned transition to the open-label treatment phase reduced the period of observation during the double-blind phase and further limited treatment comparisons and the clinical interpretation  of  the  data.  However,  the  median  PFS in  SPINET  is  consistent  with  that  reported  in  other retrospective  and  prospective  studies  of  patients  with TCs  and  ACs.  In  these  studies,  median  PFS  ranged from  8.5  months  in  patients  with  progressive  disease at  study  entry  to  17.4  months  in  patients  with  mixed progression  status  at  baseline  (Sullivan et al. 2015, Bongiovanni et al. 2017, Ferolla et al. 2017). In addition,  the  median  PFS  of  both  arms  in  SPINET  is consistent  with  the  TTP  and  PFS  results  reported  in phase III trials in patients with midgut and enteropancreatic  NETs  (Caplin et  al. 2021,  Rinke et  al. 2009).  The  conservative  estimate  of  median  PFS  (10 months  for  LAN  and  6  months  for  placebo)  for  the sample size hypothesis was based on the limited evidence (PFS and TTP) in patients with BP-NETs (Pavel et  al. 2011, Lopez et  al. 2014, Sullivan et  al. 2015, Karra et al. 2015 , Fazio et al. 2016 ) and midgut NETs (Rinke et al. 2009) that was available at the time of study design.

As  noted  earlier,  the  most  important  limitation  of the  study  is  the  reduced  sample  size,  which  affected data  interpretation  and  probably  explains  the  lack  of significance  between  LAN  and  placebo  for  centrally assessed PFS. In addition, progressive disease  was not  an  entry  criterion  for  the  study,  which  means that  it  was  not  possible  to  formally  evaluate  disease stabilization;  however,  the  randomized  nature  of  the trial  was  implemented  to  overcome  this  limitation. Another  limitation is the difference in results for central and local assessment of tumor response, which may reflect variability in the assessment of metastases and  differences  in  target  lesion  selection  in  slowly progressive  NETs,  as  noted  in  the  RADIANT-2  study (Pavel et  al. 2011),  and  a  higher  rate  of  false  positive targets in the thoracic area. In SPINET, in two patients where central and local responses differed, the numbers of  baseline  target  lesions  were  different  in  central and  local  assessments.  The  challenges  associated  with assessing baseline target lesions in patients with NETs are  well  known  (Abramson et al. 2015),  hence  the robust  central  assessment  process  adopted  in  SPINET (two readers, with adjudication in the event of differences in opinion). Although some  differences between  local  and  central  assessment  were  observed during  the  study,  it  was  only  in  a  single  patient  that this  difference  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  tumor response. This patient had two measurable but small  target  lesions  at  baseline  (16  mm  and  18  mm on  central  measurement  and  19  mm  and  18  mm  on local  assessment);  one  of  these  lesions  became  nonmeasurable on central assessment only. A further limitation includes minor imbalances in baseline characteristics between treatment arms; however, the final clinical relevance of these imbalances  is unpredictable. It should also be noted that data on the median  time  from  the  onset  of  metastatic  disease  to the start of treatment are not available.

Strengths  of the study  include  that it  enrolled  an international population and was a dedicated, prospective  evaluation  of  early  SSA  therapy  for  TCs and ACs, and that it represents the largest prospective study to date of early SSA use in this setting. Based on data  from  countries  permitting  the  collection  of  race data, the racial diversity of the study population was  limited  because  most  patients  were  European; nevertheless, disease characteristics were generally as  expected  of  those  with  TCs  and  ACs  in  clinical practice.  As  per  regulatory  requirements  (Zhang et  al. 2018 ),  there  was  a  robust,  well-established,  first-line central  assessment  of  PFS  that,  nonetheless,  allowed individualized  care  of  patients  to  continue.  Thus,  the study provides clinically important data.

The  difficulties  faced  in  the  SPINET  study  prompt some  important  reflections  on  missed  opportunities to provide the best level of evidence achievable through  the  completion  of  a  phase  III  trial,  especially in  rare  cancers.  At  the  time  SPINET  was  designed, conducting a dedicated phase III study was considered feasible  based  on  the  estimated  incidence  (~1.5  per 100,000  (Öberg et  al. 2012)).  More  importantly,  it  was anticipated  that  it  would  offer  significant  benefits  to participants (including those initially treated with placebo, who could transition to LAN in the open-label treatment phase), as well as patients  whose treatment would  be  informed  by  its  outcomes.  With  hindsight, optimal changes to treatment guidelines in these circumstances might have included advocating strongly for SSA treatment via clinical trial participation when possible, as an alternative to off-label prescription. It is  also  the  case,  however, that meeting the best interests of patients and increasing recruitment into the study would have been possible with increased  awareness  among  thoracic surgeons and pneumologists, as well as  improved standardization  in  the  way  in  which  TCs  and  ACs  are characterized  in  expert  NET  centers  and  in  the  use  of prognostic factors to guide treatment decisions.

In conclusion, despite lower-than-target enrollment, SPINET  is  the  largest  prospective  study  to  date  of SSA  therapy  in  SSTR-positive  TCs  and  ACs.  The  study provides  clinically  important  data  about  the  activity and  tolerability  profile  of  LAN  120  mg  every  28  days in unresectable and/or metastatic BP-NETs. The results of  SPINET  thus  provide  much-needed  data  to  support the  clinical  use  of  SSAs  in  BP-NETs,  mainly  TCs,  as recommended by European and US guidelines.

Background: There is limited evidence regarding the benefit of adding somatostatin analogs to molecular targeted agents for well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). This phase III trial was conducted to compare everolimus plus lanreotide (EVE/LAN) with everolimus monotherapy (EVE) in patients with unresectable or recurrent GEP-NETs in the first-line setting. Methods: Patients with grade 1 or grade 2, nonfunctioning GEP-NETs with poor prognostic factors (Ki-67 labeling index (LI) 5-20% or diffuse liver metastases) were randomly assigned (1:1) to EVE (10 mg/day) or EVE/LAN (EVE + LAN 120 mg every 28 days). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The key secondary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and other secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and safety. The study was based on the hypothesis of an assumed median PFS of 11.0 months for EVE, expecting a 4-month improvement by EVE/LAN (HR: 0.73). The planned sample size was 250, requiring 195 events overall with a one-sided alpha level of 5%, a power of 70%, an accrual period of 5 years, and a follow-up period of 1.5 years. Results: Between April 2020 and June 2024, a total of 178 patients were enrolled, and the planned interim analysis was conducted in 145 patients (72 in the EVE and 73 in the EVE/LAN) in June 2024 with a data cut-off date of Nov 2023. The median PFS was 11.5 months in the EVE arm and 29.7 months in the EVE/LAN arm (HR 0.38 [99.91% CI 0.15 -0.96], P = 0.00017 , the prespecified significance level of 0.00046, by the stratified log-rank test). The HR for OS was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.24-3.90). The ORR and DCR were 8.7% (6/69) and 87.0% (60/69) in the EVE arm and 26.8% (19/71) and 91.5% (65/71) in the EVE/LAN arm, respectively. Both hematologic andnon-hematologictoxicities tended to be more frequent in the EVE/LAN arm than in the EVE arm. No treatment-related deaths were observed in either arm. Based on the efficacy results, the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended early termination of the study. Conclusions: The EVE/LAN provides statistically significant prolongation of PFS compared with EVE monotherapy, and the safety profile of EVE/LAN was manageable. The EVE/LAN might be a new standard treatment in the first-line setting for welldifferentiated grade 1/2 GEP-NETs with poor prognostic factors. Clinical trial information: jRCT1031200023.
