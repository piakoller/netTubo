Type I gNETs are indolent,\nwith negligible risk of metastases (<5%) and excellent long-term sur-\nvival (almost 100%); the prognosis of a patient with type II gNETs\nneeds to be assessed in the context of MEN-I syndrome; however,\nthe risk of metastases may vary between 10% and 30%. Type III\ntumours are usually more aggressive, owing to the high prevalence\nof metastatic disease (>50%) and the more unfavourable long-term\nsurvival (5-year survival rate 70%), although they present well-\ndifferentiated morphology in the majority of cases. Type III gNENs\nmay also have higher grades. The key questions discussed in the pre-\nsent paper are summarised in Table 1. Data were identified by MED-\nLINE database searches and expert opinion/recommendations given\naccording to the best available evidence and the authors’ experi-\nence. Each recommendation for treatment and diagnosis will have a\nlevel of evidence and grade of recommendation as per the GRADE\nsystem (Table S1). The major features of gNETs are summarised in\nTable 2.\n1.2\n|\nAssessment of gastric neuroendocrine\ntumours\n1.2.1\n|\nPathology\nGastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs) are different from other\ngastrointestinal NETs as in the stomach a clear aetiology is emerging\nwhere gastric NETs are induced in the context of hyperplasia of\nenterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. In 1993 an aetiological framework\nfor gastric NETs was reported,2 where gastric NETs were either\nfound in a setting of ECL cell hyperplasia associated with high gas-\ntrin levels due to autoimmune fundic atrophic gastritis (type I NETs),\nhigh gastrin levels due to gastrinoma (type II NETs) or without ECL\nhyperplasia (type III NETs). More recently, general atrophy in chronic\nH. pylori associated gastritis,3 functional failure of parietal cells due\nto mutations4 or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use5 have also been\nreported to be associated with NETs, some with a background of\nECL cell hyperplasia but in cases of proton pump inhibition also\nassociated with parietal cell hyperplasia. These newly described gas-\ntric NETs are similar to the originally described type I gNETs as they\nare secondary to failed acid secretion. The secondary (type I and\ntype II) gNETs have a more indolent course2,5 and can be reversible\nif the cause can be impeded. It is therefore important to recognise\nthe associated gastric mucosal changes.6\nAdequate tumour sampling is essential for grading NETs as pre-\nscribed in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of gas-\ntrointestinal tumours of 2019.7 As NETs are usually located deep in\nthe mucosa (not at the surface) attention should be paid to this when\ntaking biopsies.\nGastric NETs are graded using the same criteria as for all gastroin-\ntestinal sites:8\nG1: mitotic count <2 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index <3% in hotspot\nof at least 500 cells.\nG2: mitotic count between 2 and 20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index\nbetween 3% and 20% in hotspot of at least 500 cells.\nG3: mitotic count >20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20% in hot-\nspot of at least 500 cells.\n1.2.2\n|\nEndoscopy\nThe primary diagnostic tool for gNETs is oesophagogastroduode-\nnoscopy (OGD). For the assessment of gastric NETs, not only rep-\nresentative biopsies of the tumour but also biopsies of the\nsurrounding mucosa and other parts of the stomach (antrum and\nbody-fundus) are essential as these give clues on the nature/\naetiology and, with this, the prognosis and treatment of the NET.\nIn addition, sampling of gastric juice for pH measurement is\nstrongly encouraged. Furthermore, virtual chromoendoscopy (nar-\nrow-band imaging, blue light imaging, i-scan) may be useful to pro-\nvide\nadditional\ninformation\nto\nidentify\nfield\nchanges\nor\nprecancerous lesions in underlying atrophic mucosa.9 In addition\nto OGD, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be performed in all\nlesions >1 cm regardless of type and in all lesions of type III\nregardless of size, unless large or metastatic lesions are found.\nReporting should include size of the lesion infiltration depth and\nassessment of local lymph nodes.\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of gNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to evaluate proliferative activity of the tumour (Ki67\nand/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\nTABLE 1\nList of questions.\nGASTRIC NET\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic resection for type I gNETs?

Evaluation of the type of gNET by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n1.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nBiomarker assessment should include fasting gastrin and chromo-\ngranin A (CgA). Whereas gastrin may be useful to differentiate\nbetween different types (elevated in type I and type II, normal in\ntype III), CgA is only useful as a tumour marker in type III gNETs.\nIn the presence of ongoing PPI therapy gastrin and CgA are not\ndiagnostic and are difficult to interpret. In general, caution should\nbe used when evaluating CgA values, considering the different\ndiagnostic accuracy of available assays. Parietal cell and intrinsic\nfactor antibodies, vitamin B12 and thyroid function parameters\nshould be measured in suspected cases of autoimmune gastritis.\nWhereas type I gNETs do not usually require additional cross-\nsectional imaging, type III gNETs should undergo cross-sectional\nimaging – liver contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nand/or contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography\n(CT), with previous ingestion of water immediately before examina-\ntion, to fill stomach and duodenum and better depict small enhancing\nlesion in the arterial phase, and functional imaging, preferentially\nsomatostatin receptor PET/CT (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT).\nThese should also be considered in cases of type I gNETs with\nmetastases on EUS or high-risk features of metastases (G2, lymphatic\nor vascular invasion, size ≥1 cm). Recently, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT has\nbeen suggested in selected cases with tumour diameter >1 cm, G2\ntumours (perhaps Ki-67 > 10 but exact cutoff not determined), or R1\nmargins after endoscopic resection.10\nPrognosis depends on type, size, grading, histological risk factors\n(e.g., lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion), completeness of\nresection and initial tumour stage.\nRecommendations\n1. Gastrin assessment is useful to differentiate between different\ntypes of gNETs. CgA is useful as tumour marker only in type III\ngNETs (3b-A).\n2. Cross-sectional radiological imaging (CT/MRI) and 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT are not required in type I gNETs, unless metastases on EUS or\nin the presence of high-risk features (G2, vessel invasion, sus-\npected T2 on EUS ) (3b–A).\n1.3\n|\nManagement strategy for type I gNETs\n1.3.1\n|\nIntroduction\nTreatment options for type I gNETs include surveillance, endoscopic\nresection, somatostatin analogues (SSA) and eventually surgery. As\nprognosis is usually quite favourable and tumour growth slow and risk\nof metastases is below 1% in tumours <10 mm, all NET <1 cm can be\nobserved without any need for intervention.11,12 The ideal schedule\nfor observational OGD is not defined and clinical practice ranges from\nevery 6 months to every 2 years. Planning the first follow-up after\n6 months and then every 12 months is the most widely used\napproach. A regular rebiopsy of lesions is not necessary unless atypi-\ncal features (e.g., ulceration, erosion, pitting) appear, suggesting inva-\nsive progression of the lesion. The management of type I gNETs is\nsummarised in Figure 1.\n1.3.2\n|\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic\nresection for type I gNETs? Is additional treatment\nrequired in cases of R1 endoscopic resection?\nEndoscopic resection should be considered for type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm and for those lesions demonstrating increased Ki-67 as\nthese features are associated with an increased risk of metastases and\nprogression.11,13 Many small type I gNETs are G1 or low G2\n(Ki-67 < 10%);14 however, a Ki-67 cutoff has not been defined to\ndetermined when excision should be performed. Endoscopic ultraso-\nnography to determine depth of local invasion and assessment of local\nlymph nodes should be performed in lesions >1 cm and in smaller\ntumours with “high” G2 grade (cutoff not established) before any\nresection. No other imaging modality is required at this stage. The re-\nsection technique of choice depends on size and position of the\nlesion, invasion depth and local experience. Endoscopic mucosal re-\nsection (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and full-\nthickness resection (FTR) are all associated with a low risk profile for\nboth bleeding and perforation. It is not clear which is the best endo-\nscopic technique to be used for achieving a complete R0 resection.15\nHowever, resection by ESD or FTR achieve higher rates of R0 resec-\ntion, but no randomised trials have compared all techniques head-to-\nhead.16,17 For R1 resection status a re-resection in a “step-up”\napproach could be recommended (e.g., ESD after EMR, FTR after\nESD), although data showing risk of local recurrence after R1\nTABLE 2\nDiagnostic criteria and prognosis of gNET subtypes.\nType\nGastric pH\nHistology of surrounding mucosa\nGastrin levels\nGrading\nPrognosis\nI\nHigh\nGastric body atrophy, ECL-cell\nhyperplasia\nHigh\nG1 (G2)\nExcellent: Risk of metastases very low.

Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm (2b-A).\n2. ESD and FTR are more effective to achieve R0 resection compared\nto EMR (2b-B).\n3. In case of incomplete resection (R1) of a NET >1 cm a step-up\napproach (EMR > ESD > FTR > surgery) is recommended (4-C).\n1.3.3\n|\nQ2 – When should somatostatin analogues\nbe used to treat type I gNETs?\nType I gNETs usually express somatostatin receptors. Thus, therapy\nwith SSA can be initiated in metastasised patients or patients not\namenable to endoscopic or surgical resection (e.g., difficult location,\nold age, comorbidities). SSA therapy is associated with a high com-\nplete response rate of 25%–100%, but relapse is frequently observed\nafter discontinuation of therapy.20 Thus, continuous therapy would be\nthe appropriate approach. Another reason for starting SSA therapy\ncould be large tumour size or the requirement of repeated endoscopic\nresection for progressive lesions, although data evaluating this\napproach are lacking. Another therapeutic approach could be direct\ninhibition of gastrin signalling in tumour cells. Indeed, the gastrin\nreceptor\ninhibitor\nnetazepide\nhas\nbeen\nevaluated\nin\na\nproof-\nof-concept phase II trial with 16 patients showing a complete\nresponse rate in 30% of patients.21 Like SSA treatment, tumour\nrelapse after discontinuation was observed in all patients. The clinical\nbenefit of netazepide needs to be evaluated in larger randomised clini-\ncal trials before any recommendation for its use can be formulated.\nRecommendations\n1. In type I gNET patients when tumour resection is indicated but\nendoscopic or surgical techniques are not possible, SSA therapy is\nappropriate (2b-A).\n1.3.4\n|\nQ3 – What is the recommended follow-up\nschedule in type I gNETs?\nAn endoscopic follow-up every 12 months is recommended after\ncomplete endoscopic resection of a type I gNET. Whether this interval\ncan be increased after prolonged periods without evidence of relapse\nor whether the interval should be shortened in case of incomplete\n(R1) resection or risk factors associated with progression (grading G2,\nsize >20 mm) should be carefully discussed with the patient. In gen-\neral, no cross-sectional imaging is required for follow-up. In addition,\nrepeated evaluation of biomarkers CgA and gastrin should not be per-\nformed as these markers are elevated due to the underlying CAG and\nare not an indicator of relapse or progression. Follow-up OGD is\nrecommended in a type I gNET that does not require resection,\nalthough the optimal interval for planning endoscopy is not estab-\nlished\n(1–2 years\ncan\nbe\nconsidered,\nfollowing\nfirst\nfollow-up\n6–12 months after initial diagnosis). Apart from risk of tumour pro-\ngression or relapse after resection in NET lesions, patients with CAG\nFIGURE 1\nManagement of type I gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n4 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Although\nonly one international guideline recommends a regular endoscopic\nfollow-up for patients with CAG, the yearly rate of adenocarcinoma\ndetection is up to 1% in patients with type I gNETs.14 Whether this\nreflects an increased risk of adenocarcinoma development in patients\nwith a previous diagnosis of gNET is not clear. For CAG patients with-\nout a gNET, intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection have been\nlinked to an increased risk of adenocarcinoma progression. Given the\nhigh risk of adenocarcinoma detection upon follow-up of gNETs, this\nsupports the recommendation to perform an endoscopic follow-up\nevery 12–24 months in patients with previously diagnosed gNETs\n(specific timing may be proposed according to tumour size and histo-\nlogical features), whereas a 3-year interval is recommended in CAG\npatients without gNETs.22\nRecommendations\n1. An endoscopic follow-up by OGD is recommended 12 months\nafter complete endoscopic resection of type I gNET (2b-B).\n2. In\nthose\nnot\nrequiring\nresection\nfirst\nfollow-up\nshould\nbe\n12 months and then consider annual to every 1–2 years (2b-B).\n3. In patients with type I gNET, endoscopic follow-up by OGD is\nrecommended also given the risk of developing gastric adenocarci-\nnoma related to CAG (2b-A).\n1.3.5\n|\nQ4 – When is surgery recommended for\ntype I gNETs?\nAlthough type I gNETs are usually treated by an endoscopic approach,\nupfront surgical resection is recommended in all tumours that are\ngreater than 20 mm in size or with suspected muscolaris propria inva-\nsion (either on axial imaging or EUS). In addition, surgery could be\nconsidered in tumours showing high risk features on biopsy (e.g., high\ngrade 2 NET [cutoff not established], lymphovascular invasion). A lim-\nited resection with sampling of local lymph nodes is the preferred\napproach. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy should be\ndiscussed in patients with known lymph node metastases or might be\nproposed as a completion procedure after final histology has proven\nlymphatic spread, although there are no solid data supporting this\noption.\nEndoscopic resection should not be attempted in the presence of\ninvasion into the muscularis propria, suspected lymph node metasta-\nses or high-risk features of metastatic spread (e.g., high Ki-67, vascular\ninvasion, size >20 mm). These patients should receive full staging\nincluding cross-sectional imaging as described previously and 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT and upfront surgical management. The optimal cutoff\nvalue for Ki-67 is not determined, but Ki-67 values above 10% should\ntrigger evaluation of surgical treatment. In the rare instance of a G3\ntype I gNET a primarily surgical approach is recommended due to high\nrisk of metastases.23 Regarding tumour size, no clear cutoff for surgi-\ncal management can be defined. Only limited data exist on tumour\nsize and risk of metastases in the subgroup of type I gNETs. Data from\nthe SEER database and from a large series from Taiwan showed that a\ncutoff of 20 mm was associated with an increased risk of lymph node\nmetastases.13,24\nIn case of incomplete endoscopic resection (R1) or risk features in\nfinal pathology after endoscopic resection, a surgical approach should\nbe discussed with the patient to achieve R0 resection and/or re-\nsection of local lymph nodes to exclude metastatic spread. In cases of\nlesions not amenable to an endoscopic approach (e.g., location close\nto cardia) a primary surgical resection might be necessary.\nSSA treatment to reduce gastrin production, thus diminishing the\nstimulus for further tumour growth and progression, could be pro-\nposed in patients who could not undergo resection or for multiple\nlarger tumours or frequent relapse. Antrectomy should no longer be\nroutinely offered but might be an option in patients not tolerating\nSSA or declining continuous application.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgical approach is recommended in tumours >20 mm or with\nsuspected muscolaris propria invasion (either on axial imaging or\nEUS). In addition, surgery could be considered (in tumours show-\ning high risk features on biopsies (high Ki-67, lymphovascular inva-\nsion) (2b-A).\n2. Limited resection with local nodal sampling is the preferred surgical\nstrategy (3b-A).\n3. Gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy (specific kind of re-\nsection according with the tumour site) should be discussed in\npatients with known lymph node metastases or might be proposed\nas a completion procedure after final histology has proven lym-\nphatic spread after full exploration with cross sectional imaging\n(3b-A).\n1.4\n|\nType II gNETs\nType II gNETs are the rarest type of gNET (5% of cases). They arise in\nthe context of hypergastrinaemia associated with ZES which may\noccur in patients with MEN-I. Treatment of patients with type II\ngNETs\nstrictly\ndepends\non\nthe\nmanagement\nof\nthe\nMEN-I\nsyndrome.25\n1.5\n|\nManagement strategy for type III gNETS\n1.5.1\n|\nBackground\nType III gNETs have been traditionally regarded as highly aggressive\ntumours requiring extended surgical resections (i.e., partial or total\ngastrectomy) with lymphadenectomy. However, with the widespread\nuse of high-definition endoscopy, type III gNETs of smaller size and\nlower grade are increasingly being detected. A recent systematic\nreview of 147 type III gNENs in which tumour management was\nreported found that \u000145% were G1, 35% were G2 and 20% were\nG3.26 As a result, less invasive treatment options, ranging from endo-\nscopic resection to surgical wedge resection, have been investigated\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n5 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nin highly selected patients. The management of type III gNETs is sum-\nmarised in Figure 2.\n1.5.2\n|\nQ5 – Can endoscopic treatments be\nproposed to treat type III gNETs?\nType III gNETs should be carefully characterised using endoscopy,\nbiopsy, cross sectional thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI, and often\nfunctional imaging (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT or FDG/PET-CT depending on\ntumour grade) and in most cases EUS. Evidence from several retro-\nspective\ncase\nseries\nsuggests\nthat\ncarefully\nselected\npatients\nwho have no evidence of lymph node involvement can be safely and\nsuccessfully\nmanaged\nby\nendoscopic\nresection.\nEndoscopic\nre-\nsection appears to be most appropriate in patients who have localised\nG1 tumours ≤10 mm in diameter, because tumours greater than this\nsize are more likely to have lymph node metastases (even though\nthese may not be detected by imaging techniques).26,27 However\nendoscopic resection can also be considered in patients with slightly\nlarger tumours (<15 mm) and low G2 (Ki-67 3–10%) histology, partic-\nularly if the risks of surgical resection are considered to be high.26\nCurrent evidence does not support the use of a particular endoscopic\nresection technique (EMR vs. ESD).26 Some very small (<5 mm)\ntumours have also been unintentionally removed by avulsion biopsy\nwith no evidence of subsequent tumour recurrence, but this approach\nis\nnot\ngenerally\nrecommended.26\nPatients\nwith\npositive\nre-\nsection margins (R1) should be considered for additional endoscopic\nresection or surgical salvage if appropriate. Patients who have under-\ngone endoscopic resection should have close follow up with endos-\ncopy and imaging (thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI) to detect local\nand distant tumour recurrence.\nRecommendations\n1. Endoscopic resection may be considered in patients who have\nlocalised type III G1 gNETs ≤10 mm, and occasionally larger\ntumours with Ki-67 <10% and <15 mm in diameter if the risks of\nsurgical\nresection\nare\nhigh\nprovided\nadequate\nstaging\nis\nallowed (3a–C).\n1.5.3\n|\nQ6 – When should limited or extended\nsurgical treatments be proposed to treat type III\ngNETs?\nSeveral clinicopathological features should be carefully evaluated to\nidentify the best surgical option (limited vs. extended resection) for\npatients with type III gNETs.\nA limited gastric wedge resection without standard lymphade-\nnectomy can be considered as treatment option in patients with loca-\nlised, G1 type III gNETs with no evidence of lymph node involvement\non preoperative imaging (including EUS).26 In patients fulfilling the\nabove-mentioned criteria, tumour size, depth of infiltration and pres-\nence of lymphovascular invasion should be further assessed to define\nthe extent of surgical resection. Therefore, a wedge resection can be\nsafely proposed to patients with G1 type III gNETs <20 mm, limited to\nthe submucosal layer and with no evidence of lymphovascular inva-\nsion.26,28 The role of wedge resections in patients with G2 type III gNETs\nremains debated, as tumour grade represents a powerful predictor of dis-\nease aggressiveness. Similarly, the tumour size cutoff for proposing lim-\nited surgical resection is not clearly defined. Type III gNETs <10 mm are\nusually managed with endoscopic resection, whereas a limited surgical re-\nsection might be considered as initial treatment option for lesions measur-\ning >10 mm and <20 mm.26 Recent experiences report favourable\nFIGURE 2\nManagement of type III gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n6 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Radical surgery is recommended as second-line treatment\nwhen final histology reveals one or more of the following findings: pres-\nence of nodal metastases, higher tumour grade compared with original\nbiopsy, lymphovascular invasion or lack of complete tumour clearance\n(R1), in patients initially managed with a limited wedge resection.26\nRecommendations\n1. A limited wedge resection with local nodal sampling (without standard\nlymphadenectomy) can be considered as a treatment option in patients\nwith localised, G1–G2 type III gNETs, with no evidence of lymphade-\nnopathy on full staging preoperative imaging (including EUS) (2b-B).\n2. Radical surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is recommended in\ntype III gNETs when nodal metastases are found/suspected on preop-\nerative staging, if Ki67 >20% or tumour diameter >20 mm (2b-B).\n1.5.4\n|\nQ7 – What scheduled follow-up is\nrecommended after endoscopic/surgical resection of\ntype III gNETs?\nFollow-up of patients who underwent surgical resection of type III\ngNETs is based on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging (thora-\ncoabdominal CT/liver-MRI with sometimes OGD and/or EUS or func-\ntional imaging [68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and/or FDG-PET/CT depending on\nthe tumour grade]). The timing of follow-up has never been clearly\ndefined. When a total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is per-\nformed, the follow-up schedule adopted for gastric adenocarcinoma\nshould be applied.26 On the other hand, patients managed conserva-\ntively (endoscopic or surgical local excision) should undergo OGD\nafter about 3 months to check the resection site and if this shows no\nmacroscopic residual tumour, they should have regular follow-up with\ncross-sectional imaging and endoscopy/EUS. The frequency and\nchoice of test will be influenced by the final tumour size and grade as\nwell as patient fitness and in most cases, it will be possible to reduce\nthe frequency of follow up as time progresses after resection. 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT (or FDG-PET/CT depending on the tumour grade) and\nbiopsies should be performed in the presence of a suspected disease\nrelapse, but they are not routinely part of the follow-up programme.30\nRecommendations\n1. Radiological follow-up by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recom-\nmended in patients treated by surgical resection for type III gNETs (5-A).\n2\n|\nDUODENAL NEUROENDOCRINE\nTUMOURS\n2.1\n|\nIntroduction – general background\nLike gNETs, duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs) are rare\ntumours but also with an increasing incidence found mostly at OGD\nor axial imaging for other reasons (incidental discovery) but also can\nbe found as primaries at workup for patients with stage 4 diseases or\nmore rarely as part of inherited syndromes such as MEN-I and neuro-\nfibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Most dNETs are non-functional tumours,\nbut duodenal tumours secreting gastrin are not infrequent (either spo-\nradic or as part of MEN-I) and more rarely tumours secreting somato-\nstatin (so called somatostatinomas) (see Guidance paper on functional\npancreatic NETs).\nThe overall incidence of dNETs is low accounting for only 2.8% of\nall NETs.31,32 The annual age adjusted incidence for dNET has been\nreported to be 0.19 per 100,000.32 Traditionally, dNETs have been\nclassified into non-functioning (approximately 90% of lesions) or func-\ntioning tumours (those secreting specific peptides of hormones elicit-\ning a functional clinical consequence or syndrome)33 and can be\nsummarised as:\n1. Non-functioning dNETs (they can secrete peptides and substances\nnot resulting in a clinical condition or syndrome).\n2. Duodenal composite gangliocytoma/neuroma and neuroendocrine\ntumour (CogNET) (previously known as gangliocytic paragan-\nglioma), occurs almost exclusively in the second part of the duode-\nnum and periampullary region and is considered a composite\ntumour of epithelial NETs and ganglioneuroma.34\n3. Duodenal gastrinoma (gastrin secreting and either sporadic or part\nof MEN-I where duodenal localisation is very frequent) and soma-\ntostatinomas (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance\npaper on functioning pancreatic NETs).\n4. Duodenal NEC (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance\npaper for digestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).\n2.2\n|\nAssessment of dNETs\n2.2.1\n|\nPathology\nPathological assessment and grading of dNETs is like that of NETs of\nall other sites. Adequate sampling is needed and the deep mucosal\nlocation of these lesions, usually suspected by the endoscopist due to\nthe smooth surface as opposed to the more common adenomas and\ncarcinomas of the duodenum, warrants an attempt to perform deep\nbiopsies. Morphologically, the main differential diagnosis in the duo-\ndenum is the CoGNET, previously classified as a ganglioneuroma or\nparaganglioma, but now shown to be more similar to NETs.36,37\nIn cases with a high proliferation rate (i.e., mitotic count >20 in\n2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20%), NEC and adenocarcinoma with\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n7 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nneuroendocrine features should be ruled out (see guidance paper for\ndigestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).\n2.2.2\n|\nEndoscopy\nMost dNETs are in the first or second part of the duodenum.38 Symp-\ntoms range from mostly none at incidental discovery to symptoms\nattributed to gastric outlet obstruction (in rare cases of large lesions)\nor anaemia. Patients with dNETs close to the ampulla and CoGNET\nwhich occur in the periampullary region can present with gastrointes-\ntinal bleeding, abdominal pain, anaemia or jaundice.38,39 Periampullary\ndNETs are not infrequent in patients with neurofibromatosis type\n1 (NF1), also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease including\nsomatostatinomas.40,41\nAt OGD, dNETs have similar features to gNETs but are typically\nsingle small sessile, erythematous or pale lesions in the duodenal cap,\nbulb or D1 to D2.6 In recent years, increasingly smaller lesions have\nbeen detected, owing to the better mucosal visualisation with modern\nendoscopic tools. The reported mean size of dNETs varies between\n7 mm and 1.5 cm.42 Up to 10% of dNETs can occur as multiple\ntumours, which should prompt a diagnosis of MEN-I. It has been\nreported that approximately a quarter to a third of patients with\ndNETs and ZES, have undiagnosed MEN-I.43,44\nEndoscopic characterisation of dNETs has been described by Bor-\nbath and colleagues.6 Diagnosis is usually confirmed at endoscopic\nforceps biopsy (care as very small lesions may be almost completely\nexcised at biopsy sampling and making future identification hard in\ncase of R1 resection). Tumours of 1 cm or above should have accurate\nlocal staging by EUS as regional lymph node metastases occur in up to\n40%–60% of cases, especially in duodenal gastrinomas.43,45,46\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of dNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate proliferative activ-\nity of the tumour (Ki-67 and/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\n2. Endoscopic assessment of dNETs should include tumour location\nto identify periampullary tumours (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n2.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nDuodenal NETs are generally diagnosed by endoscopy and endoscopic\nultrasound. Computed tomography after ingestion of water to fill stom-\nach and duodenum, is recommended to help preoperative exploration.\nCT-enterography, MRI, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and 18F-DOPA-PET/CT are\nnot sufficiently accurate for localisation of well-differentiated gastrodu-\nodenal primary tumours,47–49 but these examinations are used to help\nstaging of regional and distant metastases.50\nLaboratory tests are required for patients newly diagnosed with\ndNET. It is especially important to recognise potential gastrinoma\n(serum gastrin, chromogranin and occasionally secretin testing). Other\nlaboratory tests, if symptoms are suggestive, may include somato-\nstatin, and very rarely growth hormone releasing factor and cortisol\nwith urinary 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid.38 If a diagnosis of genetic syn-\ndrome is suspected (e.g., MEN-I or NF1) specific laboratory tests and\ngermline testing is advised38,51 Distinguishing between dNET and\nneurofibromas may be difficult in some cases especially on axial\nimaging.\nRecommendations\n1. Locoregional and distant staging examiner actions for dNETs\ninclude contrast-enhanced CT (with water ingestion), liver -MRI\nand 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT (3b-B).\n2. Ruling out gastrinoma and screening for genetic syndromes when\nappropriate should be considered for dNETs (3b-B).\n2.3\n|\nManagement strategy for dNETs\nFactors that need to be considered prior to endoscopic resection of\ndNET are:\n1. Size of tumour (commonly estimated at EUS and OGD).\n2. Depth of invasion in relation to the deep muscle layer (estimated\nat EUS).\n3. Any evidence of lymphadenopathy and/or metastatic spread on\nEUS, liver-MRI, thoracoabdominal CT and functional imaging, pref-\nerably 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4. Grade and morphology of tumour (determined by endoscopy, EUS\nand endoscopic biopsy).\n5. Endoscopic\nappearance:\ncentral\ndepression/ulceration\nimplies\ninvasion.\n6. Suitability for endoscopic resection: size of lesion/endoscopic\naccess/location of lesion/proximity to ampulla.\n7. Hormone secretion status.\n8. Patient age and performance status.\nSize of the lesion is not a definitive guide to the correct treat-\nment. Treatment options are: endoscopic surveillance, endoscopic re-\nsection (by EMR/ESD/underwater EMR/over the scope clip), local\nduodenal resection (LR) or pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). The out-\ncomes may be related to the factors of the tumour at presentation\nrather than the type of resection procedure.52 The management of\ndNETs is summarised in Figure 3.\nWhen defining surgical indications for dNET, several key points\nshould be considered (see section 8.3).\n2.3.1\n|\nQ8 – When is endoscopic\nresection indicated?\nVery small non-functioning lesions 5 mm or less in D1 are commonly\nremoved after lifting injection and snare (or by diagnostic biopsy)\nbefore any histological diagnosis is made and these lesions do not\nusually recur or metastasise.\n8 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nFor younger and fitter patients who have lesions of 5–10 mm\n(and up to 15 mm in some centres), an opinion should be sought\nfrom therapeutic endoscopy about resection and the associated\nrisks. EUS should be performed as well as axial and functional imag-\ning. Most of these lesions are grade 1 and not invading the muscle\nlayer.\nIn\nthese\ncircumstances\nan\nendoscopic\nresection\nusing\nEMR/Cap EMR/ESD is reasonable, but risks of perforation are signif-\nicant, especially in D2. If endoscopic therapy is high risk (published\nrates of perforation 15%–25%) or unlikely to be curative, LR\n(i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision or enucleation) or pancrea-\ntoduodenectomy (PD) (if considered essential by the surgeon) should\nbe considered. Endoscopic therapy combined with laparoscopy for\nrescue in the event of perforation has been performed which may\nrepresent a novel and valuable alternative to ESD, able to guarantee\na\nhigh\nR0\nrate\nand\na\nlow\nrisk\nof\nintraoperative\nduodenal\nperforation.53\nDuodenal NETs can be multiple, particularly if they are gas-\ntrinomas, and an association with MEN-I exists. Somatostatino-\nmas\ncan\nalso\noccur\nin\nthe\nduodenum,\noften\nclose\nto\nthe\nampulla, but generally are without a clinical syndrome. There is\nan\nassociation\nwith\nNF1\n(functioning\ntumours\nare\nbeing\naddressed in a separate guidance paper on pancreatic func-\ntional NETs).\nRecommendations\n1. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 should be removed\nusing EMR type techniques (3b-C).\n2. Lesions of 5–10 mm (and up to 15 mm in some centres) can be\nremoved endoscopically after imaging work-up, but risks are rela-\ntively high (3b-C).\n2.3.2\n|\nQ9 – Can a “watch and wait” strategy be\nproposed in dNETs?\nA watch and wait policy could be considered for very small (<5 mm)\ndNETs that cannot easily be resected, are non-functional, G1 and not\ninvading the muscularis propria. This policy has usually been applied in\npatients unfit for endoscopic resection or surgery, since a more defini-\ntive therapy would be recommended in most cases, although a watch\nand wait policy has more recently been recommended as a result from\nsome small series with limited follow-up. It is not clear if watch and\nwait is a suitable option in a patient who is fit for resection.54,55\nRecommendations\nThere is very limited evidence for a watch and wait policy and generally\nthis is applied to those unfit for surgery or endoscopic resection (3b-C).\n2.3.3\n|\nQ10 – When is surgery indicated?\nData on nodal risk in very small non-functioning dNETs are scarce.\nSome series report nodal metastases as a common finding in patients\nwith dNET (40%–60%), with tumour size being the most relevant risk\nFIGURE 3\nManagement of duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs).\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n9 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Tumour location\nmay be another important feature to be considered when defining sur-\ngical indication. Lesions arising in the ampullary/periampullary area dif-\nfer from other dNETs due to a more aggressive biological behaviour in\nsome studies57 but not in others.56 Functioning neoplasms harbour a\nhigher metastatic potential.58 Tumour invasion beyond the submucosa,\ntumour grade G2–G3 and lymphovascular invasion are factors affecting\nthe risk of nodal metastases.\nDespite very low grade evidence surgical resection may be indi-\ncated in patients with dNETs showing any of the following features:\n1. Tumour size >10 mm; (some centres may advocate endoscopic\nremoval in 10–15 mm).\n2. Tumour extending beyond the submucosa.\n3. Tumour grade G2–G3.\n4. Lymphovascular invasion.\n5. Functioning neoplasms.\nRegarding the extent of resection, PD (pancreatoduodenectomy)\nand LR (local resection) represent the two main alternatives:\nIn general, pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy is the\nprocedure of choice for ampullary/periampullary neoplasms, due to\ntheir particular aggressiveness. When nodal metastases are pre- or\nintraoperatively identified, PD with nodal dissection is indicated in order\nto obtain a proper oncological clearance. However, for lesions <20 mm,\nless aggressive approaches (i.e., local excision with lymphadenectomy or\npancreas-sparing total duodenectomy) may be considered options. At\nleast eight lymph nodes should be harvested to stage patients accu-\nrately.59 However, radical surgery is associated with a high rate of\nshort- and long-term complications. Therefore, when feasible from an\noncological perspective, other surgical strategies should be considered.\nLocal duodenal resection (i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision\nor enucleation) represents a valuable and safe option, especially for\npatients with non-ampullary, non-functioning, dNET and without sus-\npected nodal involvement at staging,52 (where endoscopic resection is\nnot possible). The role of nodal dissection in this setting is unclear as\nrecent experience does not support the clearance of occult nodal\nmetastases due to lack of association with survival advantages.60\nRecommendations. 1. Surgery is recommended in cases of size >10–\n15 mm and/or tumour extending beyond the\nsubmucosa and/or grade G2-G3 and/or lym-\nphovascular invasion (3-B).\n3\n|\nMANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR\nGASTRIC AND DUODENAL G2–G3\nMETASTATIC NETS\n3.1\n|\nTreatment with curative intent\nDue to the lack of effective systemic therapeutic options surgery\nshould be evaluated even in the presence of metastatic condition\ndepending on the tumour spread and tumour biology if a complete\ntumour resection seems to be possible (R0-resection).\nGastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy includes the removal of\nlocoregional lymph nodes, so the presence of locoregional lymph\nnode metastases should not preclude surgery as a treatment option.\nIn dNET a transduodenal tumour excision with lymph node sampling\nor pancreatoduodenectomy are the treatments of choice.30 The com-\nplete resection of single or multiple liver metastases might be benefi-\ncial even for G3 tumours.61 Thus, surgical resection should be\nevaluated in G2 and in very selected cases of G3-NET depending on\nthe general health condition of the patient. Single or multiple metas-\ntases in other locations should be evaluated for a complete\nresection.\n3.2\n|\nWidespread metastatic disease\nIn the presence of metastases, a systemic therapeutic approach is\nsimilar to that recommended for advanced/unresectable NET from\nother primary sites, owing to the lack of available data in homoge-\nneous series of gastric or duodenal NETs. Somatostatin analogues\nare indicated for NETs G1–G2 with low Ki67 (<10%), and positive\nsomatostatin receptors but can be administered in tumours with\nhigher Ki-67 if slow tumour growth or slow progression are seen.\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid option\ndepending on the receptor status of the tumour. Molecular-\ntargeted therapy with everolimus is a therapeutic option, but with\nlimited\nevidence.62\nIn\nNET\nG3\nchemotherapy\nshould\nbe\nadministered.63\n3.3\n|\nPalliative primary tumour resection\nIn cases of unresectable distant metastases a palliative primary\ntumour resection can be considered rarely to avoid local complica-\ntions. The kind and extent of surgery has to be evaluated depending\non the location of the tumour and possibility of complications of sur-\ngery. A gastrectomy can be necessary in rare cases but a wedge resec-\ntion, distal or subtotal gastric resection should be preferred to reduce\nperioperative\nmorbidity.\nA\ngastric\nbypass\nwithout\ntumour\nre-\nsection should be favoured in case of bulky disease with infiltration of\nthe visceral arteries or pancreas.\n3.4\n|\nLocal recurrence\nIn the presence of local recurrence without diffuse metastatic spread,\noperative resection should be favoured to avoid bleeding or intestinal\nobstruction and to maintain quality of life. Even in the presence of dis-\ntant metastatic spread palliative surgery should be considered to\nensure quality of life depending on the tumour biology and the gen-\neral health status of the patient. Endoscopic procedures such as stent\nor jejunal catheterisation are alternatives for patients with a poor gen-\neral health status.\n10 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\n3.5\n|\nFollow-up\nThe interval for follow-up by contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT\nand/or liver-MRI, 3–12 months, should be based on the malignant\npotential of the tumour.64 Follow-up by additional 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT\nis helpful when the patient's clinical status and the results of CT or\nMRI and biochemistry are discordant. The sensitivity of 68Ga-SSA-\nPET-CT is superior to contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT for\ncharacterisation and detection of lymph node metastases and for visu-\nalisation of metastases to bone and liver,65 and therefore provides\nearlier detection of new lesions. FDG-PET/CT is instead used in G3\ntumours and can also be helpful in high G2 NET when 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT is negative. Re-evaluation of untreated patients should be per-\nformed at 3–6 month intervals.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgery with curative intention of metastatic gastroduodenal NET\nG1/G2/G3 should be performed, if a complete tumour (including\nmetastases) resection seems feasible (4-B).\n2. Palliative surgery (primary resection, bypass) may be indicated in\nmetastatic disease to maintain quality of life (4-C).\n3. The choice of systemic therapy for metastatic gastroduodenal NET\ndepends on tumour grading and includes biotherapy, everolimus,\nPRRT and chemotherapy (4-B).\n4\n|\nCONCLUSIONS\n4.1\n|\nGastric NETs\n1. Evaluation of the type of gNETs by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa is needed.\n2. Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm, whereas a surgical approach should be proposed in\ntumours larger than 2 cm. Tumours between 1 cm and 2 cm in size\nare usually managed by endoscopic resection after EUS evaluation,\nalthough surgery might be indicated in selected cases with G2\ntumours and high Ki-67 (cutoff not established), and in G3\ntumours.\n3. In type III gNETs, a surgical approach is recommended. However,\nin selected patients with small (<1 cm) G1 tumours, endoscopic re-\nsection may be appropriate.\n4.2\n|\nDuodenal NETs\n1. Endoscopic assessment should include tumour location to identify\nperiampullary tumours. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm.\n2. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 may be removed using\nEMR type techniques, whereas larger tumours (>1 cm) and/or\ntumour extending beyond the submucosa and/or grades G2–G3\nand/or lymphovascular invasion and/or functioning neoplasms\nshould be managed by a surgical approach after complete disease\nstaging by dedicated CT, liver-MRI+/\u0003 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4.3\n|\nUnmet needs\n1. The prognostic role of Ki67 in type I gNETs is unclear.\n2. Long-term outcomes of endoscopic resection for both selected\ngastric type 3 NETs, and also duodenal NETs, are lacking.\n3. The risk of progression in low-grade gastroduodenal NETs after\nincomplete R1 endoscopic resection is unknown.\n4. The role of somatostatin analogue treatments in managing type I\ngNETs has not yet been established.\n5. More data are required regarding natural history PPI-induced\ngNETs.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nFrancesco Panzuto: Conceptualization; methodology; supervision;\nwriting – original draft; writing – review and editing.

Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may\nsecrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF\nto functional status.10\nRecommendation\n\u0002 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,\ngrading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and\nsynaptophysin should be reported. SSTR staining or spe-\nciﬁc staining for peptide hormones and amines as well as\nuse of molecular markers is optional and dependent on\nclinical requirements [III, A].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nDisease stage and tumour grade are the two major indepen-\ndent prognostic parameters and should always be assessed\n[III, A]. Since the WHO 2010 classiﬁcation, NENs are graded\nTable 1.

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs. FDG is the tracer of choice\nfor G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose\nmetabolism and less SSTR expression than the low-grade\nNETs, for which the situation is usually the reverse.29 Com-\nbined SSTR imaging and FDG-PET-CT has been shown to be\ncomplementary for lesion detection. Findings of FDG-\npositive NETs at PET-CT indicate worse prognosis.29e31\nThe author panel believes that optimal diagnostic and\nprognostic information can be achieved by submitting all\nNET G2/G3 patients to PET-CT with both FDG and 68Ga-\nTable 3.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic\nradical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph\nnodes can be achieved in \u000480% of cases if carried out by\nexperienced surgeons.40\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locore-\ngional\ndisease\nin\nNET\nG1\nand\nG2.\nBefore\nany\nFigure 2.

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C]. Combining resection and radio-\nfrequency ablation (RFA) may provide the opportunity to\nachieve complete tumour removal, allowing more limited\nM.

However, in aggressive NENs (NEC\nG3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy\n(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are\nwarranted.\nMedical therapy\nThe goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-\nassociated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].\nTreatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-\ntide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning\nNETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved\nin 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations\n[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also\nnamed biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in\nNETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the\nmultiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been\nintroduced more recently in the management of NETs.

SSAs are an established anti-\nproliferative therapy in metastatic GEP-NETs, based on two\nplacebo-controlled trials. Most frequently, they are used in\nﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the\nsettings in which they have been studied. Overall response\nrates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset. The\nmedian progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached\nwith lanreotide (>27 months) and was 18 months in the\nplacebo arm.59 The CLARINET extension study also showed\nefﬁcacy in\nprogressive\ndisease\npatients with\nentero-\npancreatic NETs.60 There is very good long-term tolerability\nof both SSAs.47,58,59 SSAs can be recommended for tumour\ngrowth control in advanced SSTR-positive, slowly-growing\nGI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I, A; European Society\nfor Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A; ESMO-\nMCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48]. There was a beneﬁt in terms of PFS prolon-\ngation in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56 (0.37e0.8)] and the\nlung NET subgroup [HR 0.5 (0.28e0.88)], and everolimus is\nEMA-approved for NF-GI and lung NETs. Everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive GI NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%).

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.\nThe stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.\nA watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

In\npatients with a Ki-67 of >35%, mPFS was 6.8 months in one\nstudy,101 and in patient subgroups with Ki-67 >55%, mPFS\nwas 6 months, 4 months and 4 months, respectively from\nthe different studies.99,100,102 PRRT may be considered in\npatients with NET G3 [IV, C], however, patients need to be\ncarefully selected and prospective trials are warranted to\nfurther establish which patients with NEN G3 might beneﬁt\nmost from PRRT. The NETTER-2 trial has recently been\ninitiated to address this issue (NCT03972488).\nTreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE is in general considered\nsafe, however, up to 3%e4% of the patients may develop\nirreversible bone marrow toxicity such as leukaemia or bone\nmarrow dysplasia. Mild renal toxicity grade 1/2 has been re-\nported long term in 30% of the patients (see Section 5 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline).\nFor more information about PRRT and SSA combination\nand maintenance therapy, see Section 6 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 A surgical approach is indicated in selected patients\naffected by stage IV GEP-NETs who show exclusive or pre-\ndominant liver disease after careful evaluation of tumour\ngrading, distribution of LMs and primary site [IV, B].\n\u0002 Upfront surgery is not indicated in the presence of extra-\nabdominal metastases and high-grade GEP-NENs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Presence of an advanced NEC G3 is considered an abso-\nlute contraindication for an upfront surgery [IV, A].\n\u0002 Palliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV,\nC]. However, it is controversial if primary tumour\nremoval in patients with stage IV disease translates to\nan improvement in survival.\n\u0002 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-\ntoms in patients affected by metastatic functioning\nSI-NETs [IV, B].\n\u0002 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms\nrelated to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery\nmay be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered\nin patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].\n\u0002 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].\n\u0002 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].\nHowever, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy\nwith platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].\n\u0002 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid\noptions for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with\nother systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.\nThe choice of the procedures depends on the local\nexpertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and\nthe localisation of liver involvement [V, C].\n\u0002 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be\napplied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve\ncontrol of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-\ntions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)\n[IV, A].\n\u0002 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,\nlocoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-\ntive to systemic treatment [IV, B].\n\u0002 Systemic therapy should be administered to control\ntumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth\n[I, A].\n\u0002 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients\nwith CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,\nglucagonoma) [I, A].\n\u0002 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-\ntristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-\nment to SSAs [I, A].\n\u0002 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve\nsymptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of\nIFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].\n\u0002 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].\n\u0002 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires\ncareful information to be given to the patient before and\ndirectly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper\ntreatment [IV, A].\n\u0002 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on\npathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth\nbehaviour and SSTR imaging.\n\u0002 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients\nwith low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable\ndisease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term\nfavourable prognosis.\n\u0002 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for\ntumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing\nSSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,\nA; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. Positive SSTR\nstatus is generally required but is not predictive of\nresponse.\n\u0002 IFN-a can be considered for antiproliferative therapy\nif other treatment options have been exploited or\nare not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative on functional\nimaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where there\nare fewer therapy options compared with Pan-NETs\n[IV, B].\n\u0002 Everolimus is EMA-approved for progressive Pan-NET G1/\nG2 with or without prior ChT, for NF-GI and lung NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In GI NETs, everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive disease [I, A].\n\u0002 The use of everolimus after PRRT is recommended in\nintestinal NETs, if PRRT is available [V, A], although the\ntreatment sequence needs to be further studied in the\nabsence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\n\u0002 The combination therapy of SSA and everolimus for an\nantiproliferative purpose is not recommended [II, D].\nM.

There is\nno established second-line therapy, but different\nregimens [e.g. 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI),\n5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin\n(FOLFOX),\nCAPTEM\n\u0006\nbevacizumab] may be considered [IV, B].\n\u0002 In NET G3, response rates to cisplatin/etoposide are\nlow, and the use of this combination is not recommen-\nded [IV, C].\n\u0002 ChT cannot be recommended in well-differentiated\nslowly growing NETs of the GI tract [II, C]; exceptions\nmay be rapidly progressive tumours or NET G2 with\nhigher Ki-67 close to NET G3 [V, C].\n\u0002 PRRT is recommended as second-line therapy in patients\nwith midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs who\nfulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT [I, A].\n\u0002 177Lu-DOTATATE is EMA- and FDA-approved for patients\nwith midgut NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] and\nPan-NETs [III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4].\n\u0002 In Pan-NETs, PRRT should be used after failure of\napproved therapies [III, A].\n\u0002 In carefully selected patients, PRRT may be considered in\nNET G3 [IV, C].\n\u0002 SSA should be combined with PRRT in patients with\nfunctioning tumours (CS) to prevent increasing symp-\ntoms such as diarrhoea and/or ﬂushing and hormonal\ncrisis soon after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 It is also common practice to continue SSA beyond PRRT\nin functioning tumours, as a full resolution of CS-related\nsymptoms is rarely achieved after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 The combination of SSA with PRRT is not recommended\nin patients with NF-NETs, [IV, C] and it remains unclear if\nSSA should be continued after PRRT as a maintenance\ntherapy.\nPERSONALISED MEDICINE\nIn the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity of\ncomparative\nrandomised\ntrials,\ntherapy\nselection\nin\nadvanced non-resectable disease is frequently based on\nindividual patient clinical and pathological features and\nSSTR imaging [IV, A]. Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence. NSE and\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be monitored in NEC;\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Conventional imaging\nincludes thoracic and abdominal scans every 2e3 months.\nFDG-PET may be required in case of suspected recurrence to\ndiscriminate lesions from unspeciﬁc ﬁndings; otherwise,\nhigh-resolution CT is the imaging method of choice, unless\nresection is considered in locally advanced NEN G3,\nwhere FDG-PET is mandatory to exclude distant metastatic\ndisease.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional\nand SSTR imaging [V, B].\n\u0002 In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1eG2, it is recom-\nmended that imaging is carried out every 3e6 months\n(CT or MRI), and in NEC G3 every 2e3 months [V, C].\nSimilar staging intervals apply to advanced disease.\n\u0002 Follow-up should be lifelong, although the staging inter-\nvals may be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up.\n\u0002 Small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix or rectum do not need any follow-up if\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in\naccordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures\nfor Clinical Practice Guidelines development, http://www.\nesmo.org/Guidelines/ESMOGuidelines-Methodology.\nThe\nrelevant literature has been selected by the expert authors.\nAn ESMO-MCBS table with ESMO-MCBS scores is included\nin supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.107 Levels of evidence and grades of recommenda-\ntion have been applied using the system shown in\nsupplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.108 Statements without grading were considered\njustiﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts and the\nESMO Faculty.

Type I gNETs are indolent,\nwith negligible risk of metastases (<5%) and excellent long-term sur-\nvival (almost 100%); the prognosis of a patient with type II gNETs\nneeds to be assessed in the context of MEN-I syndrome; however,\nthe risk of metastases may vary between 10% and 30%. Type III\ntumours are usually more aggressive, owing to the high prevalence\nof metastatic disease (>50%) and the more unfavourable long-term\nsurvival (5-year survival rate 70%), although they present well-\ndifferentiated morphology in the majority of cases. Type III gNENs\nmay also have higher grades. The key questions discussed in the pre-\nsent paper are summarised in Table 1. Data were identified by MED-\nLINE database searches and expert opinion/recommendations given\naccording to the best available evidence and the authors’ experi-\nence. Each recommendation for treatment and diagnosis will have a\nlevel of evidence and grade of recommendation as per the GRADE\nsystem (Table S1). The major features of gNETs are summarised in\nTable 2.\n1.2\n|\nAssessment of gastric neuroendocrine\ntumours\n1.2.1\n|\nPathology\nGastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs) are different from other\ngastrointestinal NETs as in the stomach a clear aetiology is emerging\nwhere gastric NETs are induced in the context of hyperplasia of\nenterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. In 1993 an aetiological framework\nfor gastric NETs was reported,2 where gastric NETs were either\nfound in a setting of ECL cell hyperplasia associated with high gas-\ntrin levels due to autoimmune fundic atrophic gastritis (type I NETs),\nhigh gastrin levels due to gastrinoma (type II NETs) or without ECL\nhyperplasia (type III NETs). More recently, general atrophy in chronic\nH. pylori associated gastritis,3 functional failure of parietal cells due\nto mutations4 or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use5 have also been\nreported to be associated with NETs, some with a background of\nECL cell hyperplasia but in cases of proton pump inhibition also\nassociated with parietal cell hyperplasia. These newly described gas-\ntric NETs are similar to the originally described type I gNETs as they\nare secondary to failed acid secretion. The secondary (type I and\ntype II) gNETs have a more indolent course2,5 and can be reversible\nif the cause can be impeded. It is therefore important to recognise\nthe associated gastric mucosal changes.6\nAdequate tumour sampling is essential for grading NETs as pre-\nscribed in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of gas-\ntrointestinal tumours of 2019.7 As NETs are usually located deep in\nthe mucosa (not at the surface) attention should be paid to this when\ntaking biopsies.\nGastric NETs are graded using the same criteria as for all gastroin-\ntestinal sites:8\nG1: mitotic count <2 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index <3% in hotspot\nof at least 500 cells.\nG2: mitotic count between 2 and 20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index\nbetween 3% and 20% in hotspot of at least 500 cells.\nG3: mitotic count >20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20% in hot-\nspot of at least 500 cells.\n1.2.2\n|\nEndoscopy\nThe primary diagnostic tool for gNETs is oesophagogastroduode-\nnoscopy (OGD). For the assessment of gastric NETs, not only rep-\nresentative biopsies of the tumour but also biopsies of the\nsurrounding mucosa and other parts of the stomach (antrum and\nbody-fundus) are essential as these give clues on the nature/\naetiology and, with this, the prognosis and treatment of the NET.\nIn addition, sampling of gastric juice for pH measurement is\nstrongly encouraged. Furthermore, virtual chromoendoscopy (nar-\nrow-band imaging, blue light imaging, i-scan) may be useful to pro-\nvide\nadditional\ninformation\nto\nidentify\nfield\nchanges\nor\nprecancerous lesions in underlying atrophic mucosa.9 In addition\nto OGD, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be performed in all\nlesions >1 cm regardless of type and in all lesions of type III\nregardless of size, unless large or metastatic lesions are found.\nReporting should include size of the lesion infiltration depth and\nassessment of local lymph nodes.\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of gNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to evaluate proliferative activity of the tumour (Ki67\nand/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\nTABLE 1\nList of questions.\nGASTRIC NET\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic resection for type I gNETs?

Evaluation of the type of gNET by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n1.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nBiomarker assessment should include fasting gastrin and chromo-\ngranin A (CgA). Whereas gastrin may be useful to differentiate\nbetween different types (elevated in type I and type II, normal in\ntype III), CgA is only useful as a tumour marker in type III gNETs.\nIn the presence of ongoing PPI therapy gastrin and CgA are not\ndiagnostic and are difficult to interpret. In general, caution should\nbe used when evaluating CgA values, considering the different\ndiagnostic accuracy of available assays. Parietal cell and intrinsic\nfactor antibodies, vitamin B12 and thyroid function parameters\nshould be measured in suspected cases of autoimmune gastritis.\nWhereas type I gNETs do not usually require additional cross-\nsectional imaging, type III gNETs should undergo cross-sectional\nimaging – liver contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nand/or contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography\n(CT), with previous ingestion of water immediately before examina-\ntion, to fill stomach and duodenum and better depict small enhancing\nlesion in the arterial phase, and functional imaging, preferentially\nsomatostatin receptor PET/CT (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT).\nThese should also be considered in cases of type I gNETs with\nmetastases on EUS or high-risk features of metastases (G2, lymphatic\nor vascular invasion, size ≥1 cm). Recently, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT has\nbeen suggested in selected cases with tumour diameter >1 cm, G2\ntumours (perhaps Ki-67 > 10 but exact cutoff not determined), or R1\nmargins after endoscopic resection.10\nPrognosis depends on type, size, grading, histological risk factors\n(e.g., lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion), completeness of\nresection and initial tumour stage.\nRecommendations\n1. Gastrin assessment is useful to differentiate between different\ntypes of gNETs. CgA is useful as tumour marker only in type III\ngNETs (3b-A).\n2. Cross-sectional radiological imaging (CT/MRI) and 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT are not required in type I gNETs, unless metastases on EUS or\nin the presence of high-risk features (G2, vessel invasion, sus-\npected T2 on EUS ) (3b–A).\n1.3\n|\nManagement strategy for type I gNETs\n1.3.1\n|\nIntroduction\nTreatment options for type I gNETs include surveillance, endoscopic\nresection, somatostatin analogues (SSA) and eventually surgery. As\nprognosis is usually quite favourable and tumour growth slow and risk\nof metastases is below 1% in tumours <10 mm, all NET <1 cm can be\nobserved without any need for intervention.11,12 The ideal schedule\nfor observational OGD is not defined and clinical practice ranges from\nevery 6 months to every 2 years. Planning the first follow-up after\n6 months and then every 12 months is the most widely used\napproach. A regular rebiopsy of lesions is not necessary unless atypi-\ncal features (e.g., ulceration, erosion, pitting) appear, suggesting inva-\nsive progression of the lesion. The management of type I gNETs is\nsummarised in Figure 1.\n1.3.2\n|\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic\nresection for type I gNETs? Is additional treatment\nrequired in cases of R1 endoscopic resection?\nEndoscopic resection should be considered for type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm and for those lesions demonstrating increased Ki-67 as\nthese features are associated with an increased risk of metastases and\nprogression.11,13 Many small type I gNETs are G1 or low G2\n(Ki-67 < 10%);14 however, a Ki-67 cutoff has not been defined to\ndetermined when excision should be performed. Endoscopic ultraso-\nnography to determine depth of local invasion and assessment of local\nlymph nodes should be performed in lesions >1 cm and in smaller\ntumours with “high” G2 grade (cutoff not established) before any\nresection. No other imaging modality is required at this stage. The re-\nsection technique of choice depends on size and position of the\nlesion, invasion depth and local experience. Endoscopic mucosal re-\nsection (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and full-\nthickness resection (FTR) are all associated with a low risk profile for\nboth bleeding and perforation. It is not clear which is the best endo-\nscopic technique to be used for achieving a complete R0 resection.15\nHowever, resection by ESD or FTR achieve higher rates of R0 resec-\ntion, but no randomised trials have compared all techniques head-to-\nhead.16,17 For R1 resection status a re-resection in a “step-up”\napproach could be recommended (e.g., ESD after EMR, FTR after\nESD), although data showing risk of local recurrence after R1\nTABLE 2\nDiagnostic criteria and prognosis of gNET subtypes.\nType\nGastric pH\nHistology of surrounding mucosa\nGastrin levels\nGrading\nPrognosis\nI\nHigh\nGastric body atrophy, ECL-cell\nhyperplasia\nHigh\nG1 (G2)\nExcellent: Risk of metastases very low.

Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm (2b-A).\n2. ESD and FTR are more effective to achieve R0 resection compared\nto EMR (2b-B).\n3. In case of incomplete resection (R1) of a NET >1 cm a step-up\napproach (EMR > ESD > FTR > surgery) is recommended (4-C).\n1.3.3\n|\nQ2 – When should somatostatin analogues\nbe used to treat type I gNETs?\nType I gNETs usually express somatostatin receptors. Thus, therapy\nwith SSA can be initiated in metastasised patients or patients not\namenable to endoscopic or surgical resection (e.g., difficult location,\nold age, comorbidities). SSA therapy is associated with a high com-\nplete response rate of 25%–100%, but relapse is frequently observed\nafter discontinuation of therapy.20 Thus, continuous therapy would be\nthe appropriate approach. Another reason for starting SSA therapy\ncould be large tumour size or the requirement of repeated endoscopic\nresection for progressive lesions, although data evaluating this\napproach are lacking. Another therapeutic approach could be direct\ninhibition of gastrin signalling in tumour cells. Indeed, the gastrin\nreceptor\ninhibitor\nnetazepide\nhas\nbeen\nevaluated\nin\na\nproof-\nof-concept phase II trial with 16 patients showing a complete\nresponse rate in 30% of patients.21 Like SSA treatment, tumour\nrelapse after discontinuation was observed in all patients. The clinical\nbenefit of netazepide needs to be evaluated in larger randomised clini-\ncal trials before any recommendation for its use can be formulated.\nRecommendations\n1. In type I gNET patients when tumour resection is indicated but\nendoscopic or surgical techniques are not possible, SSA therapy is\nappropriate (2b-A).\n1.3.4\n|\nQ3 – What is the recommended follow-up\nschedule in type I gNETs?\nAn endoscopic follow-up every 12 months is recommended after\ncomplete endoscopic resection of a type I gNET. Whether this interval\ncan be increased after prolonged periods without evidence of relapse\nor whether the interval should be shortened in case of incomplete\n(R1) resection or risk factors associated with progression (grading G2,\nsize >20 mm) should be carefully discussed with the patient. In gen-\neral, no cross-sectional imaging is required for follow-up. In addition,\nrepeated evaluation of biomarkers CgA and gastrin should not be per-\nformed as these markers are elevated due to the underlying CAG and\nare not an indicator of relapse or progression. Follow-up OGD is\nrecommended in a type I gNET that does not require resection,\nalthough the optimal interval for planning endoscopy is not estab-\nlished\n(1–2 years\ncan\nbe\nconsidered,\nfollowing\nfirst\nfollow-up\n6–12 months after initial diagnosis). Apart from risk of tumour pro-\ngression or relapse after resection in NET lesions, patients with CAG\nFIGURE 1\nManagement of type I gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n4 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Although\nonly one international guideline recommends a regular endoscopic\nfollow-up for patients with CAG, the yearly rate of adenocarcinoma\ndetection is up to 1% in patients with type I gNETs.14 Whether this\nreflects an increased risk of adenocarcinoma development in patients\nwith a previous diagnosis of gNET is not clear. For CAG patients with-\nout a gNET, intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection have been\nlinked to an increased risk of adenocarcinoma progression. Given the\nhigh risk of adenocarcinoma detection upon follow-up of gNETs, this\nsupports the recommendation to perform an endoscopic follow-up\nevery 12–24 months in patients with previously diagnosed gNETs\n(specific timing may be proposed according to tumour size and histo-\nlogical features), whereas a 3-year interval is recommended in CAG\npatients without gNETs.22\nRecommendations\n1. An endoscopic follow-up by OGD is recommended 12 months\nafter complete endoscopic resection of type I gNET (2b-B).\n2. In\nthose\nnot\nrequiring\nresection\nfirst\nfollow-up\nshould\nbe\n12 months and then consider annual to every 1–2 years (2b-B).\n3. In patients with type I gNET, endoscopic follow-up by OGD is\nrecommended also given the risk of developing gastric adenocarci-\nnoma related to CAG (2b-A).\n1.3.5\n|\nQ4 – When is surgery recommended for\ntype I gNETs?\nAlthough type I gNETs are usually treated by an endoscopic approach,\nupfront surgical resection is recommended in all tumours that are\ngreater than 20 mm in size or with suspected muscolaris propria inva-\nsion (either on axial imaging or EUS). In addition, surgery could be\nconsidered in tumours showing high risk features on biopsy (e.g., high\ngrade 2 NET [cutoff not established], lymphovascular invasion). A lim-\nited resection with sampling of local lymph nodes is the preferred\napproach. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy should be\ndiscussed in patients with known lymph node metastases or might be\nproposed as a completion procedure after final histology has proven\nlymphatic spread, although there are no solid data supporting this\noption.\nEndoscopic resection should not be attempted in the presence of\ninvasion into the muscularis propria, suspected lymph node metasta-\nses or high-risk features of metastatic spread (e.g., high Ki-67, vascular\ninvasion, size >20 mm). These patients should receive full staging\nincluding cross-sectional imaging as described previously and 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT and upfront surgical management. The optimal cutoff\nvalue for Ki-67 is not determined, but Ki-67 values above 10% should\ntrigger evaluation of surgical treatment. In the rare instance of a G3\ntype I gNET a primarily surgical approach is recommended due to high\nrisk of metastases.23 Regarding tumour size, no clear cutoff for surgi-\ncal management can be defined. Only limited data exist on tumour\nsize and risk of metastases in the subgroup of type I gNETs. Data from\nthe SEER database and from a large series from Taiwan showed that a\ncutoff of 20 mm was associated with an increased risk of lymph node\nmetastases.13,24\nIn case of incomplete endoscopic resection (R1) or risk features in\nfinal pathology after endoscopic resection, a surgical approach should\nbe discussed with the patient to achieve R0 resection and/or re-\nsection of local lymph nodes to exclude metastatic spread. In cases of\nlesions not amenable to an endoscopic approach (e.g., location close\nto cardia) a primary surgical resection might be necessary.\nSSA treatment to reduce gastrin production, thus diminishing the\nstimulus for further tumour growth and progression, could be pro-\nposed in patients who could not undergo resection or for multiple\nlarger tumours or frequent relapse. Antrectomy should no longer be\nroutinely offered but might be an option in patients not tolerating\nSSA or declining continuous application.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgical approach is recommended in tumours >20 mm or with\nsuspected muscolaris propria invasion (either on axial imaging or\nEUS). In addition, surgery could be considered (in tumours show-\ning high risk features on biopsies (high Ki-67, lymphovascular inva-\nsion) (2b-A).\n2. Limited resection with local nodal sampling is the preferred surgical\nstrategy (3b-A).\n3. Gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy (specific kind of re-\nsection according with the tumour site) should be discussed in\npatients with known lymph node metastases or might be proposed\nas a completion procedure after final histology has proven lym-\nphatic spread after full exploration with cross sectional imaging\n(3b-A).\n1.4\n|\nType II gNETs\nType II gNETs are the rarest type of gNET (5% of cases). They arise in\nthe context of hypergastrinaemia associated with ZES which may\noccur in patients with MEN-I. Treatment of patients with type II\ngNETs\nstrictly\ndepends\non\nthe\nmanagement\nof\nthe\nMEN-I\nsyndrome.25\n1.5\n|\nManagement strategy for type III gNETS\n1.5.1\n|\nBackground\nType III gNETs have been traditionally regarded as highly aggressive\ntumours requiring extended surgical resections (i.e., partial or total\ngastrectomy) with lymphadenectomy. However, with the widespread\nuse of high-definition endoscopy, type III gNETs of smaller size and\nlower grade are increasingly being detected. A recent systematic\nreview of 147 type III gNENs in which tumour management was\nreported found that \u000145% were G1, 35% were G2 and 20% were\nG3.26 As a result, less invasive treatment options, ranging from endo-\nscopic resection to surgical wedge resection, have been investigated\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n5 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

The management of type III gNETs is sum-\nmarised in Figure 2.\n1.5.2\n|\nQ5 – Can endoscopic treatments be\nproposed to treat type III gNETs?\nType III gNETs should be carefully characterised using endoscopy,\nbiopsy, cross sectional thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI, and often\nfunctional imaging (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT or FDG/PET-CT depending on\ntumour grade) and in most cases EUS. Evidence from several retro-\nspective\ncase\nseries\nsuggests\nthat\ncarefully\nselected\npatients\nwho have no evidence of lymph node involvement can be safely and\nsuccessfully\nmanaged\nby\nendoscopic\nresection.\nEndoscopic\nre-\nsection appears to be most appropriate in patients who have localised\nG1 tumours ≤10 mm in diameter, because tumours greater than this\nsize are more likely to have lymph node metastases (even though\nthese may not be detected by imaging techniques).26,27 However\nendoscopic resection can also be considered in patients with slightly\nlarger tumours (<15 mm) and low G2 (Ki-67 3–10%) histology, partic-\nularly if the risks of surgical resection are considered to be high.26\nCurrent evidence does not support the use of a particular endoscopic\nresection technique (EMR vs. ESD).26 Some very small (<5 mm)\ntumours have also been unintentionally removed by avulsion biopsy\nwith no evidence of subsequent tumour recurrence, but this approach\nis\nnot\ngenerally\nrecommended.26\nPatients\nwith\npositive\nre-\nsection margins (R1) should be considered for additional endoscopic\nresection or surgical salvage if appropriate. Patients who have under-\ngone endoscopic resection should have close follow up with endos-\ncopy and imaging (thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI) to detect local\nand distant tumour recurrence.\nRecommendations\n1. Endoscopic resection may be considered in patients who have\nlocalised type III G1 gNETs ≤10 mm, and occasionally larger\ntumours with Ki-67 <10% and <15 mm in diameter if the risks of\nsurgical\nresection\nare\nhigh\nprovided\nadequate\nstaging\nis\nallowed (3a–C).\n1.5.3\n|\nQ6 – When should limited or extended\nsurgical treatments be proposed to treat type III\ngNETs?\nSeveral clinicopathological features should be carefully evaluated to\nidentify the best surgical option (limited vs. extended resection) for\npatients with type III gNETs.\nA limited gastric wedge resection without standard lymphade-\nnectomy can be considered as treatment option in patients with loca-\nlised, G1 type III gNETs with no evidence of lymph node involvement\non preoperative imaging (including EUS).26 In patients fulfilling the\nabove-mentioned criteria, tumour size, depth of infiltration and pres-\nence of lymphovascular invasion should be further assessed to define\nthe extent of surgical resection. Therefore, a wedge resection can be\nsafely proposed to patients with G1 type III gNETs <20 mm, limited to\nthe submucosal layer and with no evidence of lymphovascular inva-\nsion.26,28 The role of wedge resections in patients with G2 type III gNETs\nremains debated, as tumour grade represents a powerful predictor of dis-\nease aggressiveness. Similarly, the tumour size cutoff for proposing lim-\nited surgical resection is not clearly defined. Type III gNETs <10 mm are\nusually managed with endoscopic resection, whereas a limited surgical re-\nsection might be considered as initial treatment option for lesions measur-\ning >10 mm and <20 mm.26 Recent experiences report favourable\nFIGURE 2\nManagement of type III gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n6 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Radical surgery is recommended as second-line treatment\nwhen final histology reveals one or more of the following findings: pres-\nence of nodal metastases, higher tumour grade compared with original\nbiopsy, lymphovascular invasion or lack of complete tumour clearance\n(R1), in patients initially managed with a limited wedge resection.26\nRecommendations\n1. A limited wedge resection with local nodal sampling (without standard\nlymphadenectomy) can be considered as a treatment option in patients\nwith localised, G1–G2 type III gNETs, with no evidence of lymphade-\nnopathy on full staging preoperative imaging (including EUS) (2b-B).\n2. Radical surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is recommended in\ntype III gNETs when nodal metastases are found/suspected on preop-\nerative staging, if Ki67 >20% or tumour diameter >20 mm (2b-B).\n1.5.4\n|\nQ7 – What scheduled follow-up is\nrecommended after endoscopic/surgical resection of\ntype III gNETs?\nFollow-up of patients who underwent surgical resection of type III\ngNETs is based on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging (thora-\ncoabdominal CT/liver-MRI with sometimes OGD and/or EUS or func-\ntional imaging [68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and/or FDG-PET/CT depending on\nthe tumour grade]). The timing of follow-up has never been clearly\ndefined. When a total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is per-\nformed, the follow-up schedule adopted for gastric adenocarcinoma\nshould be applied.26 On the other hand, patients managed conserva-\ntively (endoscopic or surgical local excision) should undergo OGD\nafter about 3 months to check the resection site and if this shows no\nmacroscopic residual tumour, they should have regular follow-up with\ncross-sectional imaging and endoscopy/EUS. The frequency and\nchoice of test will be influenced by the final tumour size and grade as\nwell as patient fitness and in most cases, it will be possible to reduce\nthe frequency of follow up as time progresses after resection. 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT (or FDG-PET/CT depending on the tumour grade) and\nbiopsies should be performed in the presence of a suspected disease\nrelapse, but they are not routinely part of the follow-up programme.30\nRecommendations\n1. Radiological follow-up by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recom-\nmended in patients treated by surgical resection for type III gNETs (5-A).\n2\n|\nDUODENAL NEUROENDOCRINE\nTUMOURS\n2.1\n|\nIntroduction – general background\nLike gNETs, duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs) are rare\ntumours but also with an increasing incidence found mostly at OGD\nor axial imaging for other reasons (incidental discovery) but also can\nbe found as primaries at workup for patients with stage 4 diseases or\nmore rarely as part of inherited syndromes such as MEN-I and neuro-\nfibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Most dNETs are non-functional tumours,\nbut duodenal tumours secreting gastrin are not infrequent (either spo-\nradic or as part of MEN-I) and more rarely tumours secreting somato-\nstatin (so called somatostatinomas) (see Guidance paper on functional\npancreatic NETs).\nThe overall incidence of dNETs is low accounting for only 2.8% of\nall NETs.31,32 The annual age adjusted incidence for dNET has been\nreported to be 0.19 per 100,000.32 Traditionally, dNETs have been\nclassified into non-functioning (approximately 90% of lesions) or func-\ntioning tumours (those secreting specific peptides of hormones elicit-\ning a functional clinical consequence or syndrome)33 and can be\nsummarised as:\n1. Non-functioning dNETs (they can secrete peptides and substances\nnot resulting in a clinical condition or syndrome).\n2. Duodenal composite gangliocytoma/neuroma and neuroendocrine\ntumour (CogNET) (previously known as gangliocytic paragan-\nglioma), occurs almost exclusively in the second part of the duode-\nnum and periampullary region and is considered a composite\ntumour of epithelial NETs and ganglioneuroma.34\n3. Duodenal gastrinoma (gastrin secreting and either sporadic or part\nof MEN-I where duodenal localisation is very frequent) and soma-\ntostatinomas (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance\npaper on functioning pancreatic NETs).\n4.

Adequate sampling is needed and the deep mucosal\nlocation of these lesions, usually suspected by the endoscopist due to\nthe smooth surface as opposed to the more common adenomas and\ncarcinomas of the duodenum, warrants an attempt to perform deep\nbiopsies. Morphologically, the main differential diagnosis in the duo-\ndenum is the CoGNET, previously classified as a ganglioneuroma or\nparaganglioma, but now shown to be more similar to NETs.36,37\nIn cases with a high proliferation rate (i.e., mitotic count >20 in\n2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20%), NEC and adenocarcinoma with\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n7 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Patients with dNETs close to the ampulla and CoGNET\nwhich occur in the periampullary region can present with gastrointes-\ntinal bleeding, abdominal pain, anaemia or jaundice.38,39 Periampullary\ndNETs are not infrequent in patients with neurofibromatosis type\n1 (NF1), also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease including\nsomatostatinomas.40,41\nAt OGD, dNETs have similar features to gNETs but are typically\nsingle small sessile, erythematous or pale lesions in the duodenal cap,\nbulb or D1 to D2.6 In recent years, increasingly smaller lesions have\nbeen detected, owing to the better mucosal visualisation with modern\nendoscopic tools. The reported mean size of dNETs varies between\n7 mm and 1.5 cm.42 Up to 10% of dNETs can occur as multiple\ntumours, which should prompt a diagnosis of MEN-I. It has been\nreported that approximately a quarter to a third of patients with\ndNETs and ZES, have undiagnosed MEN-I.43,44\nEndoscopic characterisation of dNETs has been described by Bor-\nbath and colleagues.6 Diagnosis is usually confirmed at endoscopic\nforceps biopsy (care as very small lesions may be almost completely\nexcised at biopsy sampling and making future identification hard in\ncase of R1 resection). Tumours of 1 cm or above should have accurate\nlocal staging by EUS as regional lymph node metastases occur in up to\n40%–60% of cases, especially in duodenal gastrinomas.43,45,46\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of dNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate proliferative activ-\nity of the tumour (Ki-67 and/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\n2. Endoscopic assessment of dNETs should include tumour location\nto identify periampullary tumours (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n2.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nDuodenal NETs are generally diagnosed by endoscopy and endoscopic\nultrasound. Computed tomography after ingestion of water to fill stom-\nach and duodenum, is recommended to help preoperative exploration.\nCT-enterography, MRI, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and 18F-DOPA-PET/CT are\nnot sufficiently accurate for localisation of well-differentiated gastrodu-\nodenal primary tumours,47–49 but these examinations are used to help\nstaging of regional and distant metastases.50\nLaboratory tests are required for patients newly diagnosed with\ndNET. It is especially important to recognise potential gastrinoma\n(serum gastrin, chromogranin and occasionally secretin testing). Other\nlaboratory tests, if symptoms are suggestive, may include somato-\nstatin, and very rarely growth hormone releasing factor and cortisol\nwith urinary 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid.38 If a diagnosis of genetic syn-\ndrome is suspected (e.g., MEN-I or NF1) specific laboratory tests and\ngermline testing is advised38,51 Distinguishing between dNET and\nneurofibromas may be difficult in some cases especially on axial\nimaging.\nRecommendations\n1. Locoregional and distant staging examiner actions for dNETs\ninclude contrast-enhanced CT (with water ingestion), liver -MRI\nand 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT (3b-B).\n2. Ruling out gastrinoma and screening for genetic syndromes when\nappropriate should be considered for dNETs (3b-B).\n2.3\n|\nManagement strategy for dNETs\nFactors that need to be considered prior to endoscopic resection of\ndNET are:\n1. Size of tumour (commonly estimated at EUS and OGD).\n2. Depth of invasion in relation to the deep muscle layer (estimated\nat EUS).\n3. Any evidence of lymphadenopathy and/or metastatic spread on\nEUS, liver-MRI, thoracoabdominal CT and functional imaging, pref-\nerably 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4. Grade and morphology of tumour (determined by endoscopy, EUS\nand endoscopic biopsy).\n5. Endoscopic\nappearance:\ncentral\ndepression/ulceration\nimplies\ninvasion.\n6. Suitability for endoscopic resection: size of lesion/endoscopic\naccess/location of lesion/proximity to ampulla.\n7. Hormone secretion status.\n8. Patient age and performance status.\nSize of the lesion is not a definitive guide to the correct treat-\nment. Treatment options are: endoscopic surveillance, endoscopic re-\nsection (by EMR/ESD/underwater EMR/over the scope clip), local\nduodenal resection (LR) or pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). The out-\ncomes may be related to the factors of the tumour at presentation\nrather than the type of resection procedure.52 The management of\ndNETs is summarised in Figure 3.\nWhen defining surgical indications for dNET, several key points\nshould be considered (see section 8.3).\n2.3.1\n|\nQ8 – When is endoscopic\nresection indicated?\nVery small non-functioning lesions 5 mm or less in D1 are commonly\nremoved after lifting injection and snare (or by diagnostic biopsy)\nbefore any histological diagnosis is made and these lesions do not\nusually recur or metastasise.\n8 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nFor younger and fitter patients who have lesions of 5–10 mm\n(and up to 15 mm in some centres), an opinion should be sought\nfrom therapeutic endoscopy about resection and the associated\nrisks. EUS should be performed as well as axial and functional imag-\ning. Most of these lesions are grade 1 and not invading the muscle\nlayer.\nIn\nthese\ncircumstances\nan\nendoscopic\nresection\nusing\nEMR/Cap EMR/ESD is reasonable, but risks of perforation are signif-\nicant, especially in D2. If endoscopic therapy is high risk (published\nrates of perforation 15%–25%) or unlikely to be curative, LR\n(i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision or enucleation) or pancrea-\ntoduodenectomy (PD) (if considered essential by the surgeon) should\nbe considered. Endoscopic therapy combined with laparoscopy for\nrescue in the event of perforation has been performed which may\nrepresent a novel and valuable alternative to ESD, able to guarantee\na\nhigh\nR0\nrate\nand\na\nlow\nrisk\nof\nintraoperative\nduodenal\nperforation.53\nDuodenal NETs can be multiple, particularly if they are gas-\ntrinomas, and an association with MEN-I exists. Somatostatino-\nmas\ncan\nalso\noccur\nin\nthe\nduodenum,\noften\nclose\nto\nthe\nampulla, but generally are without a clinical syndrome. There is\nan\nassociation\nwith\nNF1\n(functioning\ntumours\nare\nbeing\naddressed in a separate guidance paper on pancreatic func-\ntional NETs).\nRecommendations\n1. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 should be removed\nusing EMR type techniques (3b-C).\n2. Lesions of 5–10 mm (and up to 15 mm in some centres) can be\nremoved endoscopically after imaging work-up, but risks are rela-\ntively high (3b-C).\n2.3.2\n|\nQ9 – Can a “watch and wait” strategy be\nproposed in dNETs?\nA watch and wait policy could be considered for very small (<5 mm)\ndNETs that cannot easily be resected, are non-functional, G1 and not\ninvading the muscularis propria. This policy has usually been applied in\npatients unfit for endoscopic resection or surgery, since a more defini-\ntive therapy would be recommended in most cases, although a watch\nand wait policy has more recently been recommended as a result from\nsome small series with limited follow-up. It is not clear if watch and\nwait is a suitable option in a patient who is fit for resection.54,55\nRecommendations\nThere is very limited evidence for a watch and wait policy and generally\nthis is applied to those unfit for surgery or endoscopic resection (3b-C).\n2.3.3\n|\nQ10 – When is surgery indicated?\nData on nodal risk in very small non-functioning dNETs are scarce.\nSome series report nodal metastases as a common finding in patients\nwith dNET (40%–60%), with tumour size being the most relevant risk\nFIGURE 3\nManagement of duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs).\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n9 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Tumour location\nmay be another important feature to be considered when defining sur-\ngical indication. Lesions arising in the ampullary/periampullary area dif-\nfer from other dNETs due to a more aggressive biological behaviour in\nsome studies57 but not in others.56 Functioning neoplasms harbour a\nhigher metastatic potential.58 Tumour invasion beyond the submucosa,\ntumour grade G2–G3 and lymphovascular invasion are factors affecting\nthe risk of nodal metastases.\nDespite very low grade evidence surgical resection may be indi-\ncated in patients with dNETs showing any of the following features:\n1. Tumour size >10 mm; (some centres may advocate endoscopic\nremoval in 10–15 mm).\n2. Tumour extending beyond the submucosa.\n3. Tumour grade G2–G3.\n4. Lymphovascular invasion.\n5. Functioning neoplasms.\nRegarding the extent of resection, PD (pancreatoduodenectomy)\nand LR (local resection) represent the two main alternatives:\nIn general, pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy is the\nprocedure of choice for ampullary/periampullary neoplasms, due to\ntheir particular aggressiveness. When nodal metastases are pre- or\nintraoperatively identified, PD with nodal dissection is indicated in order\nto obtain a proper oncological clearance. However, for lesions <20 mm,\nless aggressive approaches (i.e., local excision with lymphadenectomy or\npancreas-sparing total duodenectomy) may be considered options. At\nleast eight lymph nodes should be harvested to stage patients accu-\nrately.59 However, radical surgery is associated with a high rate of\nshort- and long-term complications. Therefore, when feasible from an\noncological perspective, other surgical strategies should be considered.\nLocal duodenal resection (i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision\nor enucleation) represents a valuable and safe option, especially for\npatients with non-ampullary, non-functioning, dNET and without sus-\npected nodal involvement at staging,52 (where endoscopic resection is\nnot possible). The role of nodal dissection in this setting is unclear as\nrecent experience does not support the clearance of occult nodal\nmetastases due to lack of association with survival advantages.60\nRecommendations. 1. Surgery is recommended in cases of size >10–\n15 mm and/or tumour extending beyond the\nsubmucosa and/or grade G2-G3 and/or lym-\nphovascular invasion (3-B).\n3\n|\nMANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR\nGASTRIC AND DUODENAL G2–G3\nMETASTATIC NETS\n3.1\n|\nTreatment with curative intent\nDue to the lack of effective systemic therapeutic options surgery\nshould be evaluated even in the presence of metastatic condition\ndepending on the tumour spread and tumour biology if a complete\ntumour resection seems to be possible (R0-resection).\nGastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy includes the removal of\nlocoregional lymph nodes, so the presence of locoregional lymph\nnode metastases should not preclude surgery as a treatment option.\nIn dNET a transduodenal tumour excision with lymph node sampling\nor pancreatoduodenectomy are the treatments of choice.30 The com-\nplete resection of single or multiple liver metastases might be benefi-\ncial even for G3 tumours.61 Thus, surgical resection should be\nevaluated in G2 and in very selected cases of G3-NET depending on\nthe general health condition of the patient. Single or multiple metas-\ntases in other locations should be evaluated for a complete\nresection.\n3.2\n|\nWidespread metastatic disease\nIn the presence of metastases, a systemic therapeutic approach is\nsimilar to that recommended for advanced/unresectable NET from\nother primary sites, owing to the lack of available data in homoge-\nneous series of gastric or duodenal NETs. Somatostatin analogues\nare indicated for NETs G1–G2 with low Ki67 (<10%), and positive\nsomatostatin receptors but can be administered in tumours with\nhigher Ki-67 if slow tumour growth or slow progression are seen.\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid option\ndepending on the receptor status of the tumour. Molecular-\ntargeted therapy with everolimus is a therapeutic option, but with\nlimited\nevidence.62\nIn\nNET\nG3\nchemotherapy\nshould\nbe\nadministered.63\n3.3\n|\nPalliative primary tumour resection\nIn cases of unresectable distant metastases a palliative primary\ntumour resection can be considered rarely to avoid local complica-\ntions. The kind and extent of surgery has to be evaluated depending\non the location of the tumour and possibility of complications of sur-\ngery. A gastrectomy can be necessary in rare cases but a wedge resec-\ntion, distal or subtotal gastric resection should be preferred to reduce\nperioperative\nmorbidity.\nA\ngastric\nbypass\nwithout\ntumour\nre-\nsection should be favoured in case of bulky disease with infiltration of\nthe visceral arteries or pancreas.\n3.4\n|\nLocal recurrence\nIn the presence of local recurrence without diffuse metastatic spread,\noperative resection should be favoured to avoid bleeding or intestinal\nobstruction and to maintain quality of life. Even in the presence of dis-\ntant metastatic spread palliative surgery should be considered to\nensure quality of life depending on the tumour biology and the gen-\neral health status of the patient. Endoscopic procedures such as stent\nor jejunal catheterisation are alternatives for patients with a poor gen-\neral health status.\n10 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\n3.5\n|\nFollow-up\nThe interval for follow-up by contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT\nand/or liver-MRI, 3–12 months, should be based on the malignant\npotential of the tumour.64 Follow-up by additional 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT\nis helpful when the patient's clinical status and the results of CT or\nMRI and biochemistry are discordant. The sensitivity of 68Ga-SSA-\nPET-CT is superior to contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT for\ncharacterisation and detection of lymph node metastases and for visu-\nalisation of metastases to bone and liver,65 and therefore provides\nearlier detection of new lesions. FDG-PET/CT is instead used in G3\ntumours and can also be helpful in high G2 NET when 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT is negative. Re-evaluation of untreated patients should be per-\nformed at 3–6 month intervals.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgery with curative intention of metastatic gastroduodenal NET\nG1/G2/G3 should be performed, if a complete tumour (including\nmetastases) resection seems feasible (4-B).\n2. Palliative surgery (primary resection, bypass) may be indicated in\nmetastatic disease to maintain quality of life (4-C).\n3. The choice of systemic therapy for metastatic gastroduodenal NET\ndepends on tumour grading and includes biotherapy, everolimus,\nPRRT and chemotherapy (4-B).\n4\n|\nCONCLUSIONS\n4.1\n|\nGastric NETs\n1. Evaluation of the type of gNETs by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa is needed.\n2. Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm, whereas a surgical approach should be proposed in\ntumours larger than 2 cm. Tumours between 1 cm and 2 cm in size\nare usually managed by endoscopic resection after EUS evaluation,\nalthough surgery might be indicated in selected cases with G2\ntumours and high Ki-67 (cutoff not established), and in G3\ntumours.\n3. In type III gNETs, a surgical approach is recommended. However,\nin selected patients with small (<1 cm) G1 tumours, endoscopic re-\nsection may be appropriate.\n4.2\n|\nDuodenal NETs\n1. Endoscopic assessment should include tumour location to identify\nperiampullary tumours. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm.\n2. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 may be removed using\nEMR type techniques, whereas larger tumours (>1 cm) and/or\ntumour extending beyond the submucosa and/or grades G2–G3\nand/or lymphovascular invasion and/or functioning neoplasms\nshould be managed by a surgical approach after complete disease\nstaging by dedicated CT, liver-MRI+/\u0003 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4.3\n|\nUnmet needs\n1. The prognostic role of Ki67 in type I gNETs is unclear.\n2. Long-term outcomes of endoscopic resection for both selected\ngastric type 3 NETs, and also duodenal NETs, are lacking.\n3. The risk of progression in low-grade gastroduodenal NETs after\nincomplete R1 endoscopic resection is unknown.\n4. The role of somatostatin analogue treatments in managing type I\ngNETs has not yet been established.\n5. More data are required regarding natural history PPI-induced\ngNETs.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nFrancesco Panzuto: Conceptualization; methodology; supervision;\nwriting – original draft; writing – review and editing.

Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3).

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs. FDG is the tracer of choice\nfor G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose\nmetabolism and less SSTR expression than the low-grade\nNETs, for which the situation is usually the reverse.29 Com-\nbined SSTR imaging and FDG-PET-CT has been shown to be\ncomplementary for lesion detection. Findings of FDG-\npositive NETs at PET-CT indicate worse prognosis.29e31\nThe author panel believes that optimal diagnostic and\nprognostic information can be achieved by submitting all\nNET G2/G3 patients to PET-CT with both FDG and 68Ga-\nTable 3.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic\nradical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph\nnodes can be achieved in \u000480% of cases if carried out by\nexperienced surgeons.40\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locore-\ngional\ndisease\nin\nNET\nG1\nand\nG2.\nBefore\nany\nFigure 2.

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].

However, in aggressive NENs (NEC\nG3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy\n(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are\nwarranted.\nMedical therapy\nThe goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-\nassociated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].\nTreatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-\ntide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning\nNETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved\nin 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations\n[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also\nnamed biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in\nNETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the\nmultiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been\nintroduced more recently in the management of NETs.

SSAs are an established anti-\nproliferative therapy in metastatic GEP-NETs, based on two\nplacebo-controlled trials. Most frequently, they are used in\nﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the\nsettings in which they have been studied. Overall response\nrates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset. The\nmedian progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached\nwith lanreotide (>27 months) and was 18 months in the\nplacebo arm.59 The CLARINET extension study also showed\nefﬁcacy in\nprogressive\ndisease\npatients with\nentero-\npancreatic NETs.60 There is very good long-term tolerability\nof both SSAs.47,58,59 SSAs can be recommended for tumour\ngrowth control in advanced SSTR-positive, slowly-growing\nGI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I, A; European Society\nfor Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A; ESMO-\nMCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48]. There was a beneﬁt in terms of PFS prolon-\ngation in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56 (0.37e0.8)] and the\nlung NET subgroup [HR 0.5 (0.28e0.88)], and everolimus is\nEMA-approved for NF-GI and lung NETs. Everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive GI NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%).

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.\nThe stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.\nA watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

The NETTER-2 trial has recently been\ninitiated to address this issue (NCT03972488).\nTreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE is in general considered\nsafe, however, up to 3%e4% of the patients may develop\nirreversible bone marrow toxicity such as leukaemia or bone\nmarrow dysplasia. Mild renal toxicity grade 1/2 has been re-\nported long term in 30% of the patients (see Section 5 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline).\nFor more information about PRRT and SSA combination\nand maintenance therapy, see Section 6 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 A surgical approach is indicated in selected patients\naffected by stage IV GEP-NETs who show exclusive or pre-\ndominant liver disease after careful evaluation of tumour\ngrading, distribution of LMs and primary site [IV, B].\n\u0002 Upfront surgery is not indicated in the presence of extra-\nabdominal metastases and high-grade GEP-NENs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Presence of an advanced NEC G3 is considered an abso-\nlute contraindication for an upfront surgery [IV, A].\n\u0002 Palliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV,\nC]. However, it is controversial if primary tumour\nremoval in patients with stage IV disease translates to\nan improvement in survival.\n\u0002 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-\ntoms in patients affected by metastatic functioning\nSI-NETs [IV, B].\n\u0002 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms\nrelated to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery\nmay be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered\nin patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].\n\u0002 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].\n\u0002 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].\nHowever, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy\nwith platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].\n\u0002 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid\noptions for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with\nother systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.\nThe choice of the procedures depends on the local\nexpertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and\nthe localisation of liver involvement [V, C].\n\u0002 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be\napplied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve\ncontrol of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-\ntions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)\n[IV, A].\n\u0002 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,\nlocoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-\ntive to systemic treatment [IV, B].\n\u0002 Systemic therapy should be administered to control\ntumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth\n[I, A].\n\u0002 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients\nwith CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,\nglucagonoma) [I, A].\n\u0002 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-\ntristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-\nment to SSAs [I, A].\n\u0002 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve\nsymptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of\nIFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].\n\u0002 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].\n\u0002 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires\ncareful information to be given to the patient before and\ndirectly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper\ntreatment [IV, A].\n\u0002 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on\npathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth\nbehaviour and SSTR imaging.\n\u0002 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients\nwith low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable\ndisease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term\nfavourable prognosis.\n\u0002 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for\ntumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing\nSSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,\nA; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. Positive SSTR\nstatus is generally required but is not predictive of\nresponse.\n\u0002 IFN-a can be considered for antiproliferative therapy\nif other treatment options have been exploited or\nare not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative on functional\nimaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where there\nare fewer therapy options compared with Pan-NETs\n[IV, B].\n\u0002 Everolimus is EMA-approved for progressive Pan-NET G1/\nG2 with or without prior ChT, for NF-GI and lung NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In GI NETs, everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive disease [I, A].\n\u0002 The use of everolimus after PRRT is recommended in\nintestinal NETs, if PRRT is available [V, A], although the\ntreatment sequence needs to be further studied in the\nabsence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\n\u0002 The combination therapy of SSA and everolimus for an\nantiproliferative purpose is not recommended [II, D].\nM. Pavel et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 7\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.304\n855\n\n---\n\u0002 Sunitinib is one of the EMA-approved treatment options\nin advanced progressive Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1\nscore: 3].\n\u0002 Both sunitinib and everolimus cannot be recommended\nin NEC G3 outside of clinical trials [V, E].\n\u0002 The use of systemic ChT is recommended in advanced\nPan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A].\nB In patients with non-resectable LMs and/or other\ndistant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs, STZ/5-FU is\nrecommended in progressive disease [II, A].\nB TEM alone or in combination with CAP is recommen-\nded as alternative ChT in Pan-NETs [II, B].\nB Systemic ChT can also be recommended in bulky\ndisease\nwithout\nprior\ntumour\nprogression\nin\nPan-NETs [II, B].\nB Cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide is recommen-\nded standard ﬁrst-line ChT in NEC G3 [III, A]. There is\nno established second-line therapy, but different\nregimens [e.g. 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI),\n5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin\n(FOLFOX),\nCAPTEM\n\u0006\nbevacizumab] may be considered [IV, B].\n\u0002 In NET G3, response rates to cisplatin/etoposide are\nlow, and the use of this combination is not recommen-\nded [IV, C].\n\u0002 ChT cannot be recommended in well-differentiated\nslowly growing NETs of the GI tract [II, C]; exceptions\nmay be rapidly progressive tumours or NET G2 with\nhigher Ki-67 close to NET G3 [V, C].\n\u0002 PRRT is recommended as second-line therapy in patients\nwith midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs who\nfulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT [I, A].\n\u0002 177Lu-DOTATATE is EMA- and FDA-approved for patients\nwith midgut NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] and\nPan-NETs [III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4].\n\u0002 In Pan-NETs, PRRT should be used after failure of\napproved therapies [III, A].\n\u0002 In carefully selected patients, PRRT may be considered in\nNET G3 [IV, C].\n\u0002 SSA should be combined with PRRT in patients with\nfunctioning tumours (CS) to prevent increasing symp-\ntoms such as diarrhoea and/or ﬂushing and hormonal\ncrisis soon after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 It is also common practice to continue SSA beyond PRRT\nin functioning tumours, as a full resolution of CS-related\nsymptoms is rarely achieved after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 The combination of SSA with PRRT is not recommended\nin patients with NF-NETs, [IV, C] and it remains unclear if\nSSA should be continued after PRRT as a maintenance\ntherapy.\nPERSONALISED MEDICINE\nIn the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity of\ncomparative\nrandomised\ntrials,\ntherapy\nselection\nin\nadvanced non-resectable disease is frequently based on\nindividual patient clinical and pathological features and\nSSTR imaging [IV, A]. Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence. NSE and\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be monitored in NEC;\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Conventional imaging\nincludes thoracic and abdominal scans every 2e3 months.\nFDG-PET may be required in case of suspected recurrence to\ndiscriminate lesions from unspeciﬁc ﬁndings; otherwise,\nhigh-resolution CT is the imaging method of choice, unless\nresection is considered in locally advanced NEN G3,\nwhere FDG-PET is mandatory to exclude distant metastatic\ndisease.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional\nand SSTR imaging [V, B].\n\u0002 In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1eG2, it is recom-\nmended that imaging is carried out every 3e6 months\n(CT or MRI), and in NEC G3 every 2e3 months [V, C].\nSimilar staging intervals apply to advanced disease.\n\u0002 Follow-up should be lifelong, although the staging inter-\nvals may be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up.\n\u0002 Small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix or rectum do not need any follow-up if\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in\naccordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures\nfor Clinical Practice Guidelines development, http://www.\nesmo.org/Guidelines/ESMOGuidelines-Methodology.\nThe\nrelevant literature has been selected by the expert authors.\nAn ESMO-MCBS table with ESMO-MCBS scores is included\nin supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.107 Levels of evidence and grades of recommenda-\ntion have been applied using the system shown in\nsupplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.108 Statements without grading were considered\njustiﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts and the\nESMO Faculty.

Type I gNETs are indolent,\nwith negligible risk of metastases (<5%) and excellent long-term sur-\nvival (almost 100%); the prognosis of a patient with type II gNETs\nneeds to be assessed in the context of MEN-I syndrome; however,\nthe risk of metastases may vary between 10% and 30%. Type III\ntumours are usually more aggressive, owing to the high prevalence\nof metastatic disease (>50%) and the more unfavourable long-term\nsurvival (5-year survival rate 70%), although they present well-\ndifferentiated morphology in the majority of cases. Type III gNENs\nmay also have higher grades. The key questions discussed in the pre-\nsent paper are summarised in Table 1. Data were identified by MED-\nLINE database searches and expert opinion/recommendations given\naccording to the best available evidence and the authors’ experi-\nence. Each recommendation for treatment and diagnosis will have a\nlevel of evidence and grade of recommendation as per the GRADE\nsystem (Table S1). The major features of gNETs are summarised in\nTable 2.\n1.2\n|\nAssessment of gastric neuroendocrine\ntumours\n1.2.1\n|\nPathology\nGastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs) are different from other\ngastrointestinal NETs as in the stomach a clear aetiology is emerging\nwhere gastric NETs are induced in the context of hyperplasia of\nenterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. In 1993 an aetiological framework\nfor gastric NETs was reported,2 where gastric NETs were either\nfound in a setting of ECL cell hyperplasia associated with high gas-\ntrin levels due to autoimmune fundic atrophic gastritis (type I NETs),\nhigh gastrin levels due to gastrinoma (type II NETs) or without ECL\nhyperplasia (type III NETs). More recently, general atrophy in chronic\nH. pylori associated gastritis,3 functional failure of parietal cells due\nto mutations4 or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use5 have also been\nreported to be associated with NETs, some with a background of\nECL cell hyperplasia but in cases of proton pump inhibition also\nassociated with parietal cell hyperplasia. These newly described gas-\ntric NETs are similar to the originally described type I gNETs as they\nare secondary to failed acid secretion. The secondary (type I and\ntype II) gNETs have a more indolent course2,5 and can be reversible\nif the cause can be impeded. It is therefore important to recognise\nthe associated gastric mucosal changes.6\nAdequate tumour sampling is essential for grading NETs as pre-\nscribed in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of gas-\ntrointestinal tumours of 2019.7 As NETs are usually located deep in\nthe mucosa (not at the surface) attention should be paid to this when\ntaking biopsies.\nGastric NETs are graded using the same criteria as for all gastroin-\ntestinal sites:8\nG1: mitotic count <2 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index <3% in hotspot\nof at least 500 cells.\nG2: mitotic count between 2 and 20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index\nbetween 3% and 20% in hotspot of at least 500 cells.\nG3: mitotic count >20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20% in hot-\nspot of at least 500 cells.\n1.2.2\n|\nEndoscopy\nThe primary diagnostic tool for gNETs is oesophagogastroduode-\nnoscopy (OGD). For the assessment of gastric NETs, not only rep-\nresentative biopsies of the tumour but also biopsies of the\nsurrounding mucosa and other parts of the stomach (antrum and\nbody-fundus) are essential as these give clues on the nature/\naetiology and, with this, the prognosis and treatment of the NET.\nIn addition, sampling of gastric juice for pH measurement is\nstrongly encouraged. Furthermore, virtual chromoendoscopy (nar-\nrow-band imaging, blue light imaging, i-scan) may be useful to pro-\nvide\nadditional\ninformation\nto\nidentify\nfield\nchanges\nor\nprecancerous lesions in underlying atrophic mucosa.9 In addition\nto OGD, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be performed in all\nlesions >1 cm regardless of type and in all lesions of type III\nregardless of size, unless large or metastatic lesions are found.\nReporting should include size of the lesion infiltration depth and\nassessment of local lymph nodes.\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of gNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to evaluate proliferative activity of the tumour (Ki67\nand/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\nTABLE 1\nList of questions.\nGASTRIC NET\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic resection for type I gNETs?

Evaluation of the type of gNET by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n1.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nBiomarker assessment should include fasting gastrin and chromo-\ngranin A (CgA). Whereas gastrin may be useful to differentiate\nbetween different types (elevated in type I and type II, normal in\ntype III), CgA is only useful as a tumour marker in type III gNETs.\nIn the presence of ongoing PPI therapy gastrin and CgA are not\ndiagnostic and are difficult to interpret. In general, caution should\nbe used when evaluating CgA values, considering the different\ndiagnostic accuracy of available assays. Parietal cell and intrinsic\nfactor antibodies, vitamin B12 and thyroid function parameters\nshould be measured in suspected cases of autoimmune gastritis.\nWhereas type I gNETs do not usually require additional cross-\nsectional imaging, type III gNETs should undergo cross-sectional\nimaging – liver contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nand/or contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography\n(CT), with previous ingestion of water immediately before examina-\ntion, to fill stomach and duodenum and better depict small enhancing\nlesion in the arterial phase, and functional imaging, preferentially\nsomatostatin receptor PET/CT (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT).\nThese should also be considered in cases of type I gNETs with\nmetastases on EUS or high-risk features of metastases (G2, lymphatic\nor vascular invasion, size ≥1 cm). Recently, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT has\nbeen suggested in selected cases with tumour diameter >1 cm, G2\ntumours (perhaps Ki-67 > 10 but exact cutoff not determined), or R1\nmargins after endoscopic resection.10\nPrognosis depends on type, size, grading, histological risk factors\n(e.g., lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion), completeness of\nresection and initial tumour stage.\nRecommendations\n1. Gastrin assessment is useful to differentiate between different\ntypes of gNETs. CgA is useful as tumour marker only in type III\ngNETs (3b-A).\n2. Cross-sectional radiological imaging (CT/MRI) and 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT are not required in type I gNETs, unless metastases on EUS or\nin the presence of high-risk features (G2, vessel invasion, sus-\npected T2 on EUS ) (3b–A).\n1.3\n|\nManagement strategy for type I gNETs\n1.3.1\n|\nIntroduction\nTreatment options for type I gNETs include surveillance, endoscopic\nresection, somatostatin analogues (SSA) and eventually surgery. As\nprognosis is usually quite favourable and tumour growth slow and risk\nof metastases is below 1% in tumours <10 mm, all NET <1 cm can be\nobserved without any need for intervention.11,12 The ideal schedule\nfor observational OGD is not defined and clinical practice ranges from\nevery 6 months to every 2 years. Planning the first follow-up after\n6 months and then every 12 months is the most widely used\napproach. A regular rebiopsy of lesions is not necessary unless atypi-\ncal features (e.g., ulceration, erosion, pitting) appear, suggesting inva-\nsive progression of the lesion. The management of type I gNETs is\nsummarised in Figure 1.\n1.3.2\n|\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic\nresection for type I gNETs? Is additional treatment\nrequired in cases of R1 endoscopic resection?\nEndoscopic resection should be considered for type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm and for those lesions demonstrating increased Ki-67 as\nthese features are associated with an increased risk of metastases and\nprogression.11,13 Many small type I gNETs are G1 or low G2\n(Ki-67 < 10%);14 however, a Ki-67 cutoff has not been defined to\ndetermined when excision should be performed. Endoscopic ultraso-\nnography to determine depth of local invasion and assessment of local\nlymph nodes should be performed in lesions >1 cm and in smaller\ntumours with “high” G2 grade (cutoff not established) before any\nresection. No other imaging modality is required at this stage. The re-\nsection technique of choice depends on size and position of the\nlesion, invasion depth and local experience. Endoscopic mucosal re-\nsection (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and full-\nthickness resection (FTR) are all associated with a low risk profile for\nboth bleeding and perforation. It is not clear which is the best endo-\nscopic technique to be used for achieving a complete R0 resection.15\nHowever, resection by ESD or FTR achieve higher rates of R0 resec-\ntion, but no randomised trials have compared all techniques head-to-\nhead.16,17 For R1 resection status a re-resection in a “step-up”\napproach could be recommended (e.g., ESD after EMR, FTR after\nESD), although data showing risk of local recurrence after R1\nTABLE 2\nDiagnostic criteria and prognosis of gNET subtypes.\nType\nGastric pH\nHistology of surrounding mucosa\nGastrin levels\nGrading\nPrognosis\nI\nHigh\nGastric body atrophy, ECL-cell\nhyperplasia\nHigh\nG1 (G2)\nExcellent: Risk of metastases very low.

Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm (2b-A).\n2. ESD and FTR are more effective to achieve R0 resection compared\nto EMR (2b-B).\n3. In case of incomplete resection (R1) of a NET >1 cm a step-up\napproach (EMR > ESD > FTR > surgery) is recommended (4-C).\n1.3.3\n|\nQ2 – When should somatostatin analogues\nbe used to treat type I gNETs?\nType I gNETs usually express somatostatin receptors. Thus, therapy\nwith SSA can be initiated in metastasised patients or patients not\namenable to endoscopic or surgical resection (e.g., difficult location,\nold age, comorbidities). SSA therapy is associated with a high com-\nplete response rate of 25%–100%, but relapse is frequently observed\nafter discontinuation of therapy.20 Thus, continuous therapy would be\nthe appropriate approach. Another reason for starting SSA therapy\ncould be large tumour size or the requirement of repeated endoscopic\nresection for progressive lesions, although data evaluating this\napproach are lacking. Another therapeutic approach could be direct\ninhibition of gastrin signalling in tumour cells. Indeed, the gastrin\nreceptor\ninhibitor\nnetazepide\nhas\nbeen\nevaluated\nin\na\nproof-\nof-concept phase II trial with 16 patients showing a complete\nresponse rate in 30% of patients.21 Like SSA treatment, tumour\nrelapse after discontinuation was observed in all patients. The clinical\nbenefit of netazepide needs to be evaluated in larger randomised clini-\ncal trials before any recommendation for its use can be formulated.\nRecommendations\n1. In type I gNET patients when tumour resection is indicated but\nendoscopic or surgical techniques are not possible, SSA therapy is\nappropriate (2b-A).\n1.3.4\n|\nQ3 – What is the recommended follow-up\nschedule in type I gNETs?\nAn endoscopic follow-up every 12 months is recommended after\ncomplete endoscopic resection of a type I gNET. Whether this interval\ncan be increased after prolonged periods without evidence of relapse\nor whether the interval should be shortened in case of incomplete\n(R1) resection or risk factors associated with progression (grading G2,\nsize >20 mm) should be carefully discussed with the patient. In gen-\neral, no cross-sectional imaging is required for follow-up. In addition,\nrepeated evaluation of biomarkers CgA and gastrin should not be per-\nformed as these markers are elevated due to the underlying CAG and\nare not an indicator of relapse or progression. Follow-up OGD is\nrecommended in a type I gNET that does not require resection,\nalthough the optimal interval for planning endoscopy is not estab-\nlished\n(1–2 years\ncan\nbe\nconsidered,\nfollowing\nfirst\nfollow-up\n6–12 months after initial diagnosis). Apart from risk of tumour pro-\ngression or relapse after resection in NET lesions, patients with CAG\nFIGURE 1\nManagement of type I gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n4 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Although\nonly one international guideline recommends a regular endoscopic\nfollow-up for patients with CAG, the yearly rate of adenocarcinoma\ndetection is up to 1% in patients with type I gNETs.14 Whether this\nreflects an increased risk of adenocarcinoma development in patients\nwith a previous diagnosis of gNET is not clear. For CAG patients with-\nout a gNET, intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection have been\nlinked to an increased risk of adenocarcinoma progression. Given the\nhigh risk of adenocarcinoma detection upon follow-up of gNETs, this\nsupports the recommendation to perform an endoscopic follow-up\nevery 12–24 months in patients with previously diagnosed gNETs\n(specific timing may be proposed according to tumour size and histo-\nlogical features), whereas a 3-year interval is recommended in CAG\npatients without gNETs.22\nRecommendations\n1. An endoscopic follow-up by OGD is recommended 12 months\nafter complete endoscopic resection of type I gNET (2b-B).\n2. In\nthose\nnot\nrequiring\nresection\nfirst\nfollow-up\nshould\nbe\n12 months and then consider annual to every 1–2 years (2b-B).\n3. In patients with type I gNET, endoscopic follow-up by OGD is\nrecommended also given the risk of developing gastric adenocarci-\nnoma related to CAG (2b-A).\n1.3.5\n|\nQ4 – When is surgery recommended for\ntype I gNETs?\nAlthough type I gNETs are usually treated by an endoscopic approach,\nupfront surgical resection is recommended in all tumours that are\ngreater than 20 mm in size or with suspected muscolaris propria inva-\nsion (either on axial imaging or EUS). In addition, surgery could be\nconsidered in tumours showing high risk features on biopsy (e.g., high\ngrade 2 NET [cutoff not established], lymphovascular invasion). A lim-\nited resection with sampling of local lymph nodes is the preferred\napproach. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy should be\ndiscussed in patients with known lymph node metastases or might be\nproposed as a completion procedure after final histology has proven\nlymphatic spread, although there are no solid data supporting this\noption.\nEndoscopic resection should not be attempted in the presence of\ninvasion into the muscularis propria, suspected lymph node metasta-\nses or high-risk features of metastatic spread (e.g., high Ki-67, vascular\ninvasion, size >20 mm). These patients should receive full staging\nincluding cross-sectional imaging as described previously and 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT and upfront surgical management. The optimal cutoff\nvalue for Ki-67 is not determined, but Ki-67 values above 10% should\ntrigger evaluation of surgical treatment. In the rare instance of a G3\ntype I gNET a primarily surgical approach is recommended due to high\nrisk of metastases.23 Regarding tumour size, no clear cutoff for surgi-\ncal management can be defined. Only limited data exist on tumour\nsize and risk of metastases in the subgroup of type I gNETs. Data from\nthe SEER database and from a large series from Taiwan showed that a\ncutoff of 20 mm was associated with an increased risk of lymph node\nmetastases.13,24\nIn case of incomplete endoscopic resection (R1) or risk features in\nfinal pathology after endoscopic resection, a surgical approach should\nbe discussed with the patient to achieve R0 resection and/or re-\nsection of local lymph nodes to exclude metastatic spread. In cases of\nlesions not amenable to an endoscopic approach (e.g., location close\nto cardia) a primary surgical resection might be necessary.\nSSA treatment to reduce gastrin production, thus diminishing the\nstimulus for further tumour growth and progression, could be pro-\nposed in patients who could not undergo resection or for multiple\nlarger tumours or frequent relapse. Antrectomy should no longer be\nroutinely offered but might be an option in patients not tolerating\nSSA or declining continuous application.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgical approach is recommended in tumours >20 mm or with\nsuspected muscolaris propria invasion (either on axial imaging or\nEUS). In addition, surgery could be considered (in tumours show-\ning high risk features on biopsies (high Ki-67, lymphovascular inva-\nsion) (2b-A).\n2. Limited resection with local nodal sampling is the preferred surgical\nstrategy (3b-A).\n3. Gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy (specific kind of re-\nsection according with the tumour site) should be discussed in\npatients with known lymph node metastases or might be proposed\nas a completion procedure after final histology has proven lym-\nphatic spread after full exploration with cross sectional imaging\n(3b-A).\n1.4\n|\nType II gNETs\nType II gNETs are the rarest type of gNET (5% of cases). They arise in\nthe context of hypergastrinaemia associated with ZES which may\noccur in patients with MEN-I. Treatment of patients with type II\ngNETs\nstrictly\ndepends\non\nthe\nmanagement\nof\nthe\nMEN-I\nsyndrome.25\n1.5\n|\nManagement strategy for type III gNETS\n1.5.1\n|\nBackground\nType III gNETs have been traditionally regarded as highly aggressive\ntumours requiring extended surgical resections (i.e., partial or total\ngastrectomy) with lymphadenectomy. However, with the widespread\nuse of high-definition endoscopy, type III gNETs of smaller size and\nlower grade are increasingly being detected. A recent systematic\nreview of 147 type III gNENs in which tumour management was\nreported found that \u000145% were G1, 35% were G2 and 20% were\nG3.26 As a result, less invasive treatment options, ranging from endo-\nscopic resection to surgical wedge resection, have been investigated\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n5 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

The management of type III gNETs is sum-\nmarised in Figure 2.\n1.5.2\n|\nQ5 – Can endoscopic treatments be\nproposed to treat type III gNETs?\nType III gNETs should be carefully characterised using endoscopy,\nbiopsy, cross sectional thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI, and often\nfunctional imaging (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT or FDG/PET-CT depending on\ntumour grade) and in most cases EUS. Evidence from several retro-\nspective\ncase\nseries\nsuggests\nthat\ncarefully\nselected\npatients\nwho have no evidence of lymph node involvement can be safely and\nsuccessfully\nmanaged\nby\nendoscopic\nresection.\nEndoscopic\nre-\nsection appears to be most appropriate in patients who have localised\nG1 tumours ≤10 mm in diameter, because tumours greater than this\nsize are more likely to have lymph node metastases (even though\nthese may not be detected by imaging techniques).26,27 However\nendoscopic resection can also be considered in patients with slightly\nlarger tumours (<15 mm) and low G2 (Ki-67 3–10%) histology, partic-\nularly if the risks of surgical resection are considered to be high.26\nCurrent evidence does not support the use of a particular endoscopic\nresection technique (EMR vs. ESD).26 Some very small (<5 mm)\ntumours have also been unintentionally removed by avulsion biopsy\nwith no evidence of subsequent tumour recurrence, but this approach\nis\nnot\ngenerally\nrecommended.26\nPatients\nwith\npositive\nre-\nsection margins (R1) should be considered for additional endoscopic\nresection or surgical salvage if appropriate. Patients who have under-\ngone endoscopic resection should have close follow up with endos-\ncopy and imaging (thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI) to detect local\nand distant tumour recurrence.\nRecommendations\n1. Endoscopic resection may be considered in patients who have\nlocalised type III G1 gNETs ≤10 mm, and occasionally larger\ntumours with Ki-67 <10% and <15 mm in diameter if the risks of\nsurgical\nresection\nare\nhigh\nprovided\nadequate\nstaging\nis\nallowed (3a–C).\n1.5.3\n|\nQ6 – When should limited or extended\nsurgical treatments be proposed to treat type III\ngNETs?\nSeveral clinicopathological features should be carefully evaluated to\nidentify the best surgical option (limited vs. extended resection) for\npatients with type III gNETs.\nA limited gastric wedge resection without standard lymphade-\nnectomy can be considered as treatment option in patients with loca-\nlised, G1 type III gNETs with no evidence of lymph node involvement\non preoperative imaging (including EUS).26 In patients fulfilling the\nabove-mentioned criteria, tumour size, depth of infiltration and pres-\nence of lymphovascular invasion should be further assessed to define\nthe extent of surgical resection. Therefore, a wedge resection can be\nsafely proposed to patients with G1 type III gNETs <20 mm, limited to\nthe submucosal layer and with no evidence of lymphovascular inva-\nsion.26,28 The role of wedge resections in patients with G2 type III gNETs\nremains debated, as tumour grade represents a powerful predictor of dis-\nease aggressiveness. Similarly, the tumour size cutoff for proposing lim-\nited surgical resection is not clearly defined. Type III gNETs <10 mm are\nusually managed with endoscopic resection, whereas a limited surgical re-\nsection might be considered as initial treatment option for lesions measur-\ning >10 mm and <20 mm.26 Recent experiences report favourable\nFIGURE 2\nManagement of type III gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n6 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Radical surgery is recommended as second-line treatment\nwhen final histology reveals one or more of the following findings: pres-\nence of nodal metastases, higher tumour grade compared with original\nbiopsy, lymphovascular invasion or lack of complete tumour clearance\n(R1), in patients initially managed with a limited wedge resection.26\nRecommendations\n1. A limited wedge resection with local nodal sampling (without standard\nlymphadenectomy) can be considered as a treatment option in patients\nwith localised, G1–G2 type III gNETs, with no evidence of lymphade-\nnopathy on full staging preoperative imaging (including EUS) (2b-B).\n2. Radical surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is recommended in\ntype III gNETs when nodal metastases are found/suspected on preop-\nerative staging, if Ki67 >20% or tumour diameter >20 mm (2b-B).\n1.5.4\n|\nQ7 – What scheduled follow-up is\nrecommended after endoscopic/surgical resection of\ntype III gNETs?\nFollow-up of patients who underwent surgical resection of type III\ngNETs is based on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging (thora-\ncoabdominal CT/liver-MRI with sometimes OGD and/or EUS or func-\ntional imaging [68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and/or FDG-PET/CT depending on\nthe tumour grade]). The timing of follow-up has never been clearly\ndefined. When a total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is per-\nformed, the follow-up schedule adopted for gastric adenocarcinoma\nshould be applied.26 On the other hand, patients managed conserva-\ntively (endoscopic or surgical local excision) should undergo OGD\nafter about 3 months to check the resection site and if this shows no\nmacroscopic residual tumour, they should have regular follow-up with\ncross-sectional imaging and endoscopy/EUS. The frequency and\nchoice of test will be influenced by the final tumour size and grade as\nwell as patient fitness and in most cases, it will be possible to reduce\nthe frequency of follow up as time progresses after resection. 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT (or FDG-PET/CT depending on the tumour grade) and\nbiopsies should be performed in the presence of a suspected disease\nrelapse, but they are not routinely part of the follow-up programme.30\nRecommendations\n1. Radiological follow-up by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recom-\nmended in patients treated by surgical resection for type III gNETs (5-A).\n2\n|\nDUODENAL NEUROENDOCRINE\nTUMOURS\n2.1\n|\nIntroduction – general background\nLike gNETs, duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs) are rare\ntumours but also with an increasing incidence found mostly at OGD\nor axial imaging for other reasons (incidental discovery) but also can\nbe found as primaries at workup for patients with stage 4 diseases or\nmore rarely as part of inherited syndromes such as MEN-I and neuro-\nfibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Most dNETs are non-functional tumours,\nbut duodenal tumours secreting gastrin are not infrequent (either spo-\nradic or as part of MEN-I) and more rarely tumours secreting somato-\nstatin (so called somatostatinomas) (see Guidance paper on functional\npancreatic NETs).\nThe overall incidence of dNETs is low accounting for only 2.8% of\nall NETs.31,32 The annual age adjusted incidence for dNET has been\nreported to be 0.19 per 100,000.32 Traditionally, dNETs have been\nclassified into non-functioning (approximately 90% of lesions) or func-\ntioning tumours (those secreting specific peptides of hormones elicit-\ning a functional clinical consequence or syndrome)33 and can be\nsummarised as:\n1. Non-functioning dNETs (they can secrete peptides and substances\nnot resulting in a clinical condition or syndrome).\n2. Duodenal composite gangliocytoma/neuroma and neuroendocrine\ntumour (CogNET) (previously known as gangliocytic paragan-\nglioma), occurs almost exclusively in the second part of the duode-\nnum and periampullary region and is considered a composite\ntumour of epithelial NETs and ganglioneuroma.34\n3. Duodenal gastrinoma (gastrin secreting and either sporadic or part\nof MEN-I where duodenal localisation is very frequent) and soma-\ntostatinomas (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance\npaper on functioning pancreatic NETs).\n4. Duodenal NEC (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance\npaper for digestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).\n2.2\n|\nAssessment of dNETs\n2.2.1\n|\nPathology\nPathological assessment and grading of dNETs is like that of NETs of\nall other sites. Adequate sampling is needed and the deep mucosal\nlocation of these lesions, usually suspected by the endoscopist due to\nthe smooth surface as opposed to the more common adenomas and\ncarcinomas of the duodenum, warrants an attempt to perform deep\nbiopsies. Morphologically, the main differential diagnosis in the duo-\ndenum is the CoGNET, previously classified as a ganglioneuroma or\nparaganglioma, but now shown to be more similar to NETs.36,37\nIn cases with a high proliferation rate (i.e., mitotic count >20 in\n2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20%), NEC and adenocarcinoma with\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n7 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nneuroendocrine features should be ruled out (see guidance paper for\ndigestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).\n2.2.2\n|\nEndoscopy\nMost dNETs are in the first or second part of the duodenum.38 Symp-\ntoms range from mostly none at incidental discovery to symptoms\nattributed to gastric outlet obstruction (in rare cases of large lesions)\nor anaemia. Patients with dNETs close to the ampulla and CoGNET\nwhich occur in the periampullary region can present with gastrointes-\ntinal bleeding, abdominal pain, anaemia or jaundice.38,39 Periampullary\ndNETs are not infrequent in patients with neurofibromatosis type\n1 (NF1), also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease including\nsomatostatinomas.40,41\nAt OGD, dNETs have similar features to gNETs but are typically\nsingle small sessile, erythematous or pale lesions in the duodenal cap,\nbulb or D1 to D2.6 In recent years, increasingly smaller lesions have\nbeen detected, owing to the better mucosal visualisation with modern\nendoscopic tools. The reported mean size of dNETs varies between\n7 mm and 1.5 cm.42 Up to 10% of dNETs can occur as multiple\ntumours, which should prompt a diagnosis of MEN-I. It has been\nreported that approximately a quarter to a third of patients with\ndNETs and ZES, have undiagnosed MEN-I.43,44\nEndoscopic characterisation of dNETs has been described by Bor-\nbath and colleagues.6 Diagnosis is usually confirmed at endoscopic\nforceps biopsy (care as very small lesions may be almost completely\nexcised at biopsy sampling and making future identification hard in\ncase of R1 resection). Tumours of 1 cm or above should have accurate\nlocal staging by EUS as regional lymph node metastases occur in up to\n40%–60% of cases, especially in duodenal gastrinomas.43,45,46\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of dNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate proliferative activ-\nity of the tumour (Ki-67 and/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\n2. Endoscopic assessment of dNETs should include tumour location\nto identify periampullary tumours (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n2.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nDuodenal NETs are generally diagnosed by endoscopy and endoscopic\nultrasound. Computed tomography after ingestion of water to fill stom-\nach and duodenum, is recommended to help preoperative exploration.\nCT-enterography, MRI, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and 18F-DOPA-PET/CT are\nnot sufficiently accurate for localisation of well-differentiated gastrodu-\nodenal primary tumours,47–49 but these examinations are used to help\nstaging of regional and distant metastases.50\nLaboratory tests are required for patients newly diagnosed with\ndNET. It is especially important to recognise potential gastrinoma\n(serum gastrin, chromogranin and occasionally secretin testing). Other\nlaboratory tests, if symptoms are suggestive, may include somato-\nstatin, and very rarely growth hormone releasing factor and cortisol\nwith urinary 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid.38 If a diagnosis of genetic syn-\ndrome is suspected (e.g., MEN-I or NF1) specific laboratory tests and\ngermline testing is advised38,51 Distinguishing between dNET and\nneurofibromas may be difficult in some cases especially on axial\nimaging.\nRecommendations\n1. Locoregional and distant staging examiner actions for dNETs\ninclude contrast-enhanced CT (with water ingestion), liver -MRI\nand 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT (3b-B).\n2. Ruling out gastrinoma and screening for genetic syndromes when\nappropriate should be considered for dNETs (3b-B).\n2.3\n|\nManagement strategy for dNETs\nFactors that need to be considered prior to endoscopic resection of\ndNET are:\n1. Size of tumour (commonly estimated at EUS and OGD).\n2. Depth of invasion in relation to the deep muscle layer (estimated\nat EUS).\n3. Any evidence of lymphadenopathy and/or metastatic spread on\nEUS, liver-MRI, thoracoabdominal CT and functional imaging, pref-\nerably 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4. Grade and morphology of tumour (determined by endoscopy, EUS\nand endoscopic biopsy).\n5. Endoscopic\nappearance:\ncentral\ndepression/ulceration\nimplies\ninvasion.\n6. Suitability for endoscopic resection: size of lesion/endoscopic\naccess/location of lesion/proximity to ampulla.\n7. Hormone secretion status.\n8. Patient age and performance status.\nSize of the lesion is not a definitive guide to the correct treat-\nment. Treatment options are: endoscopic surveillance, endoscopic re-\nsection (by EMR/ESD/underwater EMR/over the scope clip), local\nduodenal resection (LR) or pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). The out-\ncomes may be related to the factors of the tumour at presentation\nrather than the type of resection procedure.52 The management of\ndNETs is summarised in Figure 3.\nWhen defining surgical indications for dNET, several key points\nshould be considered (see section 8.3).\n2.3.1\n|\nQ8 – When is endoscopic\nresection indicated?\nVery small non-functioning lesions 5 mm or less in D1 are commonly\nremoved after lifting injection and snare (or by diagnostic biopsy)\nbefore any histological diagnosis is made and these lesions do not\nusually recur or metastasise.\n8 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nFor younger and fitter patients who have lesions of 5–10 mm\n(and up to 15 mm in some centres), an opinion should be sought\nfrom therapeutic endoscopy about resection and the associated\nrisks. EUS should be performed as well as axial and functional imag-\ning. Most of these lesions are grade 1 and not invading the muscle\nlayer.\nIn\nthese\ncircumstances\nan\nendoscopic\nresection\nusing\nEMR/Cap EMR/ESD is reasonable, but risks of perforation are signif-\nicant, especially in D2. If endoscopic therapy is high risk (published\nrates of perforation 15%–25%) or unlikely to be curative, LR\n(i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision or enucleation) or pancrea-\ntoduodenectomy (PD) (if considered essential by the surgeon) should\nbe considered. Endoscopic therapy combined with laparoscopy for\nrescue in the event of perforation has been performed which may\nrepresent a novel and valuable alternative to ESD, able to guarantee\na\nhigh\nR0\nrate\nand\na\nlow\nrisk\nof\nintraoperative\nduodenal\nperforation.53\nDuodenal NETs can be multiple, particularly if they are gas-\ntrinomas, and an association with MEN-I exists. Somatostatino-\nmas\ncan\nalso\noccur\nin\nthe\nduodenum,\noften\nclose\nto\nthe\nampulla, but generally are without a clinical syndrome. There is\nan\nassociation\nwith\nNF1\n(functioning\ntumours\nare\nbeing\naddressed in a separate guidance paper on pancreatic func-\ntional NETs).\nRecommendations\n1. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 should be removed\nusing EMR type techniques (3b-C).\n2. Lesions of 5–10 mm (and up to 15 mm in some centres) can be\nremoved endoscopically after imaging work-up, but risks are rela-\ntively high (3b-C).\n2.3.2\n|\nQ9 – Can a “watch and wait” strategy be\nproposed in dNETs?\nA watch and wait policy could be considered for very small (<5 mm)\ndNETs that cannot easily be resected, are non-functional, G1 and not\ninvading the muscularis propria. This policy has usually been applied in\npatients unfit for endoscopic resection or surgery, since a more defini-\ntive therapy would be recommended in most cases, although a watch\nand wait policy has more recently been recommended as a result from\nsome small series with limited follow-up. It is not clear if watch and\nwait is a suitable option in a patient who is fit for resection.54,55\nRecommendations\nThere is very limited evidence for a watch and wait policy and generally\nthis is applied to those unfit for surgery or endoscopic resection (3b-C).\n2.3.3\n|\nQ10 – When is surgery indicated?\nData on nodal risk in very small non-functioning dNETs are scarce.\nSome series report nodal metastases as a common finding in patients\nwith dNET (40%–60%), with tumour size being the most relevant risk\nFIGURE 3\nManagement of duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs).\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n9 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Tumour location\nmay be another important feature to be considered when defining sur-\ngical indication. Lesions arising in the ampullary/periampullary area dif-\nfer from other dNETs due to a more aggressive biological behaviour in\nsome studies57 but not in others.56 Functioning neoplasms harbour a\nhigher metastatic potential.58 Tumour invasion beyond the submucosa,\ntumour grade G2–G3 and lymphovascular invasion are factors affecting\nthe risk of nodal metastases.\nDespite very low grade evidence surgical resection may be indi-\ncated in patients with dNETs showing any of the following features:\n1. Tumour size >10 mm; (some centres may advocate endoscopic\nremoval in 10–15 mm).\n2. Tumour extending beyond the submucosa.\n3. Tumour grade G2–G3.\n4. Lymphovascular invasion.\n5. Functioning neoplasms.\nRegarding the extent of resection, PD (pancreatoduodenectomy)\nand LR (local resection) represent the two main alternatives:\nIn general, pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy is the\nprocedure of choice for ampullary/periampullary neoplasms, due to\ntheir particular aggressiveness. When nodal metastases are pre- or\nintraoperatively identified, PD with nodal dissection is indicated in order\nto obtain a proper oncological clearance. However, for lesions <20 mm,\nless aggressive approaches (i.e., local excision with lymphadenectomy or\npancreas-sparing total duodenectomy) may be considered options. At\nleast eight lymph nodes should be harvested to stage patients accu-\nrately.59 However, radical surgery is associated with a high rate of\nshort- and long-term complications. Therefore, when feasible from an\noncological perspective, other surgical strategies should be considered.\nLocal duodenal resection (i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision\nor enucleation) represents a valuable and safe option, especially for\npatients with non-ampullary, non-functioning, dNET and without sus-\npected nodal involvement at staging,52 (where endoscopic resection is\nnot possible). The role of nodal dissection in this setting is unclear as\nrecent experience does not support the clearance of occult nodal\nmetastases due to lack of association with survival advantages.60\nRecommendations. 1. Surgery is recommended in cases of size >10–\n15 mm and/or tumour extending beyond the\nsubmucosa and/or grade G2-G3 and/or lym-\nphovascular invasion (3-B).\n3\n|\nMANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR\nGASTRIC AND DUODENAL G2–G3\nMETASTATIC NETS\n3.1\n|\nTreatment with curative intent\nDue to the lack of effective systemic therapeutic options surgery\nshould be evaluated even in the presence of metastatic condition\ndepending on the tumour spread and tumour biology if a complete\ntumour resection seems to be possible (R0-resection).\nGastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy includes the removal of\nlocoregional lymph nodes, so the presence of locoregional lymph\nnode metastases should not preclude surgery as a treatment option.\nIn dNET a transduodenal tumour excision with lymph node sampling\nor pancreatoduodenectomy are the treatments of choice.30 The com-\nplete resection of single or multiple liver metastases might be benefi-\ncial even for G3 tumours.61 Thus, surgical resection should be\nevaluated in G2 and in very selected cases of G3-NET depending on\nthe general health condition of the patient. Single or multiple metas-\ntases in other locations should be evaluated for a complete\nresection.\n3.2\n|\nWidespread metastatic disease\nIn the presence of metastases, a systemic therapeutic approach is\nsimilar to that recommended for advanced/unresectable NET from\nother primary sites, owing to the lack of available data in homoge-\nneous series of gastric or duodenal NETs. Somatostatin analogues\nare indicated for NETs G1–G2 with low Ki67 (<10%), and positive\nsomatostatin receptors but can be administered in tumours with\nhigher Ki-67 if slow tumour growth or slow progression are seen.\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid option\ndepending on the receptor status of the tumour. Molecular-\ntargeted therapy with everolimus is a therapeutic option, but with\nlimited\nevidence.62\nIn\nNET\nG3\nchemotherapy\nshould\nbe\nadministered.63\n3.3\n|\nPalliative primary tumour resection\nIn cases of unresectable distant metastases a palliative primary\ntumour resection can be considered rarely to avoid local complica-\ntions. The kind and extent of surgery has to be evaluated depending\non the location of the tumour and possibility of complications of sur-\ngery. A gastrectomy can be necessary in rare cases but a wedge resec-\ntion, distal or subtotal gastric resection should be preferred to reduce\nperioperative\nmorbidity.\nA\ngastric\nbypass\nwithout\ntumour\nre-\nsection should be favoured in case of bulky disease with infiltration of\nthe visceral arteries or pancreas.\n3.4\n|\nLocal recurrence\nIn the presence of local recurrence without diffuse metastatic spread,\noperative resection should be favoured to avoid bleeding or intestinal\nobstruction and to maintain quality of life. Even in the presence of dis-\ntant metastatic spread palliative surgery should be considered to\nensure quality of life depending on the tumour biology and the gen-\neral health status of the patient. Endoscopic procedures such as stent\nor jejunal catheterisation are alternatives for patients with a poor gen-\neral health status.\n10 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\n3.5\n|\nFollow-up\nThe interval for follow-up by contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT\nand/or liver-MRI, 3–12 months, should be based on the malignant\npotential of the tumour.64 Follow-up by additional 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT\nis helpful when the patient's clinical status and the results of CT or\nMRI and biochemistry are discordant. The sensitivity of 68Ga-SSA-\nPET-CT is superior to contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT for\ncharacterisation and detection of lymph node metastases and for visu-\nalisation of metastases to bone and liver,65 and therefore provides\nearlier detection of new lesions. FDG-PET/CT is instead used in G3\ntumours and can also be helpful in high G2 NET when 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT is negative. Re-evaluation of untreated patients should be per-\nformed at 3–6 month intervals.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgery with curative intention of metastatic gastroduodenal NET\nG1/G2/G3 should be performed, if a complete tumour (including\nmetastases) resection seems feasible (4-B).\n2. Palliative surgery (primary resection, bypass) may be indicated in\nmetastatic disease to maintain quality of life (4-C).\n3. The choice of systemic therapy for metastatic gastroduodenal NET\ndepends on tumour grading and includes biotherapy, everolimus,\nPRRT and chemotherapy (4-B).\n4\n|\nCONCLUSIONS\n4.1\n|\nGastric NETs\n1. Evaluation of the type of gNETs by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa is needed.\n2. Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm, whereas a surgical approach should be proposed in\ntumours larger than 2 cm. Tumours between 1 cm and 2 cm in size\nare usually managed by endoscopic resection after EUS evaluation,\nalthough surgery might be indicated in selected cases with G2\ntumours and high Ki-67 (cutoff not established), and in G3\ntumours.\n3. In type III gNETs, a surgical approach is recommended. However,\nin selected patients with small (<1 cm) G1 tumours, endoscopic re-\nsection may be appropriate.\n4.2\n|\nDuodenal NETs\n1. Endoscopic assessment should include tumour location to identify\nperiampullary tumours. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm.\n2. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 may be removed using\nEMR type techniques, whereas larger tumours (>1 cm) and/or\ntumour extending beyond the submucosa and/or grades G2–G3\nand/or lymphovascular invasion and/or functioning neoplasms\nshould be managed by a surgical approach after complete disease\nstaging by dedicated CT, liver-MRI+/\u0003 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4.3\n|\nUnmet needs\n1. The prognostic role of Ki67 in type I gNETs is unclear.\n2. Long-term outcomes of endoscopic resection for both selected\ngastric type 3 NETs, and also duodenal NETs, are lacking.\n3. The risk of progression in low-grade gastroduodenal NETs after\nincomplete R1 endoscopic resection is unknown.\n4. The role of somatostatin analogue treatments in managing type I\ngNETs has not yet been established.\n5. More data are required regarding natural history PPI-induced\ngNETs.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nFrancesco Panzuto: Conceptualization; methodology; supervision;\nwriting – original draft; writing – review and editing.

Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may\nsecrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF\nto functional status.10\nRecommendation\n\u0002 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,\ngrading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and\nsynaptophysin should be reported. SSTR staining or spe-\nciﬁc staining for peptide hormones and amines as well as\nuse of molecular markers is optional and dependent on\nclinical requirements [III, A].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nDisease stage and tumour grade are the two major indepen-\ndent prognostic parameters and should always be assessed\n[III, A]. Since the WHO 2010 classiﬁcation, NENs are graded\nTable 1.

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic\nradical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph\nnodes can be achieved in \u000480% of cases if carried out by\nexperienced surgeons.40\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locore-\ngional\ndisease\nin\nNET\nG1\nand\nG2.\nBefore\nany\nFigure 2.

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].

However, in aggressive NENs (NEC\nG3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy\n(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are\nwarranted.\nMedical therapy\nThe goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-\nassociated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].\nTreatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-\ntide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning\nNETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved\nin 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations\n[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also\nnamed biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in\nNETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the\nmultiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been\nintroduced more recently in the management of NETs.

Most frequently, they are used in\nﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the\nsettings in which they have been studied. Overall response\nrates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48].

The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%). Other side-effects include\nhypertension (26%), lymphopaenia (26%) and hair colour\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.\nThe stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.\nA watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

The NETTER-2 trial has recently been\ninitiated to address this issue (NCT03972488).\nTreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE is in general considered\nsafe, however, up to 3%e4% of the patients may develop\nirreversible bone marrow toxicity such as leukaemia or bone\nmarrow dysplasia. Mild renal toxicity grade 1/2 has been re-\nported long term in 30% of the patients (see Section 5 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline).\nFor more information about PRRT and SSA combination\nand maintenance therapy, see Section 6 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 A surgical approach is indicated in selected patients\naffected by stage IV GEP-NETs who show exclusive or pre-\ndominant liver disease after careful evaluation of tumour\ngrading, distribution of LMs and primary site [IV, B].\n\u0002 Upfront surgery is not indicated in the presence of extra-\nabdominal metastases and high-grade GEP-NENs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Presence of an advanced NEC G3 is considered an abso-\nlute contraindication for an upfront surgery [IV, A].\n\u0002 Palliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV,\nC]. However, it is controversial if primary tumour\nremoval in patients with stage IV disease translates to\nan improvement in survival.\n\u0002 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-\ntoms in patients affected by metastatic functioning\nSI-NETs [IV, B].\n\u0002 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms\nrelated to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery\nmay be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered\nin patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].\n\u0002 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].\n\u0002 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].\nHowever, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy\nwith platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].\n\u0002 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid\noptions for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with\nother systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.\nThe choice of the procedures depends on the local\nexpertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and\nthe localisation of liver involvement [V, C].\n\u0002 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be\napplied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve\ncontrol of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-\ntions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)\n[IV, A].\n\u0002 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,\nlocoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-\ntive to systemic treatment [IV, B].\n\u0002 Systemic therapy should be administered to control\ntumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth\n[I, A].\n\u0002 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients\nwith CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,\nglucagonoma) [I, A].\n\u0002 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-\ntristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-\nment to SSAs [I, A].\n\u0002 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve\nsymptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of\nIFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].\n\u0002 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].\n\u0002 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires\ncareful information to be given to the patient before and\ndirectly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper\ntreatment [IV, A].\n\u0002 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on\npathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth\nbehaviour and SSTR imaging.\n\u0002 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients\nwith low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable\ndisease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term\nfavourable prognosis.\n\u0002 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for\ntumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing\nSSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,\nA; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. Positive SSTR\nstatus is generally required but is not predictive of\nresponse.\n\u0002 IFN-a can be considered for antiproliferative therapy\nif other treatment options have been exploited or\nare not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative on functional\nimaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where there\nare fewer therapy options compared with Pan-NETs\n[IV, B].\n\u0002 Everolimus is EMA-approved for progressive Pan-NET G1/\nG2 with or without prior ChT, for NF-GI and lung NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In GI NETs, everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive disease [I, A].\n\u0002 The use of everolimus after PRRT is recommended in\nintestinal NETs, if PRRT is available [V, A], although the\ntreatment sequence needs to be further studied in the\nabsence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\n\u0002 The combination therapy of SSA and everolimus for an\nantiproliferative purpose is not recommended [II, D].\nM.

Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence.

Type I gNETs are indolent,\nwith negligible risk of metastases (<5%) and excellent long-term sur-\nvival (almost 100%); the prognosis of a patient with type II gNETs\nneeds to be assessed in the context of MEN-I syndrome; however,\nthe risk of metastases may vary between 10% and 30%. Type III\ntumours are usually more aggressive, owing to the high prevalence\nof metastatic disease (>50%) and the more unfavourable long-term\nsurvival (5-year survival rate 70%), although they present well-\ndifferentiated morphology in the majority of cases. Type III gNENs\nmay also have higher grades. The key questions discussed in the pre-\nsent paper are summarised in Table 1. Data were identified by MED-\nLINE database searches and expert opinion/recommendations given\naccording to the best available evidence and the authors’ experi-\nence. Each recommendation for treatment and diagnosis will have a\nlevel of evidence and grade of recommendation as per the GRADE\nsystem (Table S1). The major features of gNETs are summarised in\nTable 2.\n1.2\n|\nAssessment of gastric neuroendocrine\ntumours\n1.2.1\n|\nPathology\nGastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs) are different from other\ngastrointestinal NETs as in the stomach a clear aetiology is emerging\nwhere gastric NETs are induced in the context of hyperplasia of\nenterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. In 1993 an aetiological framework\nfor gastric NETs was reported,2 where gastric NETs were either\nfound in a setting of ECL cell hyperplasia associated with high gas-\ntrin levels due to autoimmune fundic atrophic gastritis (type I NETs),\nhigh gastrin levels due to gastrinoma (type II NETs) or without ECL\nhyperplasia (type III NETs). More recently, general atrophy in chronic\nH. pylori associated gastritis,3 functional failure of parietal cells due\nto mutations4 or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use5 have also been\nreported to be associated with NETs, some with a background of\nECL cell hyperplasia but in cases of proton pump inhibition also\nassociated with parietal cell hyperplasia. These newly described gas-\ntric NETs are similar to the originally described type I gNETs as they\nare secondary to failed acid secretion. The secondary (type I and\ntype II) gNETs have a more indolent course2,5 and can be reversible\nif the cause can be impeded. It is therefore important to recognise\nthe associated gastric mucosal changes.6\nAdequate tumour sampling is essential for grading NETs as pre-\nscribed in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of gas-\ntrointestinal tumours of 2019.7 As NETs are usually located deep in\nthe mucosa (not at the surface) attention should be paid to this when\ntaking biopsies.\nGastric NETs are graded using the same criteria as for all gastroin-\ntestinal sites:8\nG1: mitotic count <2 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index <3% in hotspot\nof at least 500 cells.\nG2: mitotic count between 2 and 20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index\nbetween 3% and 20% in hotspot of at least 500 cells.\nG3: mitotic count >20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20% in hot-\nspot of at least 500 cells.\n1.2.2\n|\nEndoscopy\nThe primary diagnostic tool for gNETs is oesophagogastroduode-\nnoscopy (OGD). For the assessment of gastric NETs, not only rep-\nresentative biopsies of the tumour but also biopsies of the\nsurrounding mucosa and other parts of the stomach (antrum and\nbody-fundus) are essential as these give clues on the nature/\naetiology and, with this, the prognosis and treatment of the NET.\nIn addition, sampling of gastric juice for pH measurement is\nstrongly encouraged. Furthermore, virtual chromoendoscopy (nar-\nrow-band imaging, blue light imaging, i-scan) may be useful to pro-\nvide\nadditional\ninformation\nto\nidentify\nfield\nchanges\nor\nprecancerous lesions in underlying atrophic mucosa.9 In addition\nto OGD, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be performed in all\nlesions >1 cm regardless of type and in all lesions of type III\nregardless of size, unless large or metastatic lesions are found.\nReporting should include size of the lesion infiltration depth and\nassessment of local lymph nodes.\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of gNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to evaluate proliferative activity of the tumour (Ki67\nand/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\nTABLE 1\nList of questions.\nGASTRIC NET\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic resection for type I gNETs?

Evaluation of the type of gNET by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n1.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nBiomarker assessment should include fasting gastrin and chromo-\ngranin A (CgA). Whereas gastrin may be useful to differentiate\nbetween different types (elevated in type I and type II, normal in\ntype III), CgA is only useful as a tumour marker in type III gNETs.\nIn the presence of ongoing PPI therapy gastrin and CgA are not\ndiagnostic and are difficult to interpret. In general, caution should\nbe used when evaluating CgA values, considering the different\ndiagnostic accuracy of available assays. Parietal cell and intrinsic\nfactor antibodies, vitamin B12 and thyroid function parameters\nshould be measured in suspected cases of autoimmune gastritis.\nWhereas type I gNETs do not usually require additional cross-\nsectional imaging, type III gNETs should undergo cross-sectional\nimaging – liver contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nand/or contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography\n(CT), with previous ingestion of water immediately before examina-\ntion, to fill stomach and duodenum and better depict small enhancing\nlesion in the arterial phase, and functional imaging, preferentially\nsomatostatin receptor PET/CT (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT).\nThese should also be considered in cases of type I gNETs with\nmetastases on EUS or high-risk features of metastases (G2, lymphatic\nor vascular invasion, size ≥1 cm). Recently, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT has\nbeen suggested in selected cases with tumour diameter >1 cm, G2\ntumours (perhaps Ki-67 > 10 but exact cutoff not determined), or R1\nmargins after endoscopic resection.10\nPrognosis depends on type, size, grading, histological risk factors\n(e.g., lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion), completeness of\nresection and initial tumour stage.\nRecommendations\n1. Gastrin assessment is useful to differentiate between different\ntypes of gNETs. CgA is useful as tumour marker only in type III\ngNETs (3b-A).\n2. Cross-sectional radiological imaging (CT/MRI) and 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT are not required in type I gNETs, unless metastases on EUS or\nin the presence of high-risk features (G2, vessel invasion, sus-\npected T2 on EUS ) (3b–A).\n1.3\n|\nManagement strategy for type I gNETs\n1.3.1\n|\nIntroduction\nTreatment options for type I gNETs include surveillance, endoscopic\nresection, somatostatin analogues (SSA) and eventually surgery. As\nprognosis is usually quite favourable and tumour growth slow and risk\nof metastases is below 1% in tumours <10 mm, all NET <1 cm can be\nobserved without any need for intervention.11,12 The ideal schedule\nfor observational OGD is not defined and clinical practice ranges from\nevery 6 months to every 2 years. Planning the first follow-up after\n6 months and then every 12 months is the most widely used\napproach. A regular rebiopsy of lesions is not necessary unless atypi-\ncal features (e.g., ulceration, erosion, pitting) appear, suggesting inva-\nsive progression of the lesion. The management of type I gNETs is\nsummarised in Figure 1.\n1.3.2\n|\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic\nresection for type I gNETs? Is additional treatment\nrequired in cases of R1 endoscopic resection?\nEndoscopic resection should be considered for type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm and for those lesions demonstrating increased Ki-67 as\nthese features are associated with an increased risk of metastases and\nprogression.11,13 Many small type I gNETs are G1 or low G2\n(Ki-67 < 10%);14 however, a Ki-67 cutoff has not been defined to\ndetermined when excision should be performed. Endoscopic ultraso-\nnography to determine depth of local invasion and assessment of local\nlymph nodes should be performed in lesions >1 cm and in smaller\ntumours with “high” G2 grade (cutoff not established) before any\nresection. No other imaging modality is required at this stage. The re-\nsection technique of choice depends on size and position of the\nlesion, invasion depth and local experience. Endoscopic mucosal re-\nsection (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and full-\nthickness resection (FTR) are all associated with a low risk profile for\nboth bleeding and perforation. It is not clear which is the best endo-\nscopic technique to be used for achieving a complete R0 resection.15\nHowever, resection by ESD or FTR achieve higher rates of R0 resec-\ntion, but no randomised trials have compared all techniques head-to-\nhead.16,17 For R1 resection status a re-resection in a “step-up”\napproach could be recommended (e.g., ESD after EMR, FTR after\nESD), although data showing risk of local recurrence after R1\nTABLE 2\nDiagnostic criteria and prognosis of gNET subtypes.\nType\nGastric pH\nHistology of surrounding mucosa\nGastrin levels\nGrading\nPrognosis\nI\nHigh\nGastric body atrophy, ECL-cell\nhyperplasia\nHigh\nG1 (G2)\nExcellent: Risk of metastases very low.

Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm (2b-A).\n2. ESD and FTR are more effective to achieve R0 resection compared\nto EMR (2b-B).\n3. In case of incomplete resection (R1) of a NET >1 cm a step-up\napproach (EMR > ESD > FTR > surgery) is recommended (4-C).\n1.3.3\n|\nQ2 – When should somatostatin analogues\nbe used to treat type I gNETs?\nType I gNETs usually express somatostatin receptors. Thus, therapy\nwith SSA can be initiated in metastasised patients or patients not\namenable to endoscopic or surgical resection (e.g., difficult location,\nold age, comorbidities). SSA therapy is associated with a high com-\nplete response rate of 25%–100%, but relapse is frequently observed\nafter discontinuation of therapy.20 Thus, continuous therapy would be\nthe appropriate approach. Another reason for starting SSA therapy\ncould be large tumour size or the requirement of repeated endoscopic\nresection for progressive lesions, although data evaluating this\napproach are lacking. Another therapeutic approach could be direct\ninhibition of gastrin signalling in tumour cells. Indeed, the gastrin\nreceptor\ninhibitor\nnetazepide\nhas\nbeen\nevaluated\nin\na\nproof-\nof-concept phase II trial with 16 patients showing a complete\nresponse rate in 30% of patients.21 Like SSA treatment, tumour\nrelapse after discontinuation was observed in all patients. The clinical\nbenefit of netazepide needs to be evaluated in larger randomised clini-\ncal trials before any recommendation for its use can be formulated.\nRecommendations\n1. In type I gNET patients when tumour resection is indicated but\nendoscopic or surgical techniques are not possible, SSA therapy is\nappropriate (2b-A).\n1.3.4\n|\nQ3 – What is the recommended follow-up\nschedule in type I gNETs?\nAn endoscopic follow-up every 12 months is recommended after\ncomplete endoscopic resection of a type I gNET. Whether this interval\ncan be increased after prolonged periods without evidence of relapse\nor whether the interval should be shortened in case of incomplete\n(R1) resection or risk factors associated with progression (grading G2,\nsize >20 mm) should be carefully discussed with the patient. In gen-\neral, no cross-sectional imaging is required for follow-up. In addition,\nrepeated evaluation of biomarkers CgA and gastrin should not be per-\nformed as these markers are elevated due to the underlying CAG and\nare not an indicator of relapse or progression. Follow-up OGD is\nrecommended in a type I gNET that does not require resection,\nalthough the optimal interval for planning endoscopy is not estab-\nlished\n(1–2 years\ncan\nbe\nconsidered,\nfollowing\nfirst\nfollow-up\n6–12 months after initial diagnosis). Apart from risk of tumour pro-\ngression or relapse after resection in NET lesions, patients with CAG\nFIGURE 1\nManagement of type I gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n4 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Although\nonly one international guideline recommends a regular endoscopic\nfollow-up for patients with CAG, the yearly rate of adenocarcinoma\ndetection is up to 1% in patients with type I gNETs.14 Whether this\nreflects an increased risk of adenocarcinoma development in patients\nwith a previous diagnosis of gNET is not clear. For CAG patients with-\nout a gNET, intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection have been\nlinked to an increased risk of adenocarcinoma progression. Given the\nhigh risk of adenocarcinoma detection upon follow-up of gNETs, this\nsupports the recommendation to perform an endoscopic follow-up\nevery 12–24 months in patients with previously diagnosed gNETs\n(specific timing may be proposed according to tumour size and histo-\nlogical features), whereas a 3-year interval is recommended in CAG\npatients without gNETs.22\nRecommendations\n1. An endoscopic follow-up by OGD is recommended 12 months\nafter complete endoscopic resection of type I gNET (2b-B).\n2. In\nthose\nnot\nrequiring\nresection\nfirst\nfollow-up\nshould\nbe\n12 months and then consider annual to every 1–2 years (2b-B).\n3. In patients with type I gNET, endoscopic follow-up by OGD is\nrecommended also given the risk of developing gastric adenocarci-\nnoma related to CAG (2b-A).\n1.3.5\n|\nQ4 – When is surgery recommended for\ntype I gNETs?\nAlthough type I gNETs are usually treated by an endoscopic approach,\nupfront surgical resection is recommended in all tumours that are\ngreater than 20 mm in size or with suspected muscolaris propria inva-\nsion (either on axial imaging or EUS). In addition, surgery could be\nconsidered in tumours showing high risk features on biopsy (e.g., high\ngrade 2 NET [cutoff not established], lymphovascular invasion). A lim-\nited resection with sampling of local lymph nodes is the preferred\napproach. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy should be\ndiscussed in patients with known lymph node metastases or might be\nproposed as a completion procedure after final histology has proven\nlymphatic spread, although there are no solid data supporting this\noption.\nEndoscopic resection should not be attempted in the presence of\ninvasion into the muscularis propria, suspected lymph node metasta-\nses or high-risk features of metastatic spread (e.g., high Ki-67, vascular\ninvasion, size >20 mm). These patients should receive full staging\nincluding cross-sectional imaging as described previously and 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT and upfront surgical management. The optimal cutoff\nvalue for Ki-67 is not determined, but Ki-67 values above 10% should\ntrigger evaluation of surgical treatment. In the rare instance of a G3\ntype I gNET a primarily surgical approach is recommended due to high\nrisk of metastases.23 Regarding tumour size, no clear cutoff for surgi-\ncal management can be defined. Only limited data exist on tumour\nsize and risk of metastases in the subgroup of type I gNETs. Data from\nthe SEER database and from a large series from Taiwan showed that a\ncutoff of 20 mm was associated with an increased risk of lymph node\nmetastases.13,24\nIn case of incomplete endoscopic resection (R1) or risk features in\nfinal pathology after endoscopic resection, a surgical approach should\nbe discussed with the patient to achieve R0 resection and/or re-\nsection of local lymph nodes to exclude metastatic spread. In cases of\nlesions not amenable to an endoscopic approach (e.g., location close\nto cardia) a primary surgical resection might be necessary.\nSSA treatment to reduce gastrin production, thus diminishing the\nstimulus for further tumour growth and progression, could be pro-\nposed in patients who could not undergo resection or for multiple\nlarger tumours or frequent relapse. Antrectomy should no longer be\nroutinely offered but might be an option in patients not tolerating\nSSA or declining continuous application.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgical approach is recommended in tumours >20 mm or with\nsuspected muscolaris propria invasion (either on axial imaging or\nEUS). In addition, surgery could be considered (in tumours show-\ning high risk features on biopsies (high Ki-67, lymphovascular inva-\nsion) (2b-A).\n2. Limited resection with local nodal sampling is the preferred surgical\nstrategy (3b-A).\n3. Gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy (specific kind of re-\nsection according with the tumour site) should be discussed in\npatients with known lymph node metastases or might be proposed\nas a completion procedure after final histology has proven lym-\nphatic spread after full exploration with cross sectional imaging\n(3b-A).\n1.4\n|\nType II gNETs\nType II gNETs are the rarest type of gNET (5% of cases). They arise in\nthe context of hypergastrinaemia associated with ZES which may\noccur in patients with MEN-I.

However, with the widespread\nuse of high-definition endoscopy, type III gNETs of smaller size and\nlower grade are increasingly being detected. A recent systematic\nreview of 147 type III gNENs in which tumour management was\nreported found that \u000145% were G1, 35% were G2 and 20% were\nG3.26 As a result, less invasive treatment options, ranging from endo-\nscopic resection to surgical wedge resection, have been investigated\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n5 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

The management of type III gNETs is sum-\nmarised in Figure 2.\n1.5.2\n|\nQ5 – Can endoscopic treatments be\nproposed to treat type III gNETs?\nType III gNETs should be carefully characterised using endoscopy,\nbiopsy, cross sectional thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI, and often\nfunctional imaging (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT or FDG/PET-CT depending on\ntumour grade) and in most cases EUS. Evidence from several retro-\nspective\ncase\nseries\nsuggests\nthat\ncarefully\nselected\npatients\nwho have no evidence of lymph node involvement can be safely and\nsuccessfully\nmanaged\nby\nendoscopic\nresection.\nEndoscopic\nre-\nsection appears to be most appropriate in patients who have localised\nG1 tumours ≤10 mm in diameter, because tumours greater than this\nsize are more likely to have lymph node metastases (even though\nthese may not be detected by imaging techniques).26,27 However\nendoscopic resection can also be considered in patients with slightly\nlarger tumours (<15 mm) and low G2 (Ki-67 3–10%) histology, partic-\nularly if the risks of surgical resection are considered to be high.26\nCurrent evidence does not support the use of a particular endoscopic\nresection technique (EMR vs. ESD).26 Some very small (<5 mm)\ntumours have also been unintentionally removed by avulsion biopsy\nwith no evidence of subsequent tumour recurrence, but this approach\nis\nnot\ngenerally\nrecommended.26\nPatients\nwith\npositive\nre-\nsection margins (R1) should be considered for additional endoscopic\nresection or surgical salvage if appropriate. Patients who have under-\ngone endoscopic resection should have close follow up with endos-\ncopy and imaging (thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI) to detect local\nand distant tumour recurrence.\nRecommendations\n1. Endoscopic resection may be considered in patients who have\nlocalised type III G1 gNETs ≤10 mm, and occasionally larger\ntumours with Ki-67 <10% and <15 mm in diameter if the risks of\nsurgical\nresection\nare\nhigh\nprovided\nadequate\nstaging\nis\nallowed (3a–C).\n1.5.3\n|\nQ6 – When should limited or extended\nsurgical treatments be proposed to treat type III\ngNETs?\nSeveral clinicopathological features should be carefully evaluated to\nidentify the best surgical option (limited vs. extended resection) for\npatients with type III gNETs.\nA limited gastric wedge resection without standard lymphade-\nnectomy can be considered as treatment option in patients with loca-\nlised, G1 type III gNETs with no evidence of lymph node involvement\non preoperative imaging (including EUS).26 In patients fulfilling the\nabove-mentioned criteria, tumour size, depth of infiltration and pres-\nence of lymphovascular invasion should be further assessed to define\nthe extent of surgical resection. Therefore, a wedge resection can be\nsafely proposed to patients with G1 type III gNETs <20 mm, limited to\nthe submucosal layer and with no evidence of lymphovascular inva-\nsion.26,28 The role of wedge resections in patients with G2 type III gNETs\nremains debated, as tumour grade represents a powerful predictor of dis-\nease aggressiveness. Similarly, the tumour size cutoff for proposing lim-\nited surgical resection is not clearly defined. Type III gNETs <10 mm are\nusually managed with endoscopic resection, whereas a limited surgical re-\nsection might be considered as initial treatment option for lesions measur-\ning >10 mm and <20 mm.26 Recent experiences report favourable\nFIGURE 2\nManagement of type III gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n6 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Radical surgery is recommended as second-line treatment\nwhen final histology reveals one or more of the following findings: pres-\nence of nodal metastases, higher tumour grade compared with original\nbiopsy, lymphovascular invasion or lack of complete tumour clearance\n(R1), in patients initially managed with a limited wedge resection.26\nRecommendations\n1. A limited wedge resection with local nodal sampling (without standard\nlymphadenectomy) can be considered as a treatment option in patients\nwith localised, G1–G2 type III gNETs, with no evidence of lymphade-\nnopathy on full staging preoperative imaging (including EUS) (2b-B).\n2. Radical surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is recommended in\ntype III gNETs when nodal metastases are found/suspected on preop-\nerative staging, if Ki67 >20% or tumour diameter >20 mm (2b-B).\n1.5.4\n|\nQ7 – What scheduled follow-up is\nrecommended after endoscopic/surgical resection of\ntype III gNETs?\nFollow-up of patients who underwent surgical resection of type III\ngNETs is based on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging (thora-\ncoabdominal CT/liver-MRI with sometimes OGD and/or EUS or func-\ntional imaging [68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and/or FDG-PET/CT depending on\nthe tumour grade]). The timing of follow-up has never been clearly\ndefined. When a total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is per-\nformed, the follow-up schedule adopted for gastric adenocarcinoma\nshould be applied.26 On the other hand, patients managed conserva-\ntively (endoscopic or surgical local excision) should undergo OGD\nafter about 3 months to check the resection site and if this shows no\nmacroscopic residual tumour, they should have regular follow-up with\ncross-sectional imaging and endoscopy/EUS. The frequency and\nchoice of test will be influenced by the final tumour size and grade as\nwell as patient fitness and in most cases, it will be possible to reduce\nthe frequency of follow up as time progresses after resection. 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT (or FDG-PET/CT depending on the tumour grade) and\nbiopsies should be performed in the presence of a suspected disease\nrelapse, but they are not routinely part of the follow-up programme.30\nRecommendations\n1. Radiological follow-up by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recom-\nmended in patients treated by surgical resection for type III gNETs (5-A).\n2\n|\nDUODENAL NEUROENDOCRINE\nTUMOURS\n2.1\n|\nIntroduction – general background\nLike gNETs, duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs) are rare\ntumours but also with an increasing incidence found mostly at OGD\nor axial imaging for other reasons (incidental discovery) but also can\nbe found as primaries at workup for patients with stage 4 diseases or\nmore rarely as part of inherited syndromes such as MEN-I and neuro-\nfibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Most dNETs are non-functional tumours,\nbut duodenal tumours secreting gastrin are not infrequent (either spo-\nradic or as part of MEN-I) and more rarely tumours secreting somato-\nstatin (so called somatostatinomas) (see Guidance paper on functional\npancreatic NETs).\nThe overall incidence of dNETs is low accounting for only 2.8% of\nall NETs.31,32 The annual age adjusted incidence for dNET has been\nreported to be 0.19 per 100,000.32 Traditionally, dNETs have been\nclassified into non-functioning (approximately 90% of lesions) or func-\ntioning tumours (those secreting specific peptides of hormones elicit-\ning a functional clinical consequence or syndrome)33 and can be\nsummarised as:\n1. Non-functioning dNETs (they can secrete peptides and substances\nnot resulting in a clinical condition or syndrome).\n2. Duodenal composite gangliocytoma/neuroma and neuroendocrine\ntumour (CogNET) (previously known as gangliocytic paragan-\nglioma), occurs almost exclusively in the second part of the duode-\nnum and periampullary region and is considered a composite\ntumour of epithelial NETs and ganglioneuroma.34\n3. Duodenal gastrinoma (gastrin secreting and either sporadic or part\nof MEN-I where duodenal localisation is very frequent) and soma-\ntostatinomas (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance\npaper on functioning pancreatic NETs).\n4. Duodenal NEC (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance\npaper for digestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).\n2.2\n|\nAssessment of dNETs\n2.2.1\n|\nPathology\nPathological assessment and grading of dNETs is like that of NETs of\nall other sites. Adequate sampling is needed and the deep mucosal\nlocation of these lesions, usually suspected by the endoscopist due to\nthe smooth surface as opposed to the more common adenomas and\ncarcinomas of the duodenum, warrants an attempt to perform deep\nbiopsies. Morphologically, the main differential diagnosis in the duo-\ndenum is the CoGNET, previously classified as a ganglioneuroma or\nparaganglioma, but now shown to be more similar to NETs.36,37\nIn cases with a high proliferation rate (i.e., mitotic count >20 in\n2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20%), NEC and adenocarcinoma with\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n7 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nneuroendocrine features should be ruled out (see guidance paper for\ndigestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).\n2.2.2\n|\nEndoscopy\nMost dNETs are in the first or second part of the duodenum.38 Symp-\ntoms range from mostly none at incidental discovery to symptoms\nattributed to gastric outlet obstruction (in rare cases of large lesions)\nor anaemia. Patients with dNETs close to the ampulla and CoGNET\nwhich occur in the periampullary region can present with gastrointes-\ntinal bleeding, abdominal pain, anaemia or jaundice.38,39 Periampullary\ndNETs are not infrequent in patients with neurofibromatosis type\n1 (NF1), also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease including\nsomatostatinomas.40,41\nAt OGD, dNETs have similar features to gNETs but are typically\nsingle small sessile, erythematous or pale lesions in the duodenal cap,\nbulb or D1 to D2.6 In recent years, increasingly smaller lesions have\nbeen detected, owing to the better mucosal visualisation with modern\nendoscopic tools. The reported mean size of dNETs varies between\n7 mm and 1.5 cm.42 Up to 10% of dNETs can occur as multiple\ntumours, which should prompt a diagnosis of MEN-I. It has been\nreported that approximately a quarter to a third of patients with\ndNETs and ZES, have undiagnosed MEN-I.43,44\nEndoscopic characterisation of dNETs has been described by Bor-\nbath and colleagues.6 Diagnosis is usually confirmed at endoscopic\nforceps biopsy (care as very small lesions may be almost completely\nexcised at biopsy sampling and making future identification hard in\ncase of R1 resection). Tumours of 1 cm or above should have accurate\nlocal staging by EUS as regional lymph node metastases occur in up to\n40%–60% of cases, especially in duodenal gastrinomas.43,45,46\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of dNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate proliferative activ-\nity of the tumour (Ki-67 and/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\n2. Endoscopic assessment of dNETs should include tumour location\nto identify periampullary tumours (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n2.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nDuodenal NETs are generally diagnosed by endoscopy and endoscopic\nultrasound. Computed tomography after ingestion of water to fill stom-\nach and duodenum, is recommended to help preoperative exploration.\nCT-enterography, MRI, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and 18F-DOPA-PET/CT are\nnot sufficiently accurate for localisation of well-differentiated gastrodu-\nodenal primary tumours,47–49 but these examinations are used to help\nstaging of regional and distant metastases.50\nLaboratory tests are required for patients newly diagnosed with\ndNET. It is especially important to recognise potential gastrinoma\n(serum gastrin, chromogranin and occasionally secretin testing). Other\nlaboratory tests, if symptoms are suggestive, may include somato-\nstatin, and very rarely growth hormone releasing factor and cortisol\nwith urinary 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid.38 If a diagnosis of genetic syn-\ndrome is suspected (e.g., MEN-I or NF1) specific laboratory tests and\ngermline testing is advised38,51 Distinguishing between dNET and\nneurofibromas may be difficult in some cases especially on axial\nimaging.\nRecommendations\n1. Locoregional and distant staging examiner actions for dNETs\ninclude contrast-enhanced CT (with water ingestion), liver -MRI\nand 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT (3b-B).\n2. Ruling out gastrinoma and screening for genetic syndromes when\nappropriate should be considered for dNETs (3b-B).\n2.3\n|\nManagement strategy for dNETs\nFactors that need to be considered prior to endoscopic resection of\ndNET are:\n1. Size of tumour (commonly estimated at EUS and OGD).\n2. Depth of invasion in relation to the deep muscle layer (estimated\nat EUS).\n3. Any evidence of lymphadenopathy and/or metastatic spread on\nEUS, liver-MRI, thoracoabdominal CT and functional imaging, pref-\nerably 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4. Grade and morphology of tumour (determined by endoscopy, EUS\nand endoscopic biopsy).\n5. Endoscopic\nappearance:\ncentral\ndepression/ulceration\nimplies\ninvasion.\n6. Suitability for endoscopic resection: size of lesion/endoscopic\naccess/location of lesion/proximity to ampulla.\n7. Hormone secretion status.\n8. Patient age and performance status.\nSize of the lesion is not a definitive guide to the correct treat-\nment. Treatment options are: endoscopic surveillance, endoscopic re-\nsection (by EMR/ESD/underwater EMR/over the scope clip), local\nduodenal resection (LR) or pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). The out-\ncomes may be related to the factors of the tumour at presentation\nrather than the type of resection procedure.52 The management of\ndNETs is summarised in Figure 3.\nWhen defining surgical indications for dNET, several key points\nshould be considered (see section 8.3).\n2.3.1\n|\nQ8 – When is endoscopic\nresection indicated?\nVery small non-functioning lesions 5 mm or less in D1 are commonly\nremoved after lifting injection and snare (or by diagnostic biopsy)\nbefore any histological diagnosis is made and these lesions do not\nusually recur or metastasise.\n8 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nFor younger and fitter patients who have lesions of 5–10 mm\n(and up to 15 mm in some centres), an opinion should be sought\nfrom therapeutic endoscopy about resection and the associated\nrisks. EUS should be performed as well as axial and functional imag-\ning. Most of these lesions are grade 1 and not invading the muscle\nlayer.\nIn\nthese\ncircumstances\nan\nendoscopic\nresection\nusing\nEMR/Cap EMR/ESD is reasonable, but risks of perforation are signif-\nicant, especially in D2. If endoscopic therapy is high risk (published\nrates of perforation 15%–25%) or unlikely to be curative, LR\n(i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision or enucleation) or pancrea-\ntoduodenectomy (PD) (if considered essential by the surgeon) should\nbe considered. Endoscopic therapy combined with laparoscopy for\nrescue in the event of perforation has been performed which may\nrepresent a novel and valuable alternative to ESD, able to guarantee\na\nhigh\nR0\nrate\nand\na\nlow\nrisk\nof\nintraoperative\nduodenal\nperforation.53\nDuodenal NETs can be multiple, particularly if they are gas-\ntrinomas, and an association with MEN-I exists. Somatostatino-\nmas\ncan\nalso\noccur\nin\nthe\nduodenum,\noften\nclose\nto\nthe\nampulla, but generally are without a clinical syndrome. There is\nan\nassociation\nwith\nNF1\n(functioning\ntumours\nare\nbeing\naddressed in a separate guidance paper on pancreatic func-\ntional NETs).\nRecommendations\n1. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 should be removed\nusing EMR type techniques (3b-C).\n2. Lesions of 5–10 mm (and up to 15 mm in some centres) can be\nremoved endoscopically after imaging work-up, but risks are rela-\ntively high (3b-C).\n2.3.2\n|\nQ9 – Can a “watch and wait” strategy be\nproposed in dNETs?\nA watch and wait policy could be considered for very small (<5 mm)\ndNETs that cannot easily be resected, are non-functional, G1 and not\ninvading the muscularis propria. This policy has usually been applied in\npatients unfit for endoscopic resection or surgery, since a more defini-\ntive therapy would be recommended in most cases, although a watch\nand wait policy has more recently been recommended as a result from\nsome small series with limited follow-up. It is not clear if watch and\nwait is a suitable option in a patient who is fit for resection.54,55\nRecommendations\nThere is very limited evidence for a watch and wait policy and generally\nthis is applied to those unfit for surgery or endoscopic resection (3b-C).\n2.3.3\n|\nQ10 – When is surgery indicated?\nData on nodal risk in very small non-functioning dNETs are scarce.\nSome series report nodal metastases as a common finding in patients\nwith dNET (40%–60%), with tumour size being the most relevant risk\nFIGURE 3\nManagement of duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs).\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n9 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Tumour location\nmay be another important feature to be considered when defining sur-\ngical indication. Lesions arising in the ampullary/periampullary area dif-\nfer from other dNETs due to a more aggressive biological behaviour in\nsome studies57 but not in others.56 Functioning neoplasms harbour a\nhigher metastatic potential.58 Tumour invasion beyond the submucosa,\ntumour grade G2–G3 and lymphovascular invasion are factors affecting\nthe risk of nodal metastases.\nDespite very low grade evidence surgical resection may be indi-\ncated in patients with dNETs showing any of the following features:\n1. Tumour size >10 mm; (some centres may advocate endoscopic\nremoval in 10–15 mm).\n2. Tumour extending beyond the submucosa.\n3. Tumour grade G2–G3.\n4. Lymphovascular invasion.\n5. Functioning neoplasms.\nRegarding the extent of resection, PD (pancreatoduodenectomy)\nand LR (local resection) represent the two main alternatives:\nIn general, pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy is the\nprocedure of choice for ampullary/periampullary neoplasms, due to\ntheir particular aggressiveness. When nodal metastases are pre- or\nintraoperatively identified, PD with nodal dissection is indicated in order\nto obtain a proper oncological clearance. However, for lesions <20 mm,\nless aggressive approaches (i.e., local excision with lymphadenectomy or\npancreas-sparing total duodenectomy) may be considered options. At\nleast eight lymph nodes should be harvested to stage patients accu-\nrately.59 However, radical surgery is associated with a high rate of\nshort- and long-term complications. Therefore, when feasible from an\noncological perspective, other surgical strategies should be considered.\nLocal duodenal resection (i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision\nor enucleation) represents a valuable and safe option, especially for\npatients with non-ampullary, non-functioning, dNET and without sus-\npected nodal involvement at staging,52 (where endoscopic resection is\nnot possible). The role of nodal dissection in this setting is unclear as\nrecent experience does not support the clearance of occult nodal\nmetastases due to lack of association with survival advantages.60\nRecommendations. 1. Surgery is recommended in cases of size >10–\n15 mm and/or tumour extending beyond the\nsubmucosa and/or grade G2-G3 and/or lym-\nphovascular invasion (3-B).\n3\n|\nMANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR\nGASTRIC AND DUODENAL G2–G3\nMETASTATIC NETS\n3.1\n|\nTreatment with curative intent\nDue to the lack of effective systemic therapeutic options surgery\nshould be evaluated even in the presence of metastatic condition\ndepending on the tumour spread and tumour biology if a complete\ntumour resection seems to be possible (R0-resection).\nGastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy includes the removal of\nlocoregional lymph nodes, so the presence of locoregional lymph\nnode metastases should not preclude surgery as a treatment option.\nIn dNET a transduodenal tumour excision with lymph node sampling\nor pancreatoduodenectomy are the treatments of choice.30 The com-\nplete resection of single or multiple liver metastases might be benefi-\ncial even for G3 tumours.61 Thus, surgical resection should be\nevaluated in G2 and in very selected cases of G3-NET depending on\nthe general health condition of the patient. Single or multiple metas-\ntases in other locations should be evaluated for a complete\nresection.\n3.2\n|\nWidespread metastatic disease\nIn the presence of metastases, a systemic therapeutic approach is\nsimilar to that recommended for advanced/unresectable NET from\nother primary sites, owing to the lack of available data in homoge-\nneous series of gastric or duodenal NETs. Somatostatin analogues\nare indicated for NETs G1–G2 with low Ki67 (<10%), and positive\nsomatostatin receptors but can be administered in tumours with\nhigher Ki-67 if slow tumour growth or slow progression are seen.\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid option\ndepending on the receptor status of the tumour. Molecular-\ntargeted therapy with everolimus is a therapeutic option, but with\nlimited\nevidence.62\nIn\nNET\nG3\nchemotherapy\nshould\nbe\nadministered.63\n3.3\n|\nPalliative primary tumour resection\nIn cases of unresectable distant metastases a palliative primary\ntumour resection can be considered rarely to avoid local complica-\ntions. The kind and extent of surgery has to be evaluated depending\non the location of the tumour and possibility of complications of sur-\ngery. A gastrectomy can be necessary in rare cases but a wedge resec-\ntion, distal or subtotal gastric resection should be preferred to reduce\nperioperative\nmorbidity.\nA\ngastric\nbypass\nwithout\ntumour\nre-\nsection should be favoured in case of bulky disease with infiltration of\nthe visceral arteries or pancreas.\n3.4\n|\nLocal recurrence\nIn the presence of local recurrence without diffuse metastatic spread,\noperative resection should be favoured to avoid bleeding or intestinal\nobstruction and to maintain quality of life. Even in the presence of dis-\ntant metastatic spread palliative surgery should be considered to\nensure quality of life depending on the tumour biology and the gen-\neral health status of the patient. Endoscopic procedures such as stent\nor jejunal catheterisation are alternatives for patients with a poor gen-\neral health status.\n10 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

The sensitivity of 68Ga-SSA-\nPET-CT is superior to contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT for\ncharacterisation and detection of lymph node metastases and for visu-\nalisation of metastases to bone and liver,65 and therefore provides\nearlier detection of new lesions. FDG-PET/CT is instead used in G3\ntumours and can also be helpful in high G2 NET when 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT is negative. Re-evaluation of untreated patients should be per-\nformed at 3–6 month intervals.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgery with curative intention of metastatic gastroduodenal NET\nG1/G2/G3 should be performed, if a complete tumour (including\nmetastases) resection seems feasible (4-B).\n2. Palliative surgery (primary resection, bypass) may be indicated in\nmetastatic disease to maintain quality of life (4-C).\n3. The choice of systemic therapy for metastatic gastroduodenal NET\ndepends on tumour grading and includes biotherapy, everolimus,\nPRRT and chemotherapy (4-B).\n4\n|\nCONCLUSIONS\n4.1\n|\nGastric NETs\n1. Evaluation of the type of gNETs by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa is needed.\n2. Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm, whereas a surgical approach should be proposed in\ntumours larger than 2 cm. Tumours between 1 cm and 2 cm in size\nare usually managed by endoscopic resection after EUS evaluation,\nalthough surgery might be indicated in selected cases with G2\ntumours and high Ki-67 (cutoff not established), and in G3\ntumours.\n3. In type III gNETs, a surgical approach is recommended. However,\nin selected patients with small (<1 cm) G1 tumours, endoscopic re-\nsection may be appropriate.\n4.2\n|\nDuodenal NETs\n1. Endoscopic assessment should include tumour location to identify\nperiampullary tumours. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm.\n2. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 may be removed using\nEMR type techniques, whereas larger tumours (>1 cm) and/or\ntumour extending beyond the submucosa and/or grades G2–G3\nand/or lymphovascular invasion and/or functioning neoplasms\nshould be managed by a surgical approach after complete disease\nstaging by dedicated CT, liver-MRI+/\u0003 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4.3\n|\nUnmet needs\n1. The prognostic role of Ki67 in type I gNETs is unclear.\n2. Long-term outcomes of endoscopic resection for both selected\ngastric type 3 NETs, and also duodenal NETs, are lacking.\n3. The risk of progression in low-grade gastroduodenal NETs after\nincomplete R1 endoscopic resection is unknown.\n4. The role of somatostatin analogue treatments in managing type I\ngNETs has not yet been established.\n5. More data are required regarding natural history PPI-induced\ngNETs.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nFrancesco Panzuto: Conceptualization; methodology; supervision;\nwriting – original draft; writing – review and editing.

Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may\nsecrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF\nto functional status.10\nRecommendation\n\u0002 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,\ngrading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and\nsynaptophysin should be reported. SSTR staining or spe-\nciﬁc staining for peptide hormones and amines as well as\nuse of molecular markers is optional and dependent on\nclinical requirements [III, A].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nDisease stage and tumour grade are the two major indepen-\ndent prognostic parameters and should always be assessed\n[III, A]. Since the WHO 2010 classiﬁcation, NENs are graded\nTable 1.

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs. FDG is the tracer of choice\nfor G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose\nmetabolism and less SSTR expression than the low-grade\nNETs, for which the situation is usually the reverse.29 Com-\nbined SSTR imaging and FDG-PET-CT has been shown to be\ncomplementary for lesion detection. Findings of FDG-\npositive NETs at PET-CT indicate worse prognosis.29e31\nThe author panel believes that optimal diagnostic and\nprognostic information can be achieved by submitting all\nNET G2/G3 patients to PET-CT with both FDG and 68Ga-\nTable 3.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B].

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C]. Combining resection and radio-\nfrequency ablation (RFA) may provide the opportunity to\nachieve complete tumour removal, allowing more limited\nM.

However, in aggressive NENs (NEC\nG3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy\n(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are\nwarranted.\nMedical therapy\nThe goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-\nassociated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].\nTreatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-\ntide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning\nNETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved\nin 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations\n[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also\nnamed biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in\nNETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the\nmultiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been\nintroduced more recently in the management of NETs.

SSAs are an established anti-\nproliferative therapy in metastatic GEP-NETs, based on two\nplacebo-controlled trials. Most frequently, they are used in\nﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the\nsettings in which they have been studied. Overall response\nrates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset. The\nmedian progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached\nwith lanreotide (>27 months) and was 18 months in the\nplacebo arm.59 The CLARINET extension study also showed\nefﬁcacy in\nprogressive\ndisease\npatients with\nentero-\npancreatic NETs.60 There is very good long-term tolerability\nof both SSAs.47,58,59 SSAs can be recommended for tumour\ngrowth control in advanced SSTR-positive, slowly-growing\nGI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I, A; European Society\nfor Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A; ESMO-\nMCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48]. There was a beneﬁt in terms of PFS prolon-\ngation in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56 (0.37e0.8)] and the\nlung NET subgroup [HR 0.5 (0.28e0.88)], and everolimus is\nEMA-approved for NF-GI and lung NETs. Everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive GI NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%).

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.\nThe stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.\nA watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

In\npatients with a Ki-67 of >35%, mPFS was 6.8 months in one\nstudy,101 and in patient subgroups with Ki-67 >55%, mPFS\nwas 6 months, 4 months and 4 months, respectively from\nthe different studies.99,100,102 PRRT may be considered in\npatients with NET G3 [IV, C], however, patients need to be\ncarefully selected and prospective trials are warranted to\nfurther establish which patients with NEN G3 might beneﬁt\nmost from PRRT. The NETTER-2 trial has recently been\ninitiated to address this issue (NCT03972488).\nTreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE is in general considered\nsafe, however, up to 3%e4% of the patients may develop\nirreversible bone marrow toxicity such as leukaemia or bone\nmarrow dysplasia. Mild renal toxicity grade 1/2 has been re-\nported long term in 30% of the patients (see Section 5 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline).\nFor more information about PRRT and SSA combination\nand maintenance therapy, see Section 6 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 A surgical approach is indicated in selected patients\naffected by stage IV GEP-NETs who show exclusive or pre-\ndominant liver disease after careful evaluation of tumour\ngrading, distribution of LMs and primary site [IV, B].\n\u0002 Upfront surgery is not indicated in the presence of extra-\nabdominal metastases and high-grade GEP-NENs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Presence of an advanced NEC G3 is considered an abso-\nlute contraindication for an upfront surgery [IV, A].\n\u0002 Palliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV,\nC]. However, it is controversial if primary tumour\nremoval in patients with stage IV disease translates to\nan improvement in survival.\n\u0002 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-\ntoms in patients affected by metastatic functioning\nSI-NETs [IV, B].\n\u0002 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms\nrelated to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery\nmay be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered\nin patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].\n\u0002 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].\n\u0002 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].\nHowever, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy\nwith platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].\n\u0002 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid\noptions for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with\nother systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.\nThe choice of the procedures depends on the local\nexpertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and\nthe localisation of liver involvement [V, C].\n\u0002 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be\napplied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve\ncontrol of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-\ntions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)\n[IV, A].\n\u0002 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,\nlocoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-\ntive to systemic treatment [IV, B].\n\u0002 Systemic therapy should be administered to control\ntumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth\n[I, A].\n\u0002 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients\nwith CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,\nglucagonoma) [I, A].\n\u0002 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-\ntristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-\nment to SSAs [I, A].\n\u0002 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve\nsymptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of\nIFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].\n\u0002 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].\n\u0002 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires\ncareful information to be given to the patient before and\ndirectly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper\ntreatment [IV, A].\n\u0002 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on\npathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth\nbehaviour and SSTR imaging.\n\u0002 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients\nwith low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable\ndisease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term\nfavourable prognosis.\n\u0002 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for\ntumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing\nSSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,\nA; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. Positive SSTR\nstatus is generally required but is not predictive of\nresponse.\n\u0002 IFN-a can be considered for antiproliferative therapy\nif other treatment options have been exploited or\nare not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative on functional\nimaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where there\nare fewer therapy options compared with Pan-NETs\n[IV, B].\n\u0002 Everolimus is EMA-approved for progressive Pan-NET G1/\nG2 with or without prior ChT, for NF-GI and lung NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In GI NETs, everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive disease [I, A].\n\u0002 The use of everolimus after PRRT is recommended in\nintestinal NETs, if PRRT is available [V, A], although the\ntreatment sequence needs to be further studied in the\nabsence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\n\u0002 The combination therapy of SSA and everolimus for an\nantiproliferative purpose is not recommended [II, D].\nM.

There is\nno established second-line therapy, but different\nregimens [e.g. 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI),\n5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin\n(FOLFOX),\nCAPTEM\n\u0006\nbevacizumab] may be considered [IV, B].\n\u0002 In NET G3, response rates to cisplatin/etoposide are\nlow, and the use of this combination is not recommen-\nded [IV, C].\n\u0002 ChT cannot be recommended in well-differentiated\nslowly growing NETs of the GI tract [II, C]; exceptions\nmay be rapidly progressive tumours or NET G2 with\nhigher Ki-67 close to NET G3 [V, C].\n\u0002 PRRT is recommended as second-line therapy in patients\nwith midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs who\nfulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT [I, A].\n\u0002 177Lu-DOTATATE is EMA- and FDA-approved for patients\nwith midgut NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] and\nPan-NETs [III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4].\n\u0002 In Pan-NETs, PRRT should be used after failure of\napproved therapies [III, A].\n\u0002 In carefully selected patients, PRRT may be considered in\nNET G3 [IV, C].\n\u0002 SSA should be combined with PRRT in patients with\nfunctioning tumours (CS) to prevent increasing symp-\ntoms such as diarrhoea and/or ﬂushing and hormonal\ncrisis soon after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 It is also common practice to continue SSA beyond PRRT\nin functioning tumours, as a full resolution of CS-related\nsymptoms is rarely achieved after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 The combination of SSA with PRRT is not recommended\nin patients with NF-NETs, [IV, C] and it remains unclear if\nSSA should be continued after PRRT as a maintenance\ntherapy.\nPERSONALISED MEDICINE\nIn the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity of\ncomparative\nrandomised\ntrials,\ntherapy\nselection\nin\nadvanced non-resectable disease is frequently based on\nindividual patient clinical and pathological features and\nSSTR imaging [IV, A]. Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence. NSE and\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be monitored in NEC;\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Conventional imaging\nincludes thoracic and abdominal scans every 2e3 months.\nFDG-PET may be required in case of suspected recurrence to\ndiscriminate lesions from unspeciﬁc ﬁndings; otherwise,\nhigh-resolution CT is the imaging method of choice, unless\nresection is considered in locally advanced NEN G3,\nwhere FDG-PET is mandatory to exclude distant metastatic\ndisease.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional\nand SSTR imaging [V, B].\n\u0002 In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1eG2, it is recom-\nmended that imaging is carried out every 3e6 months\n(CT or MRI), and in NEC G3 every 2e3 months [V, C].\nSimilar staging intervals apply to advanced disease.\n\u0002 Follow-up should be lifelong, although the staging inter-\nvals may be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up.\n\u0002 Small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix or rectum do not need any follow-up if\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in\naccordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures\nfor Clinical Practice Guidelines development, http://www.\nesmo.org/Guidelines/ESMOGuidelines-Methodology.\nThe\nrelevant literature has been selected by the expert authors.\nAn ESMO-MCBS table with ESMO-MCBS scores is included\nin supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.107 Levels of evidence and grades of recommenda-\ntion have been applied using the system shown in\nsupplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.108 Statements without grading were considered\njustiﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts and the\nESMO Faculty.

Type I gNETs are indolent,\nwith negligible risk of metastases (<5%) and excellent long-term sur-\nvival (almost 100%); the prognosis of a patient with type II gNETs\nneeds to be assessed in the context of MEN-I syndrome; however,\nthe risk of metastases may vary between 10% and 30%. Type III\ntumours are usually more aggressive, owing to the high prevalence\nof metastatic disease (>50%) and the more unfavourable long-term\nsurvival (5-year survival rate 70%), although they present well-\ndifferentiated morphology in the majority of cases. Type III gNENs\nmay also have higher grades. The key questions discussed in the pre-\nsent paper are summarised in Table 1. Data were identified by MED-\nLINE database searches and expert opinion/recommendations given\naccording to the best available evidence and the authors’ experi-\nence. Each recommendation for treatment and diagnosis will have a\nlevel of evidence and grade of recommendation as per the GRADE\nsystem (Table S1). The major features of gNETs are summarised in\nTable 2.\n1.2\n|\nAssessment of gastric neuroendocrine\ntumours\n1.2.1\n|\nPathology\nGastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs) are different from other\ngastrointestinal NETs as in the stomach a clear aetiology is emerging\nwhere gastric NETs are induced in the context of hyperplasia of\nenterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells. In 1993 an aetiological framework\nfor gastric NETs was reported,2 where gastric NETs were either\nfound in a setting of ECL cell hyperplasia associated with high gas-\ntrin levels due to autoimmune fundic atrophic gastritis (type I NETs),\nhigh gastrin levels due to gastrinoma (type II NETs) or without ECL\nhyperplasia (type III NETs). More recently, general atrophy in chronic\nH. pylori associated gastritis,3 functional failure of parietal cells due\nto mutations4 or proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use5 have also been\nreported to be associated with NETs, some with a background of\nECL cell hyperplasia but in cases of proton pump inhibition also\nassociated with parietal cell hyperplasia. These newly described gas-\ntric NETs are similar to the originally described type I gNETs as they\nare secondary to failed acid secretion. The secondary (type I and\ntype II) gNETs have a more indolent course2,5 and can be reversible\nif the cause can be impeded. It is therefore important to recognise\nthe associated gastric mucosal changes.6\nAdequate tumour sampling is essential for grading NETs as pre-\nscribed in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of gas-\ntrointestinal tumours of 2019.7 As NETs are usually located deep in\nthe mucosa (not at the surface) attention should be paid to this when\ntaking biopsies.\nGastric NETs are graded using the same criteria as for all gastroin-\ntestinal sites:8\nG1: mitotic count <2 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index <3% in hotspot\nof at least 500 cells.\nG2: mitotic count between 2 and 20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index\nbetween 3% and 20% in hotspot of at least 500 cells.\nG3: mitotic count >20 in 2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20% in hot-\nspot of at least 500 cells.\n1.2.2\n|\nEndoscopy\nThe primary diagnostic tool for gNETs is oesophagogastroduode-\nnoscopy (OGD). For the assessment of gastric NETs, not only rep-\nresentative biopsies of the tumour but also biopsies of the\nsurrounding mucosa and other parts of the stomach (antrum and\nbody-fundus) are essential as these give clues on the nature/\naetiology and, with this, the prognosis and treatment of the NET.\nIn addition, sampling of gastric juice for pH measurement is\nstrongly encouraged. Furthermore, virtual chromoendoscopy (nar-\nrow-band imaging, blue light imaging, i-scan) may be useful to pro-\nvide\nadditional\ninformation\nto\nidentify\nfield\nchanges\nor\nprecancerous lesions in underlying atrophic mucosa.9 In addition\nto OGD, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) should be performed in all\nlesions >1 cm regardless of type and in all lesions of type III\nregardless of size, unless large or metastatic lesions are found.\nReporting should include size of the lesion infiltration depth and\nassessment of local lymph nodes.\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of gNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to evaluate proliferative activity of the tumour (Ki67\nand/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\nTABLE 1\nList of questions.\nGASTRIC NET\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic resection for type I gNETs?

Evaluation of the type of gNET by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n1.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nBiomarker assessment should include fasting gastrin and chromo-\ngranin A (CgA). Whereas gastrin may be useful to differentiate\nbetween different types (elevated in type I and type II, normal in\ntype III), CgA is only useful as a tumour marker in type III gNETs.\nIn the presence of ongoing PPI therapy gastrin and CgA are not\ndiagnostic and are difficult to interpret. In general, caution should\nbe used when evaluating CgA values, considering the different\ndiagnostic accuracy of available assays. Parietal cell and intrinsic\nfactor antibodies, vitamin B12 and thyroid function parameters\nshould be measured in suspected cases of autoimmune gastritis.\nWhereas type I gNETs do not usually require additional cross-\nsectional imaging, type III gNETs should undergo cross-sectional\nimaging – liver contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nand/or contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal computed tomography\n(CT), with previous ingestion of water immediately before examina-\ntion, to fill stomach and duodenum and better depict small enhancing\nlesion in the arterial phase, and functional imaging, preferentially\nsomatostatin receptor PET/CT (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT).\nThese should also be considered in cases of type I gNETs with\nmetastases on EUS or high-risk features of metastases (G2, lymphatic\nor vascular invasion, size ≥1 cm). Recently, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT has\nbeen suggested in selected cases with tumour diameter >1 cm, G2\ntumours (perhaps Ki-67 > 10 but exact cutoff not determined), or R1\nmargins after endoscopic resection.10\nPrognosis depends on type, size, grading, histological risk factors\n(e.g., lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion), completeness of\nresection and initial tumour stage.\nRecommendations\n1. Gastrin assessment is useful to differentiate between different\ntypes of gNETs. CgA is useful as tumour marker only in type III\ngNETs (3b-A).\n2. Cross-sectional radiological imaging (CT/MRI) and 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT are not required in type I gNETs, unless metastases on EUS or\nin the presence of high-risk features (G2, vessel invasion, sus-\npected T2 on EUS ) (3b–A).\n1.3\n|\nManagement strategy for type I gNETs\n1.3.1\n|\nIntroduction\nTreatment options for type I gNETs include surveillance, endoscopic\nresection, somatostatin analogues (SSA) and eventually surgery. As\nprognosis is usually quite favourable and tumour growth slow and risk\nof metastases is below 1% in tumours <10 mm, all NET <1 cm can be\nobserved without any need for intervention.11,12 The ideal schedule\nfor observational OGD is not defined and clinical practice ranges from\nevery 6 months to every 2 years. Planning the first follow-up after\n6 months and then every 12 months is the most widely used\napproach. A regular rebiopsy of lesions is not necessary unless atypi-\ncal features (e.g., ulceration, erosion, pitting) appear, suggesting inva-\nsive progression of the lesion. The management of type I gNETs is\nsummarised in Figure 1.\n1.3.2\n|\nQ1 – What is the role of endoscopic\nresection for type I gNETs? Is additional treatment\nrequired in cases of R1 endoscopic resection?\nEndoscopic resection should be considered for type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm and for those lesions demonstrating increased Ki-67 as\nthese features are associated with an increased risk of metastases and\nprogression.11,13 Many small type I gNETs are G1 or low G2\n(Ki-67 < 10%);14 however, a Ki-67 cutoff has not been defined to\ndetermined when excision should be performed. Endoscopic ultraso-\nnography to determine depth of local invasion and assessment of local\nlymph nodes should be performed in lesions >1 cm and in smaller\ntumours with “high” G2 grade (cutoff not established) before any\nresection. No other imaging modality is required at this stage. The re-\nsection technique of choice depends on size and position of the\nlesion, invasion depth and local experience. Endoscopic mucosal re-\nsection (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and full-\nthickness resection (FTR) are all associated with a low risk profile for\nboth bleeding and perforation. It is not clear which is the best endo-\nscopic technique to be used for achieving a complete R0 resection.15\nHowever, resection by ESD or FTR achieve higher rates of R0 resec-\ntion, but no randomised trials have compared all techniques head-to-\nhead.16,17 For R1 resection status a re-resection in a “step-up”\napproach could be recommended (e.g., ESD after EMR, FTR after\nESD), although data showing risk of local recurrence after R1\nTABLE 2\nDiagnostic criteria and prognosis of gNET subtypes.\nType\nGastric pH\nHistology of surrounding mucosa\nGastrin levels\nGrading\nPrognosis\nI\nHigh\nGastric body atrophy, ECL-cell\nhyperplasia\nHigh\nG1 (G2)\nExcellent: Risk of metastases very low.

Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm (2b-A).\n2. ESD and FTR are more effective to achieve R0 resection compared\nto EMR (2b-B).\n3. In case of incomplete resection (R1) of a NET >1 cm a step-up\napproach (EMR > ESD > FTR > surgery) is recommended (4-C).\n1.3.3\n|\nQ2 – When should somatostatin analogues\nbe used to treat type I gNETs?\nType I gNETs usually express somatostatin receptors. Thus, therapy\nwith SSA can be initiated in metastasised patients or patients not\namenable to endoscopic or surgical resection (e.g., difficult location,\nold age, comorbidities). SSA therapy is associated with a high com-\nplete response rate of 25%–100%, but relapse is frequently observed\nafter discontinuation of therapy.20 Thus, continuous therapy would be\nthe appropriate approach. Another reason for starting SSA therapy\ncould be large tumour size or the requirement of repeated endoscopic\nresection for progressive lesions, although data evaluating this\napproach are lacking. Another therapeutic approach could be direct\ninhibition of gastrin signalling in tumour cells. Indeed, the gastrin\nreceptor\ninhibitor\nnetazepide\nhas\nbeen\nevaluated\nin\na\nproof-\nof-concept phase II trial with 16 patients showing a complete\nresponse rate in 30% of patients.21 Like SSA treatment, tumour\nrelapse after discontinuation was observed in all patients. The clinical\nbenefit of netazepide needs to be evaluated in larger randomised clini-\ncal trials before any recommendation for its use can be formulated.\nRecommendations\n1. In type I gNET patients when tumour resection is indicated but\nendoscopic or surgical techniques are not possible, SSA therapy is\nappropriate (2b-A).\n1.3.4\n|\nQ3 – What is the recommended follow-up\nschedule in type I gNETs?\nAn endoscopic follow-up every 12 months is recommended after\ncomplete endoscopic resection of a type I gNET. Whether this interval\ncan be increased after prolonged periods without evidence of relapse\nor whether the interval should be shortened in case of incomplete\n(R1) resection or risk factors associated with progression (grading G2,\nsize >20 mm) should be carefully discussed with the patient. In gen-\neral, no cross-sectional imaging is required for follow-up. In addition,\nrepeated evaluation of biomarkers CgA and gastrin should not be per-\nformed as these markers are elevated due to the underlying CAG and\nare not an indicator of relapse or progression. Follow-up OGD is\nrecommended in a type I gNET that does not require resection,\nalthough the optimal interval for planning endoscopy is not estab-\nlished\n(1–2 years\ncan\nbe\nconsidered,\nfollowing\nfirst\nfollow-up\n6–12 months after initial diagnosis). Apart from risk of tumour pro-\ngression or relapse after resection in NET lesions, patients with CAG\nFIGURE 1\nManagement of type I gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n4 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Although\nonly one international guideline recommends a regular endoscopic\nfollow-up for patients with CAG, the yearly rate of adenocarcinoma\ndetection is up to 1% in patients with type I gNETs.14 Whether this\nreflects an increased risk of adenocarcinoma development in patients\nwith a previous diagnosis of gNET is not clear. For CAG patients with-\nout a gNET, intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection have been\nlinked to an increased risk of adenocarcinoma progression. Given the\nhigh risk of adenocarcinoma detection upon follow-up of gNETs, this\nsupports the recommendation to perform an endoscopic follow-up\nevery 12–24 months in patients with previously diagnosed gNETs\n(specific timing may be proposed according to tumour size and histo-\nlogical features), whereas a 3-year interval is recommended in CAG\npatients without gNETs.22\nRecommendations\n1. An endoscopic follow-up by OGD is recommended 12 months\nafter complete endoscopic resection of type I gNET (2b-B).\n2. In\nthose\nnot\nrequiring\nresection\nfirst\nfollow-up\nshould\nbe\n12 months and then consider annual to every 1–2 years (2b-B).\n3. In patients with type I gNET, endoscopic follow-up by OGD is\nrecommended also given the risk of developing gastric adenocarci-\nnoma related to CAG (2b-A).\n1.3.5\n|\nQ4 – When is surgery recommended for\ntype I gNETs?\nAlthough type I gNETs are usually treated by an endoscopic approach,\nupfront surgical resection is recommended in all tumours that are\ngreater than 20 mm in size or with suspected muscolaris propria inva-\nsion (either on axial imaging or EUS). In addition, surgery could be\nconsidered in tumours showing high risk features on biopsy (e.g., high\ngrade 2 NET [cutoff not established], lymphovascular invasion). A lim-\nited resection with sampling of local lymph nodes is the preferred\napproach. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy should be\ndiscussed in patients with known lymph node metastases or might be\nproposed as a completion procedure after final histology has proven\nlymphatic spread, although there are no solid data supporting this\noption.\nEndoscopic resection should not be attempted in the presence of\ninvasion into the muscularis propria, suspected lymph node metasta-\nses or high-risk features of metastatic spread (e.g., high Ki-67, vascular\ninvasion, size >20 mm). These patients should receive full staging\nincluding cross-sectional imaging as described previously and 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT and upfront surgical management. The optimal cutoff\nvalue for Ki-67 is not determined, but Ki-67 values above 10% should\ntrigger evaluation of surgical treatment. In the rare instance of a G3\ntype I gNET a primarily surgical approach is recommended due to high\nrisk of metastases.23 Regarding tumour size, no clear cutoff for surgi-\ncal management can be defined. Only limited data exist on tumour\nsize and risk of metastases in the subgroup of type I gNETs. Data from\nthe SEER database and from a large series from Taiwan showed that a\ncutoff of 20 mm was associated with an increased risk of lymph node\nmetastases.13,24\nIn case of incomplete endoscopic resection (R1) or risk features in\nfinal pathology after endoscopic resection, a surgical approach should\nbe discussed with the patient to achieve R0 resection and/or re-\nsection of local lymph nodes to exclude metastatic spread. In cases of\nlesions not amenable to an endoscopic approach (e.g., location close\nto cardia) a primary surgical resection might be necessary.\nSSA treatment to reduce gastrin production, thus diminishing the\nstimulus for further tumour growth and progression, could be pro-\nposed in patients who could not undergo resection or for multiple\nlarger tumours or frequent relapse. Antrectomy should no longer be\nroutinely offered but might be an option in patients not tolerating\nSSA or declining continuous application.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgical approach is recommended in tumours >20 mm or with\nsuspected muscolaris propria invasion (either on axial imaging or\nEUS). In addition, surgery could be considered (in tumours show-\ning high risk features on biopsies (high Ki-67, lymphovascular inva-\nsion) (2b-A).\n2. Limited resection with local nodal sampling is the preferred surgical\nstrategy (3b-A).\n3. Gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy (specific kind of re-\nsection according with the tumour site) should be discussed in\npatients with known lymph node metastases or might be proposed\nas a completion procedure after final histology has proven lym-\nphatic spread after full exploration with cross sectional imaging\n(3b-A).\n1.4\n|\nType II gNETs\nType II gNETs are the rarest type of gNET (5% of cases). They arise in\nthe context of hypergastrinaemia associated with ZES which may\noccur in patients with MEN-I. Treatment of patients with type II\ngNETs\nstrictly\ndepends\non\nthe\nmanagement\nof\nthe\nMEN-I\nsyndrome.25\n1.5\n|\nManagement strategy for type III gNETS\n1.5.1\n|\nBackground\nType III gNETs have been traditionally regarded as highly aggressive\ntumours requiring extended surgical resections (i.e., partial or total\ngastrectomy) with lymphadenectomy. However, with the widespread\nuse of high-definition endoscopy, type III gNETs of smaller size and\nlower grade are increasingly being detected. A recent systematic\nreview of 147 type III gNENs in which tumour management was\nreported found that \u000145% were G1, 35% were G2 and 20% were\nG3.26 As a result, less invasive treatment options, ranging from endo-\nscopic resection to surgical wedge resection, have been investigated\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n5 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

The management of type III gNETs is sum-\nmarised in Figure 2.\n1.5.2\n|\nQ5 – Can endoscopic treatments be\nproposed to treat type III gNETs?\nType III gNETs should be carefully characterised using endoscopy,\nbiopsy, cross sectional thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI, and often\nfunctional imaging (68Ga-SSA-PET-CT or FDG/PET-CT depending on\ntumour grade) and in most cases EUS. Evidence from several retro-\nspective\ncase\nseries\nsuggests\nthat\ncarefully\nselected\npatients\nwho have no evidence of lymph node involvement can be safely and\nsuccessfully\nmanaged\nby\nendoscopic\nresection.\nEndoscopic\nre-\nsection appears to be most appropriate in patients who have localised\nG1 tumours ≤10 mm in diameter, because tumours greater than this\nsize are more likely to have lymph node metastases (even though\nthese may not be detected by imaging techniques).26,27 However\nendoscopic resection can also be considered in patients with slightly\nlarger tumours (<15 mm) and low G2 (Ki-67 3–10%) histology, partic-\nularly if the risks of surgical resection are considered to be high.26\nCurrent evidence does not support the use of a particular endoscopic\nresection technique (EMR vs. ESD).26 Some very small (<5 mm)\ntumours have also been unintentionally removed by avulsion biopsy\nwith no evidence of subsequent tumour recurrence, but this approach\nis\nnot\ngenerally\nrecommended.26\nPatients\nwith\npositive\nre-\nsection margins (R1) should be considered for additional endoscopic\nresection or surgical salvage if appropriate. Patients who have under-\ngone endoscopic resection should have close follow up with endos-\ncopy and imaging (thoracoabdominal CT and liver MRI) to detect local\nand distant tumour recurrence.\nRecommendations\n1. Endoscopic resection may be considered in patients who have\nlocalised type III G1 gNETs ≤10 mm, and occasionally larger\ntumours with Ki-67 <10% and <15 mm in diameter if the risks of\nsurgical\nresection\nare\nhigh\nprovided\nadequate\nstaging\nis\nallowed (3a–C).\n1.5.3\n|\nQ6 – When should limited or extended\nsurgical treatments be proposed to treat type III\ngNETs?\nSeveral clinicopathological features should be carefully evaluated to\nidentify the best surgical option (limited vs. extended resection) for\npatients with type III gNETs.\nA limited gastric wedge resection without standard lymphade-\nnectomy can be considered as treatment option in patients with loca-\nlised, G1 type III gNETs with no evidence of lymph node involvement\non preoperative imaging (including EUS).26 In patients fulfilling the\nabove-mentioned criteria, tumour size, depth of infiltration and pres-\nence of lymphovascular invasion should be further assessed to define\nthe extent of surgical resection. Therefore, a wedge resection can be\nsafely proposed to patients with G1 type III gNETs <20 mm, limited to\nthe submucosal layer and with no evidence of lymphovascular inva-\nsion.26,28 The role of wedge resections in patients with G2 type III gNETs\nremains debated, as tumour grade represents a powerful predictor of dis-\nease aggressiveness. Similarly, the tumour size cutoff for proposing lim-\nited surgical resection is not clearly defined. Type III gNETs <10 mm are\nusually managed with endoscopic resection, whereas a limited surgical re-\nsection might be considered as initial treatment option for lesions measur-\ning >10 mm and <20 mm.26 Recent experiences report favourable\nFIGURE 2\nManagement of type III gastric neuroendocrine tumours (gNETs).\n6 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Radical surgery is recommended as second-line treatment\nwhen final histology reveals one or more of the following findings: pres-\nence of nodal metastases, higher tumour grade compared with original\nbiopsy, lymphovascular invasion or lack of complete tumour clearance\n(R1), in patients initially managed with a limited wedge resection.26\nRecommendations\n1. A limited wedge resection with local nodal sampling (without standard\nlymphadenectomy) can be considered as a treatment option in patients\nwith localised, G1–G2 type III gNETs, with no evidence of lymphade-\nnopathy on full staging preoperative imaging (including EUS) (2b-B).\n2. Radical surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is recommended in\ntype III gNETs when nodal metastases are found/suspected on preop-\nerative staging, if Ki67 >20% or tumour diameter >20 mm (2b-B).\n1.5.4\n|\nQ7 – What scheduled follow-up is\nrecommended after endoscopic/surgical resection of\ntype III gNETs?\nFollow-up of patients who underwent surgical resection of type III\ngNETs is based on contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging (thora-\ncoabdominal CT/liver-MRI with sometimes OGD and/or EUS or func-\ntional imaging [68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and/or FDG-PET/CT depending on\nthe tumour grade]). The timing of follow-up has never been clearly\ndefined. When a total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy is per-\nformed, the follow-up schedule adopted for gastric adenocarcinoma\nshould be applied.26 On the other hand, patients managed conserva-\ntively (endoscopic or surgical local excision) should undergo OGD\nafter about 3 months to check the resection site and if this shows no\nmacroscopic residual tumour, they should have regular follow-up with\ncross-sectional imaging and endoscopy/EUS. The frequency and\nchoice of test will be influenced by the final tumour size and grade as\nwell as patient fitness and in most cases, it will be possible to reduce\nthe frequency of follow up as time progresses after resection. 68Ga-\nSSA-PET-CT (or FDG-PET/CT depending on the tumour grade) and\nbiopsies should be performed in the presence of a suspected disease\nrelapse, but they are not routinely part of the follow-up programme.30\nRecommendations\n1. Radiological follow-up by contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is recom-\nmended in patients treated by surgical resection for type III gNETs (5-A).\n2\n|\nDUODENAL NEUROENDOCRINE\nTUMOURS\n2.1\n|\nIntroduction – general background\nLike gNETs, duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs) are rare\ntumours but also with an increasing incidence found mostly at OGD\nor axial imaging for other reasons (incidental discovery) but also can\nbe found as primaries at workup for patients with stage 4 diseases or\nmore rarely as part of inherited syndromes such as MEN-I and neuro-\nfibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Most dNETs are non-functional tumours,\nbut duodenal tumours secreting gastrin are not infrequent (either spo-\nradic or as part of MEN-I) and more rarely tumours secreting somato-\nstatin (so called somatostatinomas) (see Guidance paper on functional\npancreatic NETs).\nThe overall incidence of dNETs is low accounting for only 2.8% of\nall NETs.31,32 The annual age adjusted incidence for dNET has been\nreported to be 0.19 per 100,000.32 Traditionally, dNETs have been\nclassified into non-functioning (approximately 90% of lesions) or func-\ntioning tumours (those secreting specific peptides of hormones elicit-\ning a functional clinical consequence or syndrome)33 and can be\nsummarised as:\n1. Non-functioning dNETs (they can secrete peptides and substances\nnot resulting in a clinical condition or syndrome).\n2. Duodenal composite gangliocytoma/neuroma and neuroendocrine\ntumour (CogNET) (previously known as gangliocytic paragan-\nglioma), occurs almost exclusively in the second part of the duode-\nnum and periampullary region and is considered a composite\ntumour of epithelial NETs and ganglioneuroma.34\n3. Duodenal gastrinoma (gastrin secreting and either sporadic or part\nof MEN-I where duodenal localisation is very frequent) and soma-\ntostatinomas (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance\npaper on functioning pancreatic NETs).\n4. Duodenal NEC (not discussed in the present paper, see guidance\npaper for digestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).\n2.2\n|\nAssessment of dNETs\n2.2.1\n|\nPathology\nPathological assessment and grading of dNETs is like that of NETs of\nall other sites. Adequate sampling is needed and the deep mucosal\nlocation of these lesions, usually suspected by the endoscopist due to\nthe smooth surface as opposed to the more common adenomas and\ncarcinomas of the duodenum, warrants an attempt to perform deep\nbiopsies. Morphologically, the main differential diagnosis in the duo-\ndenum is the CoGNET, previously classified as a ganglioneuroma or\nparaganglioma, but now shown to be more similar to NETs.36,37\nIn cases with a high proliferation rate (i.e., mitotic count >20 in\n2 mm2 and/or Ki-67 index >20%), NEC and adenocarcinoma with\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n7 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nneuroendocrine features should be ruled out (see guidance paper for\ndigestive neuroendocrine carcinomas35).\n2.2.2\n|\nEndoscopy\nMost dNETs are in the first or second part of the duodenum.38 Symp-\ntoms range from mostly none at incidental discovery to symptoms\nattributed to gastric outlet obstruction (in rare cases of large lesions)\nor anaemia. Patients with dNETs close to the ampulla and CoGNET\nwhich occur in the periampullary region can present with gastrointes-\ntinal bleeding, abdominal pain, anaemia or jaundice.38,39 Periampullary\ndNETs are not infrequent in patients with neurofibromatosis type\n1 (NF1), also known as Von Recklinghausen's disease including\nsomatostatinomas.40,41\nAt OGD, dNETs have similar features to gNETs but are typically\nsingle small sessile, erythematous or pale lesions in the duodenal cap,\nbulb or D1 to D2.6 In recent years, increasingly smaller lesions have\nbeen detected, owing to the better mucosal visualisation with modern\nendoscopic tools. The reported mean size of dNETs varies between\n7 mm and 1.5 cm.42 Up to 10% of dNETs can occur as multiple\ntumours, which should prompt a diagnosis of MEN-I. It has been\nreported that approximately a quarter to a third of patients with\ndNETs and ZES, have undiagnosed MEN-I.43,44\nEndoscopic characterisation of dNETs has been described by Bor-\nbath and colleagues.6 Diagnosis is usually confirmed at endoscopic\nforceps biopsy (care as very small lesions may be almost completely\nexcised at biopsy sampling and making future identification hard in\ncase of R1 resection). Tumours of 1 cm or above should have accurate\nlocal staging by EUS as regional lymph node metastases occur in up to\n40%–60% of cases, especially in duodenal gastrinomas.43,45,46\nRecommendations\nEvaluation of dNETs should always include:\n1. Biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate proliferative activ-\nity of the tumour (Ki-67 and/or mitotic count) for grading (2b-A).\n2. Endoscopic assessment of dNETs should include tumour location\nto identify periampullary tumours (2b-A).\n3. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm (3b-B).\n2.2.3\n|\nImaging and laboratory examinations\nDuodenal NETs are generally diagnosed by endoscopy and endoscopic\nultrasound. Computed tomography after ingestion of water to fill stom-\nach and duodenum, is recommended to help preoperative exploration.\nCT-enterography, MRI, 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT and 18F-DOPA-PET/CT are\nnot sufficiently accurate for localisation of well-differentiated gastrodu-\nodenal primary tumours,47–49 but these examinations are used to help\nstaging of regional and distant metastases.50\nLaboratory tests are required for patients newly diagnosed with\ndNET. It is especially important to recognise potential gastrinoma\n(serum gastrin, chromogranin and occasionally secretin testing). Other\nlaboratory tests, if symptoms are suggestive, may include somato-\nstatin, and very rarely growth hormone releasing factor and cortisol\nwith urinary 5-hydoxyindoleacetic acid.38 If a diagnosis of genetic syn-\ndrome is suspected (e.g., MEN-I or NF1) specific laboratory tests and\ngermline testing is advised38,51 Distinguishing between dNET and\nneurofibromas may be difficult in some cases especially on axial\nimaging.\nRecommendations\n1. Locoregional and distant staging examiner actions for dNETs\ninclude contrast-enhanced CT (with water ingestion), liver -MRI\nand 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT (3b-B).\n2. Ruling out gastrinoma and screening for genetic syndromes when\nappropriate should be considered for dNETs (3b-B).\n2.3\n|\nManagement strategy for dNETs\nFactors that need to be considered prior to endoscopic resection of\ndNET are:\n1. Size of tumour (commonly estimated at EUS and OGD).\n2. Depth of invasion in relation to the deep muscle layer (estimated\nat EUS).\n3. Any evidence of lymphadenopathy and/or metastatic spread on\nEUS, liver-MRI, thoracoabdominal CT and functional imaging, pref-\nerably 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4. Grade and morphology of tumour (determined by endoscopy, EUS\nand endoscopic biopsy).\n5. Endoscopic\nappearance:\ncentral\ndepression/ulceration\nimplies\ninvasion.\n6. Suitability for endoscopic resection: size of lesion/endoscopic\naccess/location of lesion/proximity to ampulla.\n7. Hormone secretion status.\n8. Patient age and performance status.\nSize of the lesion is not a definitive guide to the correct treat-\nment. Treatment options are: endoscopic surveillance, endoscopic re-\nsection (by EMR/ESD/underwater EMR/over the scope clip), local\nduodenal resection (LR) or pancreatoduodenectomy (PD). The out-\ncomes may be related to the factors of the tumour at presentation\nrather than the type of resection procedure.52 The management of\ndNETs is summarised in Figure 3.\nWhen defining surgical indications for dNET, several key points\nshould be considered (see section 8.3).\n2.3.1\n|\nQ8 – When is endoscopic\nresection indicated?\nVery small non-functioning lesions 5 mm or less in D1 are commonly\nremoved after lifting injection and snare (or by diagnostic biopsy)\nbefore any histological diagnosis is made and these lesions do not\nusually recur or metastasise.\n8 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\nFor younger and fitter patients who have lesions of 5–10 mm\n(and up to 15 mm in some centres), an opinion should be sought\nfrom therapeutic endoscopy about resection and the associated\nrisks. EUS should be performed as well as axial and functional imag-\ning. Most of these lesions are grade 1 and not invading the muscle\nlayer.\nIn\nthese\ncircumstances\nan\nendoscopic\nresection\nusing\nEMR/Cap EMR/ESD is reasonable, but risks of perforation are signif-\nicant, especially in D2. If endoscopic therapy is high risk (published\nrates of perforation 15%–25%) or unlikely to be curative, LR\n(i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision or enucleation) or pancrea-\ntoduodenectomy (PD) (if considered essential by the surgeon) should\nbe considered. Endoscopic therapy combined with laparoscopy for\nrescue in the event of perforation has been performed which may\nrepresent a novel and valuable alternative to ESD, able to guarantee\na\nhigh\nR0\nrate\nand\na\nlow\nrisk\nof\nintraoperative\nduodenal\nperforation.53\nDuodenal NETs can be multiple, particularly if they are gas-\ntrinomas, and an association with MEN-I exists. Somatostatino-\nmas\ncan\nalso\noccur\nin\nthe\nduodenum,\noften\nclose\nto\nthe\nampulla, but generally are without a clinical syndrome. There is\nan\nassociation\nwith\nNF1\n(functioning\ntumours\nare\nbeing\naddressed in a separate guidance paper on pancreatic func-\ntional NETs).\nRecommendations\n1. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 should be removed\nusing EMR type techniques (3b-C).\n2. Lesions of 5–10 mm (and up to 15 mm in some centres) can be\nremoved endoscopically after imaging work-up, but risks are rela-\ntively high (3b-C).\n2.3.2\n|\nQ9 – Can a “watch and wait” strategy be\nproposed in dNETs?\nA watch and wait policy could be considered for very small (<5 mm)\ndNETs that cannot easily be resected, are non-functional, G1 and not\ninvading the muscularis propria. This policy has usually been applied in\npatients unfit for endoscopic resection or surgery, since a more defini-\ntive therapy would be recommended in most cases, although a watch\nand wait policy has more recently been recommended as a result from\nsome small series with limited follow-up. It is not clear if watch and\nwait is a suitable option in a patient who is fit for resection.54,55\nRecommendations\nThere is very limited evidence for a watch and wait policy and generally\nthis is applied to those unfit for surgery or endoscopic resection (3b-C).\n2.3.3\n|\nQ10 – When is surgery indicated?\nData on nodal risk in very small non-functioning dNETs are scarce.\nSome series report nodal metastases as a common finding in patients\nwith dNET (40%–60%), with tumour size being the most relevant risk\nFIGURE 3\nManagement of duodenal neuroendocrine tumours (dNETs).\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n9 of 14\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025].

Tumour location\nmay be another important feature to be considered when defining sur-\ngical indication. Lesions arising in the ampullary/periampullary area dif-\nfer from other dNETs due to a more aggressive biological behaviour in\nsome studies57 but not in others.56 Functioning neoplasms harbour a\nhigher metastatic potential.58 Tumour invasion beyond the submucosa,\ntumour grade G2–G3 and lymphovascular invasion are factors affecting\nthe risk of nodal metastases.\nDespite very low grade evidence surgical resection may be indi-\ncated in patients with dNETs showing any of the following features:\n1. Tumour size >10 mm; (some centres may advocate endoscopic\nremoval in 10–15 mm).\n2. Tumour extending beyond the submucosa.\n3. Tumour grade G2–G3.\n4. Lymphovascular invasion.\n5. Functioning neoplasms.\nRegarding the extent of resection, PD (pancreatoduodenectomy)\nand LR (local resection) represent the two main alternatives:\nIn general, pancreatoduodenectomy with lymphadenectomy is the\nprocedure of choice for ampullary/periampullary neoplasms, due to\ntheir particular aggressiveness. When nodal metastases are pre- or\nintraoperatively identified, PD with nodal dissection is indicated in order\nto obtain a proper oncological clearance. However, for lesions <20 mm,\nless aggressive approaches (i.e., local excision with lymphadenectomy or\npancreas-sparing total duodenectomy) may be considered options. At\nleast eight lymph nodes should be harvested to stage patients accu-\nrately.59 However, radical surgery is associated with a high rate of\nshort- and long-term complications. Therefore, when feasible from an\noncological perspective, other surgical strategies should be considered.\nLocal duodenal resection (i.e., duodenotomy with tumour excision\nor enucleation) represents a valuable and safe option, especially for\npatients with non-ampullary, non-functioning, dNET and without sus-\npected nodal involvement at staging,52 (where endoscopic resection is\nnot possible). The role of nodal dissection in this setting is unclear as\nrecent experience does not support the clearance of occult nodal\nmetastases due to lack of association with survival advantages.60\nRecommendations. 1. Surgery is recommended in cases of size >10–\n15 mm and/or tumour extending beyond the\nsubmucosa and/or grade G2-G3 and/or lym-\nphovascular invasion (3-B).\n3\n|\nMANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR\nGASTRIC AND DUODENAL G2–G3\nMETASTATIC NETS\n3.1\n|\nTreatment with curative intent\nDue to the lack of effective systemic therapeutic options surgery\nshould be evaluated even in the presence of metastatic condition\ndepending on the tumour spread and tumour biology if a complete\ntumour resection seems to be possible (R0-resection).\nGastrectomy with D2-lymphadenectomy includes the removal of\nlocoregional lymph nodes, so the presence of locoregional lymph\nnode metastases should not preclude surgery as a treatment option.\nIn dNET a transduodenal tumour excision with lymph node sampling\nor pancreatoduodenectomy are the treatments of choice.30 The com-\nplete resection of single or multiple liver metastases might be benefi-\ncial even for G3 tumours.61 Thus, surgical resection should be\nevaluated in G2 and in very selected cases of G3-NET depending on\nthe general health condition of the patient. Single or multiple metas-\ntases in other locations should be evaluated for a complete\nresection.\n3.2\n|\nWidespread metastatic disease\nIn the presence of metastases, a systemic therapeutic approach is\nsimilar to that recommended for advanced/unresectable NET from\nother primary sites, owing to the lack of available data in homoge-\nneous series of gastric or duodenal NETs. Somatostatin analogues\nare indicated for NETs G1–G2 with low Ki67 (<10%), and positive\nsomatostatin receptors but can be administered in tumours with\nhigher Ki-67 if slow tumour growth or slow progression are seen.\nPeptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is a valid option\ndepending on the receptor status of the tumour. Molecular-\ntargeted therapy with everolimus is a therapeutic option, but with\nlimited\nevidence.62\nIn\nNET\nG3\nchemotherapy\nshould\nbe\nadministered.63\n3.3\n|\nPalliative primary tumour resection\nIn cases of unresectable distant metastases a palliative primary\ntumour resection can be considered rarely to avoid local complica-\ntions. The kind and extent of surgery has to be evaluated depending\non the location of the tumour and possibility of complications of sur-\ngery. A gastrectomy can be necessary in rare cases but a wedge resec-\ntion, distal or subtotal gastric resection should be preferred to reduce\nperioperative\nmorbidity.\nA\ngastric\nbypass\nwithout\ntumour\nre-\nsection should be favoured in case of bulky disease with infiltration of\nthe visceral arteries or pancreas.\n3.4\n|\nLocal recurrence\nIn the presence of local recurrence without diffuse metastatic spread,\noperative resection should be favoured to avoid bleeding or intestinal\nobstruction and to maintain quality of life. Even in the presence of dis-\ntant metastatic spread palliative surgery should be considered to\nensure quality of life depending on the tumour biology and the gen-\neral health status of the patient. Endoscopic procedures such as stent\nor jejunal catheterisation are alternatives for patients with a poor gen-\neral health status.\n10 of 14\nPANZUTO ET AL.\n 13652826, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jne.13306 by Universitat Bern, Wiley Online Library on [26/06/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License\n\n---\n3.5\n|\nFollow-up\nThe interval for follow-up by contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT\nand/or liver-MRI, 3–12 months, should be based on the malignant\npotential of the tumour.64 Follow-up by additional 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT\nis helpful when the patient's clinical status and the results of CT or\nMRI and biochemistry are discordant. The sensitivity of 68Ga-SSA-\nPET-CT is superior to contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT for\ncharacterisation and detection of lymph node metastases and for visu-\nalisation of metastases to bone and liver,65 and therefore provides\nearlier detection of new lesions. FDG-PET/CT is instead used in G3\ntumours and can also be helpful in high G2 NET when 68Ga-SSA-PET-\nCT is negative. Re-evaluation of untreated patients should be per-\nformed at 3–6 month intervals.\nRecommendations\n1. Surgery with curative intention of metastatic gastroduodenal NET\nG1/G2/G3 should be performed, if a complete tumour (including\nmetastases) resection seems feasible (4-B).\n2. Palliative surgery (primary resection, bypass) may be indicated in\nmetastatic disease to maintain quality of life (4-C).\n3. The choice of systemic therapy for metastatic gastroduodenal NET\ndepends on tumour grading and includes biotherapy, everolimus,\nPRRT and chemotherapy (4-B).\n4\n|\nCONCLUSIONS\n4.1\n|\nGastric NETs\n1. Evaluation of the type of gNETs by assessing separate biopsies\nfrom the antral and fundic mucosa is needed.\n2. Endoscopic resection should be proposed in type I gNETs larger\nthan 1 cm, whereas a surgical approach should be proposed in\ntumours larger than 2 cm. Tumours between 1 cm and 2 cm in size\nare usually managed by endoscopic resection after EUS evaluation,\nalthough surgery might be indicated in selected cases with G2\ntumours and high Ki-67 (cutoff not established), and in G3\ntumours.\n3. In type III gNETs, a surgical approach is recommended. However,\nin selected patients with small (<1 cm) G1 tumours, endoscopic re-\nsection may be appropriate.\n4.2\n|\nDuodenal NETs\n1. Endoscopic assessment should include tumour location to identify\nperiampullary tumours. EUS is recommended in tumours >1 cm.\n2. Very small non-functioning tumours in D1 may be removed using\nEMR type techniques, whereas larger tumours (>1 cm) and/or\ntumour extending beyond the submucosa and/or grades G2–G3\nand/or lymphovascular invasion and/or functioning neoplasms\nshould be managed by a surgical approach after complete disease\nstaging by dedicated CT, liver-MRI+/\u0003 68Ga-SSA-PET-CT.\n4.3\n|\nUnmet needs\n1. The prognostic role of Ki67 in type I gNETs is unclear.\n2. Long-term outcomes of endoscopic resection for both selected\ngastric type 3 NETs, and also duodenal NETs, are lacking.\n3. The risk of progression in low-grade gastroduodenal NETs after\nincomplete R1 endoscopic resection is unknown.\n4. The role of somatostatin analogue treatments in managing type I\ngNETs has not yet been established.\n5. More data are required regarding natural history PPI-induced\ngNETs.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nFrancesco Panzuto: Conceptualization; methodology; supervision;\nwriting – original draft; writing – review and editing.

Berruti7, on behalf of the ESMO Guidelines\nCommittee*\n1Department of Medicine 1, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany; 2Department of Endocrine Oncology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; 3Department\nof Surgery, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientiﬁc Institute, Milan, Italy; 4Cyclotron Rotterdam BV, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; 5Department of\nSurgical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden; 6Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland; 7Department of Medical and Surgical Specialties,\nRadiological Sciences and Public Health, Medical Oncology Unit, University of Brescia, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy\nAvailable online 6 April 2020\nKey words: Clinical Practice Guidelines, diagnosis, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, GEP-NENs,\nGEP-NETs, Pan-NENs, SI-NETs, treatment and follow-up\nINTRODUCTION\nNeuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) arise from the diffuse\nneuroendocrine cell system and may occur at many\ndifferent disease sites. Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may\nsecrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF\nto functional status.10\nRecommendation\n\u0002 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,\ngrading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and\nsynaptophysin should be reported. SSTR staining or spe-\nciﬁc staining for peptide hormones and amines as well as\nuse of molecular markers is optional and dependent on\nclinical requirements [III, A].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nDisease stage and tumour grade are the two major indepen-\ndent prognostic parameters and should always be assessed\n[III, A]. Since the WHO 2010 classiﬁcation, NENs are graded\nTable 1.

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs. FDG is the tracer of choice\nfor G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose\nmetabolism and less SSTR expression than the low-grade\nNETs, for which the situation is usually the reverse.29 Com-\nbined SSTR imaging and FDG-PET-CT has been shown to be\ncomplementary for lesion detection. Findings of FDG-\npositive NETs at PET-CT indicate worse prognosis.29e31\nThe author panel believes that optimal diagnostic and\nprognostic information can be achieved by submitting all\nNET G2/G3 patients to PET-CT with both FDG and 68Ga-\nTable 3.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic\nradical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph\nnodes can be achieved in \u000480% of cases if carried out by\nexperienced surgeons.40\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locore-\ngional\ndisease\nin\nNET\nG1\nand\nG2.\nBefore\nany\nFigure 2.

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].

SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also\nnamed biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in\nNETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the\nmultiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been\nintroduced more recently in the management of NETs.

SSAs are an established anti-\nproliferative therapy in metastatic GEP-NETs, based on two\nplacebo-controlled trials. Most frequently, they are used in\nﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the\nsettings in which they have been studied. Overall response\nrates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset. The\nmedian progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached\nwith lanreotide (>27 months) and was 18 months in the\nplacebo arm.59 The CLARINET extension study also showed\nefﬁcacy in\nprogressive\ndisease\npatients with\nentero-\npancreatic NETs.60 There is very good long-term tolerability\nof both SSAs.47,58,59 SSAs can be recommended for tumour\ngrowth control in advanced SSTR-positive, slowly-growing\nGI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I, A; European Society\nfor Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A; ESMO-\nMCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48]. There was a beneﬁt in terms of PFS prolon-\ngation in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56 (0.37e0.8)] and the\nlung NET subgroup [HR 0.5 (0.28e0.88)], and everolimus is\nEMA-approved for NF-GI and lung NETs. Everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive GI NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%).

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.\nThe stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.\nA watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

However, it is controversial if primary tumour\nremoval in patients with stage IV disease translates to\nan improvement in survival.\n\u0002 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-\ntoms in patients affected by metastatic functioning\nSI-NETs [IV, B].\n\u0002 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms\nrelated to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery\nmay be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered\nin patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].\n\u0002 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].\n\u0002 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].\nHowever, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy\nwith platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].\n\u0002 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid\noptions for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with\nother systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.\nThe choice of the procedures depends on the local\nexpertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and\nthe localisation of liver involvement [V, C].\n\u0002 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be\napplied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve\ncontrol of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-\ntions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)\n[IV, A].\n\u0002 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,\nlocoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-\ntive to systemic treatment [IV, B].\n\u0002 Systemic therapy should be administered to control\ntumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth\n[I, A].\n\u0002 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients\nwith CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,\nglucagonoma) [I, A].\n\u0002 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-\ntristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-\nment to SSAs [I, A].\n\u0002 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve\nsymptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of\nIFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].\n\u0002 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].\n\u0002 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires\ncareful information to be given to the patient before and\ndirectly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper\ntreatment [IV, A].\n\u0002 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on\npathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth\nbehaviour and SSTR imaging.\n\u0002 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients\nwith low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable\ndisease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term\nfavourable prognosis.\n\u0002 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for\ntumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing\nSSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,\nA; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. Positive SSTR\nstatus is generally required but is not predictive of\nresponse.\n\u0002 IFN-a can be considered for antiproliferative therapy\nif other treatment options have been exploited or\nare not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative on functional\nimaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where there\nare fewer therapy options compared with Pan-NETs\n[IV, B].\n\u0002 Everolimus is EMA-approved for progressive Pan-NET G1/\nG2 with or without prior ChT, for NF-GI and lung NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In GI NETs, everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive disease [I, A].\n\u0002 The use of everolimus after PRRT is recommended in\nintestinal NETs, if PRRT is available [V, A], although the\ntreatment sequence needs to be further studied in the\nabsence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\n\u0002 The combination therapy of SSA and everolimus for an\nantiproliferative purpose is not recommended [II, D].\nM. Pavel et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 7\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.304\n855\n\n---\n\u0002 Sunitinib is one of the EMA-approved treatment options\nin advanced progressive Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1\nscore: 3].\n\u0002 Both sunitinib and everolimus cannot be recommended\nin NEC G3 outside of clinical trials [V, E].\n\u0002 The use of systemic ChT is recommended in advanced\nPan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A].\nB In patients with non-resectable LMs and/or other\ndistant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs, STZ/5-FU is\nrecommended in progressive disease [II, A].\nB TEM alone or in combination with CAP is recommen-\nded as alternative ChT in Pan-NETs [II, B].\nB Systemic ChT can also be recommended in bulky\ndisease\nwithout\nprior\ntumour\nprogression\nin\nPan-NETs [II, B].\nB Cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide is recommen-\nded standard ﬁrst-line ChT in NEC G3 [III, A]. There is\nno established second-line therapy, but different\nregimens [e.g. 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI),\n5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin\n(FOLFOX),\nCAPTEM\n\u0006\nbevacizumab] may be considered [IV, B].\n\u0002 In NET G3, response rates to cisplatin/etoposide are\nlow, and the use of this combination is not recommen-\nded [IV, C].\n\u0002 ChT cannot be recommended in well-differentiated\nslowly growing NETs of the GI tract [II, C]; exceptions\nmay be rapidly progressive tumours or NET G2 with\nhigher Ki-67 close to NET G3 [V, C].\n\u0002 PRRT is recommended as second-line therapy in patients\nwith midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs who\nfulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT [I, A].\n\u0002 177Lu-DOTATATE is EMA- and FDA-approved for patients\nwith midgut NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] and\nPan-NETs [III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4].\n\u0002 In Pan-NETs, PRRT should be used after failure of\napproved therapies [III, A].\n\u0002 In carefully selected patients, PRRT may be considered in\nNET G3 [IV, C].\n\u0002 SSA should be combined with PRRT in patients with\nfunctioning tumours (CS) to prevent increasing symp-\ntoms such as diarrhoea and/or ﬂushing and hormonal\ncrisis soon after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 It is also common practice to continue SSA beyond PRRT\nin functioning tumours, as a full resolution of CS-related\nsymptoms is rarely achieved after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 The combination of SSA with PRRT is not recommended\nin patients with NF-NETs, [IV, C] and it remains unclear if\nSSA should be continued after PRRT as a maintenance\ntherapy.\nPERSONALISED MEDICINE\nIn the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity of\ncomparative\nrandomised\ntrials,\ntherapy\nselection\nin\nadvanced non-resectable disease is frequently based on\nindividual patient clinical and pathological features and\nSSTR imaging [IV, A]. Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence. NSE and\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be monitored in NEC;\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Conventional imaging\nincludes thoracic and abdominal scans every 2e3 months.\nFDG-PET may be required in case of suspected recurrence to\ndiscriminate lesions from unspeciﬁc ﬁndings; otherwise,\nhigh-resolution CT is the imaging method of choice, unless\nresection is considered in locally advanced NEN G3,\nwhere FDG-PET is mandatory to exclude distant metastatic\ndisease.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional\nand SSTR imaging [V, B].\n\u0002 In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1eG2, it is recom-\nmended that imaging is carried out every 3e6 months\n(CT or MRI), and in NEC G3 every 2e3 months [V, C].\nSimilar staging intervals apply to advanced disease.\n\u0002 Follow-up should be lifelong, although the staging inter-\nvals may be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up.\n\u0002 Small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix or rectum do not need any follow-up if\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in\naccordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures\nfor Clinical Practice Guidelines development, http://www.\nesmo.org/Guidelines/ESMOGuidelines-Methodology.\nThe\nrelevant literature has been selected by the expert authors.\nAn ESMO-MCBS table with ESMO-MCBS scores is included\nin supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.107 Levels of evidence and grades of recommenda-\ntion have been applied using the system shown in\nsupplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.108 Statements without grading were considered\njustiﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts and the\nESMO Faculty.
