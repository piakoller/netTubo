Both malignancies are rare. ACC has an estimated\nincidence of w0.5-2 new cases per million people per year.1,2\nPhaeochromocytomas are catecholamine-producing neuro-\nendocrine tumours arising from chromafﬁn cells of the\nadrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia. The latter are\nusually called paraganglioma, leading to the combined term\nphaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs). The\ndetected incidence of PPGLs is commonly reported at 2-8 per\nmillion per year3 (supplementary information, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).\nAll patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL\nshould be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team\nmeeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis (ideally\nbefore surgery) and in case of progressive disease.\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nEvery patient with (suspected) ACC or PPGL should undergo\ncareful clinical assessment, including case history, clinical\nexamination for symptoms and signs of adrenal hormone\nexcess. For more details on this topic, we refer to more\ncomprehensive guidelines and reviews.3-8\nHormonal evaluation\nThe aims of hormonal evaluation are multiple: (i) hormone\nassays provide orientation to the nature of the adrenal\nmass and can be useful to assess presence of malignancy;\n(ii) a phaeochromocytoma should always be ruled out,\nbecause these tumours can induce life-threatening crises,\nrequiring speciﬁc management before any intervention; (iii)\nmassive adrenocortical steroid excess can impact short-\nterm survival and quality of life (QoL), requiring speciﬁc\ntreatments to block impacts of hormonal excess; (iv)\nabnormal hormone secretions may serve as biological\nmarkers for the follow-up of patients; (v) in case of large\nbilateral adrenal masses, a systematic assessment of adre-\nnal function is recommended to rule out adrenal insufﬁ-\nciency. Precise hormone assays have been detailed in recent\nguideline statements,4,5,9,10 and are summarised in Table 1.\nFor all adrenal masses, the diagnosis of phaeochro-\nmocytoma\nshould\nbe\nsystematically\nassessed\nby\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: June 2020.

For differential diag-\nnosis of an adrenal mass, computed tomography (CT) and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both effective [IV, A].\nAlthough these methods cannot determine the exact entity\nof the mass, both are able to correctly diagnose a subset of\nbenign tumoursdat least when carried out according to\nstate-of-the-art criteria. The single best criterion to diagnose\na benign tumour (e.g. adenoma) remains Hounsﬁeld units\n\u000210 in an unenhanced CT.17 However, other imaging\ncriteria, such as rapid washout in 10- or 15-min delayed\ncontrast-enhanced CT, signal intensity loss using opposed-\nphase MRI, and low 2-ﬂuorine-18 [18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-\nglucose (FDG) uptake in [18F]FDG-positron electron to-\nmography (PET)/CT are also suggestive of a benign tumour.\nMost ACCs show an inhomogeneous appearance in CT or\nMRI with irregular margins and irregular enhancement of\nsolid components after intravenous injection of contrasted\nagent. Detection of local invasion or tumour extension into\nthe inferior vena cava, as well as lymph node or other\nmetastasesdincluding lung and liverdis mandatory before\nplanning any surgery. Therefore, cross-sectional imaging\nof the chest, abdomen and pelvis is required preoperatively\n[V, A].\nFor PPGLs, conventional radiological imaging can be\nimportant to determine the presence of metastases. How-\never, neither CT nor MRI can be used to determine whether\nPPGLs are benign or malignant. Malignancy can only be\ndetermined from the presence of metastatic lesions at sites\nwhere chromafﬁn cells are normally absent. Without such\nevidence, all PPGLs should be considered potentially ma-\nlignant, with risk dependent on several factors as outlined\nbelow.\nThere are a number of functional imaging modalities\navailable for patients with PPGLs (supplementary File,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). The indication is twofold: (i) best tumour staging in\npatients with suspected metastases (e.g. by conventional\nimaging) or with presumably high risk for metastases; (ii) to\nevaluate the option of a radionuclide-based therapy in pa-\ntients with nonresectable PPGL. For assessments of meta-\nstatic risk for the ﬁrst indication the authors suggest the\npresence of one or more of the following criteria:\n\u0003 tumour size \u00045 cm;\n\u0003 any extra-adrenal paraganglioma;\n\u0003 known succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur\nsubunit B (SDHB) germline mutation; or\n\u0003 plasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above\nthe upper cut-offs of reference intervals.\nFor imaging-based diagnosis of metastatic PPGLs, it is\nimportant to avoid confusing metastases with multiple\nprimary tumours that often occur in patients with heredi-\ntary PPGL syndromes. Additionally, local recurrences should\nnot be misdiagnosed as metastases.\nPathology\nBiopsy of adrenal tumours is usually contraindicated\nbecause of the risk of tumour spillage, poor diagnostic po-\nwer to discriminate benign from malignant adrenocortical\ntumours and risk of hypertensive crises in phaeochromo-\ncytoma. However, a biopsy might be indicated in an adrenal\nmass without any hormone excess in patients with a history\nof extra-adrenal cancers to exclude or prove an adrenal\nmetastasis of an extra-adrenal malignancy, and in patients\nin whom tumour sequencing is desired.\nThe pathological differential diagnosis of adrenal neo-\nplasias in both biopsied and resected specimens is primarily\nbased on morphological features requiring an experienced\npathologist [IV, A]. Preferably, a panel of immunohisto-\nchemical markers should be applied to aid diagnosis; for\nexample, steroidogenesis factor 1 (SF1) or, alternatively,\ninhibin-alpha, calretinin and melan-A for identiﬁcation of\nadrenocortical tumours and chromogranin A for identiﬁca-\ntion of PPGL [IV, A]. Staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and\nsynaptophysin may also be helpful to highlight PPGL, but\npositive results for synaptophysin are also possible in\nadrenocortical tumours. The differential diagnosis between\nACC and adenoma may be challenging as no single marker\nindicates malignancy. The most widely used diagnostic score\nhas been introduced by Weiss18,19 and includes nine pa-\nrameters (supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099) [IV, A]. A score of \u00043\nsuggests malignancy. In addition, the Ki-67 labelling index,\nas a marker of proliferative activity, may be useful and is\nvery\nhelpful\nfor\nprognostic\npurposes\n(supplementary\nTables S2 and S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nannonc.2020.08.2099).\nFor phaeochromocytomas, the situation is similarly\ndemanding. Tumour size, SDHB mutation status, extra-\nadrenal location and plasma methoxytyramine may all be\nused to indicate riskof metastasis. However,there is no single\nhistological or immunohistochemical parameter that can\npredict the clinical behaviour of PPGL. Nevertheless, several\nhistological scoring systems have been developed.20-23 All\nthese scores have value but none of them has reached\ngeneral acceptance. Therefore, according to the current\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcation, all PPGLs\nshould be considered to have some malignant potential.24 A\ndeﬁnitive diagnosis of malignancy can only be made by the\npresence of metastases at sites where chromafﬁn tissue is\nnormally absent (e.g. liver, bone, lungs or lymph nodes),\nassessed by pathology or imaging, in particular functional\nimaging.\nM.

The\ngene encoding subunit B of the SDHB complex is by far the\nmost important molecular contributor to malignant PPGL,\nwith at least 40% of all cases of metastatic PPGLs carrying\nmutations of this gene.25 Inactivation of SDHB reduces\nfunction of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, leading\nto activation of the hypoxia-inducible pathway and a\npseudohypoxic state characterised by increased angiogen-\nesis, growth and expression of mitogenic factors,26 but also\nto DNA hypermethylation, which is believed to provide a\nfurther drive to metastatic progression.27\nAt least 35% of PPGLs result from germline mutations of\nover 18 tumour-susceptibility genes identiﬁed to date,28-33\nwith those resulting in stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible fac-\ntors 1a and 2a (HIF1a and HIF2a) carrying a higher risk of\nmetastatic disease than those due to other mutations\n(supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). Risk is particularly high, reach-\ning 70% in patients with PPGL due to mutations in the SDHB\ngene.34 The vast majority of all metastatic PPGLs, including\ndisease due to SDHB mutations, develop from noradrenergic\nor dopaminergic PPGLs with poorly developed secretory\npathways. Nevertheless, a small minority of about 10% of\nmetastatic PPGLs develop from adrenal adrenergic tumours\nthat are characterised by production of epinephrine, as man-\nifested by increased plasma or urinary metanephrine.35\nOf note, metastatic disease may only become apparent\nmany years after the primary tumour is resected. This and\nlater development in some patients of locally recurrent\ndisease underscore the importance of recommendations for\nfollow-up of all patients with previously resected PPGLs.9\nRecommendations\n\u0003 All patients with an adrenal tumour suspected to be an\nACC or a phaeochromocytoma should undergo careful\nclinical assessment for signs of adrenal hormone excess.\n\u0003 All patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL\nshould be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team\nmeeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis and in\ncase of progressive disease.\n\u0003 All patients with suspected ACC require a comprehensive\nendocrinework-uptoidentifypotentialautonomousexcess\nTable 1.

However, all PPGLs are considered to have some\nmalignant potential.\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nACC\nIn the assessment of disease stage, the authors recommend\nthe tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation proposed\nby the European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumours\n(ENSAT) (supplementary Table S5, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099) [IV, A],36 because this\nsystem seems to be superior to other staging systems and is\nadapted by the Union for International Cancer Control\n(UICC) and WHO.24 As indicated above for correct staging,\nat least a CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis (or FDG-PET/\nCT including full-dose CT) is required. Recent data suggest\nthat lymph node involvement correlates with stage IV\nrather than stage III behaviour.37\nOverall, the prognosis of ACC is limited. However, pro-\nspective data suggest that in patients with complete\nresection of a localised stage II tumour 5-year overall sur-\nvival (OS) can be as high as 90%.38 In metastatic ACC, me-\ndian survival is about 15 months. However, even in this\ngroup, there is a subgroup of patients with long-term\nsurvival.36,37\nIt is well established that disease stage and margin-free\nresection are currently the most important prognostic fac-\ntors in ACC. For the European Society of Endocrinology\n(ESE)eENSAT guidelines, a comprehensive literature search\nfor prognostic factors has been carried out and only the\nproliferation marker Ki-67 and glucocorticoid excess showed\na robust association with prognosis [IV, A] (supplementary\nTable S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.\n08.2099).4,39 Many other (molecular) markers for aggres-\nsiveness and survival have been recently proposed, but their\nclinical use requires validation.\nPPGL\nIn 2017,the WHO proposed a tumourstaging system for PPGL\n(supplementary Table S6, available at https://doi.org/10.1\n016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).24 Although this staging classi-\nﬁcation remains to be validated, the authors recommend\nusing this system to harmonise disease classiﬁcation.\nDespite limitations, the authors suggest assessing the risk\nof metastatic disease in an individualised manner, taking into\naccount previous history of disease and the presence or\nabsence of a germline mutation of a tumour-susceptibility\ngene (supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/\n10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). For ﬁrst-time patients\nwithout any history of disease or known mutation, size and\nlocation of the primary tumour, and when available, any el-\nevations of plasma methoxytyramine during biochemical\ntesting seem important to consider when evaluating risk\nfor malignancy. As described above, the authors suggest\nestablishing ‘high risk of metastases’ when any patient pre-\nsents with one or more of the following criteria: (i) adrenal\nphaeochromocytoma \u00045 cm; (ii) an extra-adrenal para-\nganglioma; (iii) a known SDHB germline mutation; or (iv)\nplasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above the\nupper limit of reference intervals. In these patients, whole-\nbody functional imaging may be justiﬁed, particularly for\ncases involving more than one of those four criteria.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The ENSAT TNM system should be used for initial staging\nof ACC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Genetic counselling should be offered to all patients with\nPPGL.\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nSurgery\nSurgery is essential for treatment of both ACC and phaeo-\nchromocytoma. Adrenal surgery should be carried out only\nby surgeons with appropriate expertise and experience. The\nlack of consensus on what is deﬁned as appropriate expe-\nrience and the absence of evidence that a speciﬁc experi-\nence in adrenal surgery translates into improved outcomes\nlimit any recommendations concerning this issue.40-42 The\nrecent ESEeENSAT guidelines on ACC suggest a minimal\nannual workload of six adrenalectomies per year, but with\na preference for >20 surgeries per year. In addition to\nexpertise in adrenal surgery, sufﬁcient experience in onco-\nlogical surgery is essential [V, B].4 For best clinical outcome,\nthe entire operative team (including anaesthesiologists)\nshould be well-trained in adrenal surgery.\nM.

Therefore, a\nmargin-free complete resection (R0 resection) is key to\nachieving long-term survival [V, A].2,44 In order to obtain an\nR0 resection of a locally advanced ACC, it may be necessary\nto resect (parts of) adjacent organs such as the wall of the\nvena cava, liver, spleen, colon, pancreas and/or stomach [V,\nB]. Complete en bloc resection of the tumoural mass,\nincluding periadrenal fat and adjacent organs if necessary, is\nmandatory to avoid tumour rupture or spillage that por-\ntends an adverse outcome.45 Locoregional lymphadenec-\ntomy improves tumour staging and seems to lead to a\nfavourable oncological outcome.46\nRoutine lymphadenectomy should include at least the\nperiadrenal and hilar nodes [IV, A], although the best extent\nFigure 2.

In all\npatients with glucocorticoid excess, either overt or ‘subclin-\nical’, hydrocortisone must be administered during surgery\n(e.g. 150 mg/day) and postoperatively [V, A].4 Hormone\nhypersecretion, in particular cortisol excess, may portend\nan increased risk of recurrence after complete tumour\nremoval.39,49\nAdjuvant treatment\nMore than half of the ACC patients who have undergone\ncomplete removal of the tumour have a relapse risk, often\nwith metastases. This aggressive behaviour provides the\nrationale for the use of adjuvant therapy. Mitotane has\nbeen the reference drug for the management of ACC for\ndecades and is increasingly used also in adjuvant settings\nfollowing surgical removal of ACC. However, the value of\nthis approach remains a matter of controversy because only\na few studies have compared sufﬁciently large cohorts of\ntreated and control patients.4 All were retrospective and\nFigure 4.

One study with 207 patients\n(including 88 with mitotane) found that adjuvant mitotane\nwas associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS)50;\nhowever, the mitotane group was likely selected for a higher\nrisk of recurrence, a bias that cannot be fully adjusted for in\nmultivariate analysis.\nProbably, the best evidence supporting adjuvant mitotane\nuse comes from a multicentre, case-control study that cir-\ncumvented confounders by comparing patient groups treated\nat centres adopting two different treatment strategies. The\nstudy involved 177 patients, of whom 47 were followed in\nItalian reference centres that systematically adopted adjuvant\nmitotane to all radically operated ACC. Fifty-ﬁve Italian pa-\ntients and 75 German patients were followed in institutions\nnot administering adjuvant mitotane therapy.51 The outcome\nof this cohort has been recently updated, conﬁrming that the\nmitotane-treated patients have prolonged RFS compared with\npatients left untreated after surgery.52\nTwo recent meta-analyses have reported that adjuvant\nmitotane treatment reduces the risk of recurrence and\ndeath.4,53 In both analyses, the beneﬁt associated with mito-\ntane was signiﬁcant forOS, whereas itwas signiﬁcant forRFS in\nonly one study.53 Another retrospective multicentre study\ndemonstrated that blood mitotane concentrations \u000414 mg/l\nwere associated with a prolonged RFS in patients treated with\nadjuvant mitotane following macroscopically radical surgery.54\nOn these bases, the recent ESEeENSAT guidelines on the\nmanagement of ACC suggest that patients at high risk of\nrecurrence (stage III, or R1-RX resection, and/or Ki-67 index\n>10%) should be offered adjuvant mitotane [IV, B].4 By\ncontrast, adjuvant therapy has to be discussed on an individual\nbasis in patients fulﬁlling all the following criteria: stage I or II\ndisease, histologicallyproven R0 resection and Ki-67expressed\nin \u000210% of neoplastic cells, which deﬁne the category of low\nrisk of recurrence [V, B] (Figure 1).4 For these patients, the\nresults of the still ongoing randomised ADIUVO trial55 testing\nthe efﬁcacy of adjuvant mitotane therapy are awaited.\nThere are no data regarding the optimal duration of\nadjuvant mitotane; however, the authors recommend that\nadjuvant mitotane should be administered for at least 2\nyears [V, B], because the greatest frequency of disease\nrecurrence is expected within this time frame. However, it is\nnot advised to continue adjuvant mitotane beyond 5 years,\ndue to the low number of ACC recurrences occurring after\nthis time [V, B].4\nAdjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is able to reduce the risk of\nlocal recurrence but does not prevent distant recurrences\nand, as a consequence, does not impact OS.4 Therefore, it is\nreasonable to associate mitotane with RT in selected pa-\ntients with stage III ACC and/or R1 or RX resection, although\nthe combination carries increased toxicity [IV, B].4\nThe adjuvant use of cytotoxic drugs is not well established\nin ACC. Nevertheless, some centres are beginning to apply\ncytotoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin plus etoposide) in selected\npatients with very high riskof recurrence and this approach is\nbeing investigated in a randomised trial (NCT03583710).\nSpecial considerations on mitotane. Mitotane is a difﬁcult\ndrug to manage, with a long half-life, dose-limiting toxicity\nand a narrow therapeutic window. Supplementary Table S7,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099\nsummarises the key features of mitotane therapy.\nPPGL. AsinACC,thesurgicalexcisionofthetumouristheﬁrst-\nline treatment of PPGLs (Figure 2). However, laparoscopic/\nminimal invasive surgery is commonly the technique of ﬁrst\nchoice for resection adrenal and extra-adrenal PPGLs [V, A],\nbecause local invasion is rare and the likelihood of rupture of\nthe capsule seems less common than in ACC. It is obvious,\nhowever,that the resection should be complete and if there is\nany risk that this cannot be achieved by laparoscopic surgery,\nan open approach should be carried out. In patients with\nPPGL, exposure to high levels of circulating catecholamines\nduring surgery could cause hypertensive crises and arrhyth-\nmias. Therefore, all patients with PPGL should receive pre-\noperative preparation at least 10-14 days before surgery [V,\nA].5 Blood pressure targets for the treatment are <130/80\nmmHg in the supine position, and a systolic blood pressure\npreferably >90 mmHg in the upright position. The noncom-\npetitive a-adrenoreceptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, is\ntraditionally the most frequently used adrenergic blocking\nagent. A standard starting dose is 10 mg twice daily with ad-\njustments over the following days. Alternatively, doxazosin, a\ncompetitive and selective a1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, can\nbe similarly effective. If the target blood pressure is not\nreached, calcium antagonists (slow-release nifedipine) or\nmetyrosine may be used. Blockade of b-adrenergic receptors\nis indicated in patients developing tachyarrhythmias but\nshould never be started before blockade of a-receptors.\nGiven the likelihood of rapid intraoperative haemody-\nnamic lability, continuous monitoring of arterial and central\nvenous pressures is essential throughout surgery. Although\ntoday’s volatile anaesthetics are not inductive of hyperten-\nsive crisis, such crises can be induced by other manipulations\nduring surgical procedure (e.g. intubation, insufﬂation of\nperitoneum, direct palpation of the PPGL) or administration\nof certain drugs (e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines).56 Therefore,\nit is strongly recommended that anaesthesia is supervised by\nan experienced anaesthesiologist alert to the diagnosis of a\ncatecholamine-producing tumour. Hypertension during sur-\ngery may be treated with magnesium sulfate, intravenous a-\nadrenoreceptor antagonists (e.g. phentolamine), calcium\nantagonists and/or nitroprusside or nitroglycerine. Tachy-\ncardia can be treated with intravenous b-adrenergic receptor\nblockers (e.g. esmolol). Postoperative hypotension should be\nprevented by saline infusion the day before surgery. If this\nadverse event occurs, it should be treated aggressively. In\ngeneral, sufﬁcient rehydration and treatment of constipation\nare important parts of the preoperative management. Post-\noperative care should also focus on glucose levels because\nhypoglycaemia may occur after reduction of catecholamine\nlevels. Cytoreductive debulking surgery (R2) in malignant\nphaeochromocytoma may improve QoL and survival by\nreducing tumour burden and controlling hormonal hyperse-\ncretion [V, B].3\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Most authors recommend\nonly annual measurement of metanephrines in most pa-\ntients, but some authors carry out additionally regular\nimaging.\nMANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE\nACC\nPrognosis of advanced ACC patients is limited, the 5-year OS\nbeing <15%. However, several studies have highlighted\nconsiderable heterogeneity in survival. Indeed, prolonged\nsurvival has been reported especially in patients with\nresectable oligometastatic disease, with long intervals be-\ntween recurrences.57,58\nIn general, ﬁrst-line therapy in patients with advanced/\nmetastatic disease is mitotane alone or mitotane plus\nchemotherapy (ChT). Surgery and locoregional therapies\nshould be adopted in addition to systemic therapy in\nselected patient populations (Figure 3). The goal of the\ntherapy is to control tumour growth, hypersecretion-related\nsymptoms and prolong survival.\nA study of the ENSAT network recently identiﬁed the\nprognostic factors in patients with advanced disease.\nAccordingly the stage, as redeﬁned by a modiﬁed ENSAT\n(mENSAT) classiﬁcation,37 which takes into account the\nnumber of tumoural organs, has a major prognostic role\ntogether with the following four parameters grouped under\nthe label GRAS: (i) tumour Grade, (ii) Resection status of the\nprimary tumour, (iii) Age, and (iv) tumour-related or\nhormone-related Symptoms. Based on these results, a risk\nstratiﬁcation was introduced.59 Although this new risk\nclassiﬁcation looks interesting, it needs conﬁrmation in\nother studies before being fully applicable in clinics.\nMitotane\nmonotherapy.\nMitotane\nis\nthe\nonly\ndrug\napproved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in\nlocally\nadvanced\ninoperable\nand\nmetastatic\npatients\n(supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099);\nnevertheless,\nrandomised\ncontrolled prospective trials are lacking. Response rates in\nmetastatic ACC vary between 13% and 35% but much of\nthese data are derived from retrospective series, including\nstudies in 1960s with overall variability in response criteria.4\nFor details on mitotane management, see above and\nsupplementary Table S7, available at https://doi.org/10.10\n16/j.annonc.2020.08.2099. Owing to the latency of mito-\ntane to attain the therapeutic range, mitotane mono-\ntherapy is indicated in the management of patients with a\nlow tumour burden and/or more indolent disease (i.e. pa-\ntients with favourable prognostic parameters). At disease\nprogression, ChT with etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin\n(EDP) should be added to mitotane monotherapy [I, A].\nCytotoxic ChT. The combination of EDP and mitotane (EDP-M)\nis recommended in ﬁrst-line settings based on the FIRM-ACT\ntrial results [I, A] (supplementary Table S8, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099 and Figure 3).\nIn the phase III randomised trial including 304 patients,\nprogression-free survival (PFS) was clearly superior in patients\ntreated with EDP-M compared with patients treated with\nstreptozocin plusmitotane[5.0versus2.1months,hazardratio\n(HR) 0.55, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.43-0.69, P < 0.001].60\nHowever, the difference in OS was not signiﬁcant (14.8 versus\n12.0months, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02,P ¼ 0.07), presumably\ndue to the crossover and presence of mitotane in both arms.\nInterestingly, a survival advantage of the EDP-M arm was\nobserved in patients, who could not receive the second-line\ntherapy. In patients unsuitable for EDP-M, mitotane in com-\nbination with etoposide and cisplatin [V, B],61 or mitotane plus\ncisplatin, is an option [V, B].62\nM. Fassnacht et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 11\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099\n1485\n\n---\nIn second-line settings, after failure of EDP-M, the treat-\nment options are limited63 and enrolment of patients into\nclinical trials should be considered ﬁrst. Most patients with\nadvanced ACC remain in good clinical condition but urgently\nseek therapy. In the absence of trials, possible options are the\nassociation of gemcitabine plus capecitabine64,65 or strepto-\nzocin (supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/1\n0.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).60 With both treatments, the\nmedian PFS is short, between 2 and 4 months. Mitotane\ntherapy is sometimes continued in association with second-\nline therapies. However, this must be discussed with the\npatient according to tolerance to the drug and its effect on\nhormonal secretion. The optimal timing to discontinue\nmitotane is debated and could be discussed with the patient\nindividually in cases of progressive disease despite ‘thera-\npeutic’ drug levels or highest tolerated doses assessed at two\ndistinct evaluations.\nSurgery and local therapies. Surgery, including surgery of\nthe primary tumour, may be recommended in all patients\nwith oligometastatic ACC if a complete resection of all\ntumoural lesions is feasible [V, B].4 Additionally, patients\nwith an indolent disease course or under therapeutic\ncontrol might be eligible for surgery. It is also worthwhile\nto consider surgery or other local therapies in all patients\nin whom systemic therapy led to an objective response\nor long-term stable disease [V, B].66,67 A cytoreductive\nresection may also be indicated in rare cases of severe\nsymptomatic hormone excess, after attempts to control\nthe symptoms with a combination of fast-acting anti-\nsecretory agents (i.e. metyrapone) and mitotane68 and\nlocal therapies [V, B]. In these patients, postoperative\nmitotane is clearly advised [V, A]. Local therapies [e.g. RT,\nchemoembolisation,\nradiofrequency\nablation\n(RFA)]\nshould also be discussed in all patients with advanced\noligometastatic ACC [V, B].4\nIn case of a recurrence following ACC surgery, two critical\nquestions must be addressed: (i) What is the time interval\nsince the resection? and (ii) Did recurrence occur during\nongoing mitotane therapy (with effective blood levels)? If the\ndisease-free interval is at least 12 months and another\ncomplete R0 resection/ablation seems feasible, then surgery\nor, alternatively, other local therapies are clearly recom-\nmended [IV, A].69,70 However, if this time interval is <6\nmonths orifcomplete resection/ablation is not feasible,then,\nthe EDP-M provides the treatment of choice, especially if the\nrecurrence occurred during ongoing mitotane treatment at\ntherapeutic levels [IV, A].\nMolecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Several\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been investigated as\nsecond-line approaches in small phase II trials involving\nadvanced ACC (for review, see4,71). Results, however, have\nfailed to show signiﬁcant therapeutic efﬁcacy. In addition,\nthe insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor\nlinsitinib was tested in a multicentre placebo-controlled\nphase III trial (GALACTIC trial) and failed to improve\neither PFS or OS of advanced ACC patients who had already\nreceived systemic antineoplastic therapies.72\nThe results of the ﬁrst (small) trials with immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors in ACC were heterogeneous, with\nmedian PFS times of 1.8, 2.1, 2.6 and 6.75 months,\nrespectively.73-76 However, in one study with 39 patients,\ndisease control rate was 52% and median OS reached\nalmost 25 months, clearly suggesting that a least a subset of\npatients beneﬁts from this therapeutic approach.76\nManagement of hormone excess. In addition to sequelae\nof the malignant disease, patients with overt hyper-\ncortisolism suffer from immunosuppression, diabetes and\nmuscle weakness, which can signiﬁcantly impact QoL.\nSimilarly, severe androgen excess may dramatically impair\nwell-being in women. Therefore, medical therapy to control\nhormonal excess is recommended [V, A]. Mitotane is\nfrequently able to diminish steroid excess, but its efﬁcacy is\noften delayed by several weeks. In these circumstances,\nsteroidogenic enzyme inhibitors, such as metyrapone or\nketoconazole, can be useful [V, B]. Metyrapone is a well-\ntolerated drug and its metabolism and elimination are not\naltered by concomitant mitotane. Therefore, it can be safely\nadministered in association with mitotane and cytotoxic\nChT.68 Local therapies including liver embolisation may also\nbe discussed. All patients with clinically overt hormone\nexcess should be managed by physicians experienced with\nthese endocrine problems.\nPPGLs\nThe therapeutic strategy for metastatic PPGL primarily aims\nto control excessive catecholamine secretion and tumour\nburden, as there are no curative treatment options. Choices\nfor treatment include a watch-and-wait policy (including\nalpha blocker to control hypertension), locoregional thera-\npies,\nradiopharmaceutical\nagents,\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nmolecular-targeted therapies (Figure 4, supplementary\nTable S9, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2020.08.2099). Such choices should be discussed case by\ncase in a multidisciplinary specialised setting. In the absence\nof any published randomised trials and demonstrated\nimpact on survival, QoL for patients should always be\nconsidered in any justiﬁcation for a speciﬁc therapeutic\nintervention. Indeed, due to the indolent course of disease\nin some patients,77 an active surveillance policy may be\nindicated for those who are asymptomatic, have a low-to-\nintermediate tumour burden and absence of localised\ncomplications of any mass. In these patients, treatment-\nrelated adverse events may exceed any beneﬁt of therapy.\nSurgery. Although there is little possibility of a cure for\nmetastatic PPGLs, surgical resection of the primary tumour\nor metastatic lesions should be considered on a case-by-\ncase basis. Debulking surgery can improve symptoms and\npotentially prognosis by reducing secretion of catechol-\namines.78 Other local therapies are available for patients\nwith metastases, such as RT, RFA or chemoembolisation.\nLocal measures are also important to prevent bone-related\nevents.79 However, as with any invasive procedure, local\nablation may induce massive tumoural catecholamine\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Radionuclide therapy is an effective\ntreatment and [131I]MIBG is one of the most frequent ap-\nproaches with radionuclide doses ranging widely from 5.5\nto 38 GBq (150-1000 mCi). Approximately 50% of patients\nare eligible for [131I]MIBG therapy based on uptake from\ndiagnostic scans. Several studies have been published on\nthe efﬁcacy of [131I]MIBG treatment,3 mostly retrospective\nand only two prospective phase II trials.81,82 In both trials,\nobjective responses were observed in 23% of cases ac-\ncording to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours.\nLong-term survival of responders of over 6 years has been\nreported but progression at study entry was not a prereq-\nuisite for most studies. Objective responses were mainly\nobserved in patients with soft tissue metastases. Grade 3-4\ntoxicity was reported in 16%-83% of patients, mainly hae-\nmatological including myelodysplastic syndrome especially\nwith high activity doses.3,82 [131I]MIBG therapy could be\nconsidered as ﬁrst-line approach in patients displaying avid\nuptake of [123I]MIBG in all tumoural lesions who have\nunresectable, progressive PPGL or high tumour burden\n[III, A].\nAn alternative approach is a peptide receptor radioligand\ntherapy using somatostatin analogues labelled with iso-\ntopes delivering a cytotoxic radionuclide. More than 80% of\nPPGLs are detectable by somatostatin-based imaging.83 In\npatients with high uptake of PET tracers, such as gallium-68\n(68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogues (e.g. [68Ga]DOTA-\nTATE or DOTATOC or DOTANOC), treatment with yttrium-\n90-labelled [90Y]DOTATOC or lutetium-177-labelled [177Lu]\nDOTATATE could be similarly effective as MIBG-based\ntherapy, although the number of published studies/case\nseries is limited [V, B].84 Both radionuclide approaches can\nbe applied repeatedly (with a minimum time interval of 3-4\nmonths). However, toxicity frequently becomes a limiting\nfactor over time and beneﬁt should be re-evaluated after\nevery second therapy.\nSystemic ChT. Systemic ChT might be considered as a ﬁrst-\nline treatment in patients with PPGL who have no signiﬁ-\ncant uptake of radiotracers or that are also rapidly pro-\ngressing and associated with high tumour burden or are\nhighly symptomatic [IV, B]. ChT with cyclophosphamide- and\ndacarbazine-based regimens combined with vincristine (CVD)\nand/or doxorubicin (CVDD or CDD) are the most studied\nregimens.85 In the largest published study to date (n ¼ 52\npatients), 40% of patients treated with CVD, CDD or CVDD\nexperienced clinical beneﬁt, including reduction in tumour\nsize in 25% of cases.86 Based on retrospective data, temozo-\nlomide, an oral alternative to dacarbazine, seems to be as\neffective as the previous polyChT regimens.87 These studies\nsuggest that patients with SDHB mutations are especially\nsensitive to temozolomide due to the association with\nhypermethylation of the promoter for O6-methylguanine-\nDNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Furthermore, recent case\nreports provide limited evidence that metronomic temozo-\nlomide is also effective as a second-line therapy.88\nTargeted therapies. There is a rationale and some evidence\non the potential efﬁcacy of antiangiogenic drugs in malig-\nnant\nphaeochromocytomas,\nespecially\nthose\nbearing\nSDHB gene mutations.89 Sunitinib is a potent TKI, including\nvascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 1\nand 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)\nbeta, KIT, FLT3 and RET, and has been the most-studied\ntargeted therapy in PPGL. In addition to several impres-\nsive case reports involving sunitinib, there is one retro-\nspective series with 17 patients with progressive metastatic\nPPGL.90 Of 14 evaluable patients, three had a partial\nresponse (21%) and ﬁve had stable disease (36%). Median\nPFS was 4.1 months and OS 27 months. As hypertension is\na key feature of PPGL and a major adverse event of suni-\ntinib, special attention is required to deal with this issue.\nThere are currently several ongoing trials on sunitinib\nincluding a randomised, placebo-controlled trial testing\nsunitinib in patients with malignant PPGL, now closed for\nrecruitment (FIRST-MAPPP trial, NCT01371201).\nA phase II study with pazopanib involving seven patients\n(study closed because of poor accrual) reported one\nconﬁrmed partial response (17%, duration 2.4 years) and\nmedian PFS and OS of 6.5 and 14.8 months, respectively.91\nRecommendations\nACC\n\u0003 In most patients with metastatic ACC, ﬁrst-line therapy\nwith mitotane alone or mitotane plus ChT is recommen-\nded; EDP-M is the ﬁrst-line treatment of choice [I, A].\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. low tumour burden and/or\nmore\nindolent\ndisease),\nmitotane\nmonotherapy\nis\nreasonable.\n\u0003 Surgery and locoregional therapies should be adopted in\naddition\nto\nsystemic\ntherapy\nin\nselected\npatient\npopulations.\n\u0003 Surgery is the treatment of choice only if all tumoural le-\nsions can be removed [V, B].\n\u0003 Local therapies (e.g. RT, RFA, cryoablation, microwave\nablation, chemoembolisation) are of value for therapy\nin advanced ACC, and an individualised treatment\napproach is required [V, B].\nPPGL\n\u0003 Although there are no curative treatment options, treat-\nment choices include watch-and-wait, locoregional ther-\napies, radiopharmaceutical agents, systemic ChT and\nmolecular-targeted therapies.\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. with low tumour burden\nwithout relevant symptoms), a watch-and-wait policy\n(including alpha blocker to control hypertension) is\npreferred.\n\u0003 In all patients with metastatic PPGL (debulking) surgery\nshould be considered.\nM. Fassnacht et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 11\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099\n1487\n\n---\n\u0003 In patients with relevant symptoms, high tumour\nburden or progressive disease, locoregional therapies,\nradiopharmaceutical agents (e.g. [123I]MIBG [III, A] or\nradiolabelled somatostatin analogues [V, B]) or systemic\nChT [IV, B] should be applied in a case-by-case manner.\nThe follow-up of patients with inoperable disease\nshould be carried out every 3-6 months during the ﬁrst\nyear (imaging plus metanephrines) and then adjusted\nafterward.\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nStudies focusing on strategies for surveillance are lacking for\nACC and PPGL. In these guidelines, we follow the recom-\nmendations provided recently by other groups.4,9 For locally\nadvanced or metastatic disease, OS and time-to-progression\nare the most important end points, response rate and\ntreatment toxicity providing secondary end points. Time-to-\nprogression, ORR and treatment toxicity guide clinical\ndecision making in individual patients; they should be\nevaluated at regular intervals during treatment using CT\nscans and/or MRI and laboratory results (supplementary\nFile, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). For patients opting for entirely palliative manage-\nment, no systematic imaging is advised. Information on\nlong-term implications, patient experience, psychological\nimplications and effect of rehabilitation is lacking for ACC\nand PPGL. At least, speciﬁc management of survivors should\nbe based on individual needs and preferences.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines have been produced by\nESMO in partnership with EURACAN, the European Refer-\nence Network for rare adult solid cancers. These Clinical\nPractice Guidelines were developed in accordance with the\nESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical Practice\nGuidelines development (http://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/\nESMO-Guidelines-Methodology). They are conceived to\nprovide the standard approach to diagnosis, treatment and\nsurvivorship on ACC and PPGL. Recommended interventions\nare intended to correspond to the ‘standard’ approaches,\naccording to current consensus among the European\nmultidisciplinary experts in the management of these\nextremely rare diseases. These are represented by the\nmembers of the ESMO Faculty and experts belonging to the\nEndocrine Tumour domain of EURACAN, the ENSAT and the\nEuropean Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions\n(Endo-ERN).\nExperimental interventions considered to be beneﬁcial\nare labelled as ‘investigational’. Other nonstandard ap-\nproaches may be proposed to the single patient as ‘options’\nfor a shared patientephysician decision in conditions of\nuncertainty, as long as some supporting evidence (though\nnot conclusive) is available. Algorithms accompany the text,\ncovering the main typical presentations of disease, and are\nmeant to guide the user throughout the text. The relevant\nliterature has been selected by the expert authors. Levels of\nevidence and grades of recommendation have been applied\nusing the system shown in supplementary Table S10,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099.92 Statements without grading were considered justi-\nﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts. This manu-\nscript has been subjected to an anonymous peer review\nprocess.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe ESMO Guidelines Committee thank the ESMO Faculty\nand other experts who provided critical reviews of these\nESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines.

They help health pro-\nfessionals weigh the beneﬁts and the risks of available diagnostic\nor therapeutic options. Randomised clinical trial (RCT) data on\nthe management of thyroid cancer (TC) are relatively scarce, and\nthe quality of available evidence is suboptimal. Retrospective\nanalyses of treatment efﬁcacy frequently show favourable out-\ncomes, but it is difﬁcult to discern the extent to which these\nresults are due to the natural history of the disease. The number\nof cases retrospectively analysed is not an index of the quality of\nthe data or the absence of biases. Consequently, large, well-\nplanned RCTs managed within a network of coordinated centres\nare urgently needed.\nThe main goals of any cancer treatment are to improve overall\nsurvival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Persistent disease in low-\nrisk TC patients is often associated with prolonged survival. The\nindolent behaviour of the tumours in these individuals—the vast\nmajority of the patients seen by clinicians—argues for the use of\nless aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches than those\nreserved for higher-risk patients. Therefore, clinical practice\nguidelines are also intended to provide oncologists with cost-\neffective strategies that will minimise the risks associated with\novertreatment.\nIncidence and epidemiology\nThe last three decades have witnessed steady, worldwide increases\nin the incidence of TC [1, 2]. Figures from the European Network\nof Cancer Registries show estimated incidence rates among\nfemales in 2012 that were approximately threefold higher than\nthose for males (9.3 and 3.1 cases per 100 000 person-years, re-\nspectively) [1]. Rates vary widely from country to country, with\nthe highest ﬁgures (per 100 000 person-years) reported in\nLithuania (15.5), Italy (13.5), Austria (12.4), Croatia (11.4) and\nLuxembourg (11.1). Estimated TC-related mortality rates, by\ncontrast, are low (0.7 and 0.5 cases per 100 000 person-years for\nwomen and men, respectively) with considerably less regional\nand temporal variation [3].\nThe rising incidence rates are almost entirely due to the\nincreased diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) and\npapillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) in particular. Incidence rates for\nfollicular (FTC), anaplastic (ATC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid\ncancers have remained relatively stable over the past 30 years. The\nexpanding use of imaging techniques, biopsy procedures [e.g.\nﬁne-needle aspiration (FNA)] and medical surveillance, along\nwith improved access to healthcare, has facilitated the detection\nof small, subclinical PTCs [4]. The resulting overdiagnosis has in-\nvariably been accompanied by overtreatment [5]. According to\nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force, the risks associ-\nated with TC screening in asymptomatic adults are likely to\nV\nC The Author(s) 2019.

Support is also growing for\nmore conservative, risk-tailored strategies for TC management\n(including watchful waiting) [7–10].\nDTC and poorly differentiated TC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nThe diagnostic work-up of DTCs (including poorly differentiated\nforms) comprises pre- and postoperative pathological and mo-\nlecular assessments. Preoperative FNA for cytology is not\nrequired for nodules measuring \u00021 cm. Decisions to aspirate\nlarger nodules should be guided by lesion size and sonographic\nappearance [8]. Cytology ﬁndings are classiﬁed into diagnostic\ncategories associated with different risks of malignancy [11].\nMost malignant thyroid tumours can be identiﬁed cytologically.\nNotable exceptions are FTCs and the newly deﬁned ‘non-invasive\nfollicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features’\n(NIFTP), which are usually classiﬁed as indeterminate in the vari-\nous thyroid cytology reporting schemes [12]. FNA-based diagno-\nsis of poorly differentiated carcinoma is also challenging unless\nthere is obviously increased mitotic activity and/or necrosis. FNA\ndiagnosis can be facilitated by assessment of malignancy markers\n(including proteins commonly overexpressed in tumours, e.g.\nHBME1 or galectin-3) and molecular alterations speciﬁcally asso-\nciated with malignancy (e.g. BRAF mutations, RET fusions, other\nnovel gene alterations). Speciﬁcally designed gene panels are re-\nportedly useful for identifying malignancy when cytology sam-\nples are morphologically indeterminate [13].\nResected DTCs are histologically classiﬁed according to the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) criteria (updated in 2017—\nTable 1). Based on clinical evidence of their low-grade behaviour\nduring long-term follow-up, encapsulated non-invasive follicular\nPTC variants are now referred to as NIFTPs. They account for up\nto 20% of cases in Europe [14]. Elimination of the term ‘carcin-\noma’ from the deﬁnition of this PTC variant underscores its ex-\ncellent prognosis: NIFTP is associated with no reports of cancer-\nrelated deaths and an estimated risk of recurrence of <1%. This\nnew entity shows partial overlap with the group of tumours\ndeﬁned in Europe as ‘well-differentiated tumours of uncertain\nmalignant potential’ [15]. Diagnosis of NIFTP requires a scrupu-\nlous pathological examination of the follicular-pattern nodule to\nconﬁdently exclude the presence of capsular invasion (even\nmicroscopic) and papillary formations. RAS but not BRAF muta-\ntions characterise NIFTPs. Correct identiﬁcation of NIFTPs\nshould reduce the unnecessary use of radical surgical procedures\nand the needless administration of radioactive iodine (RAI) after\na completion thyroidectomy. NIFTP follow-up strategies should\nmimic those of very-low risk carcinomas (see following sections).\nThere are numerous other PTC variants, including some that are\nparticularly aggressive and associated with higher tumour stages\nand lymph node metastases at diagnosis. The best-known of these\nare the tall cell, columnar, hobnail and solid variants [16, 17].\nThe WHO currently recommends reporting FTCs as ‘minimal-\nly invasive’ when capsular penetration is present without vascular\ninvolvement (a condition associated with an extremely good\nprognosis). The terms ‘angioinvasive’ and ‘widely invasive’\nshould be reserved for follicular cancers with neoplastic emboli\ninvolving <4 or \u00034 blood vessels, respectively.\nThe diagnostic criteria for poorly differentiated carcinomas re-\nmain controversial. A consensus conference in 2006 yielded the\nTurin proposal [18], which restricts this diagnosis to invasive\ntumours with a solid/trabecular/insular growth pattern plus at\nleast one of the following:\n• mitotic index \u00033 per 10 high-power ﬁelds;\n• necrosis;\n• convoluted nuclei (slightly smaller and darker than those typ-\nically seen in PTC, with irregular contours).\nThis deﬁnition delimits a category of TCs that behave aggres-\nsively while maintaining some degree of functional differenti-\nation [e.g. thyroglobulin (Tg) production].\nHu¨rthle cell carcinomas are no longer classiﬁed as ‘follicular\ntumours’, which are generally much less aggressive and less likely\nto present with lymph node metastases [16]. Hu¨rthle cell carcino-\nmas associated with extensive vascular and/or capsular invasion\nshould be managed like other high-risk carcinomas (see following\nsections). ‘Pure’ Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas (i.e., those with a\nHu¨rthle-cell component exceeding 75%) also present molecular\nabnormalities that distinguish them from conventional follicular\ncarcinomas. As for oncocytic PTCs and oncocytic variants of\npoorly differentiated carcinomas, they are no more aggressive\nthan their conventional counterparts.\nMolecular proﬁling has distinguished two major classes of PTCs\ncharacterised by BRAF-predominant and RAS-predominant mo-\nlecular signatures (Table 1) [19]. BRAF V600E mutations are fre-\nquently reported in a subgroup of PTCs with more aggressive\nclinicopathological behaviours, but the need for routine BRAF gen-\notyping of PTCs has not been established. The fatal forms of non-\nATC are generally PTC variants harbouring BRAF or RAS\nmutations plus other genomic alterations (e.g. mutations involving\nthe TERT promoter, TP53, POLE, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway\neffectors, SWI/SNF subunits and/or histone methyltransferases),\nsome of which are potential therapeutic targets [20]. The molecular\nproﬁles of follicular and Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas are less well-\ndeﬁned. Work is underway to deﬁne the genomic and transcrip-\ntomic proﬁles of poorly differentiated and anaplastic TCs [21, 22].\nStaging and risk assessment\nMortality risk. The Union for International Cancer Control\n(UICC) tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation of malig-\nnant tumours stages lesions based on their mortality risks. The\neighth edition [23] introduced important changes for thyroid\ntumours, including the downstaging of extrathyroidal extension\nthat is not macroscopically evident (pT3b) (Table 2). Primaries\nwith extrathyroidal spread that is exclusively microscopic are\nnow staged solely on the basis of tumour size as pT1, pT2 or\npT3a. TNM staging requires a complete review of prognostically\nrelevant morphological and immune-phenotypic parameters\n[20]. A checklist containing these parameters can be included in\nthe ﬁnal pathology report [IV, A] to supply details on the extent\nof invasion (capsular versus vascular, including number of\naffected vessels), tumour size and architecture, presence of necro-\nsis, proliferative activity, etc. [10].\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1857\n\n---\nRisk of persistent or recurrent disease. Table 3 summarises the\nsystem developed in 2015 by the American Thyroid Association\n(ATA) to estimate the risk of persistent or recurrent TC based on\ndata available shortly after treatment of the primary cancer\n[8, 24–26]. These criteria have now been revised and reﬁned\nbased on emerging evidence. The likelihood of persistent/recur-\nrent disease after an apparently complete resection depends on\nseveral factors. The overall estimated risk of recurrence ranges\nfrom <1% to 55% and is classiﬁed as low (\u00025%), intermediate\n(6%–20%) or high (>20%). A high-quality pathology report is\ncrucial for proper risk stratiﬁcation.\nThe initial risk class assignment is revised during follow-up to\nreﬂect the evolution of the disease and responses to treatments\n(dynamic\nrisk\nstratiﬁcation)\n[IV,\nA]\n[27–30].\nTreatment\nresponses are deﬁned as excellent, biochemical incomplete, struc-\ntural incomplete or indeterminate based on imaging ﬁndings >\n[mainly neck ultrasound (US)] and serum Tg and anti-Tg anti-\nbody (TgAb) levels (see Table 4) [8].\nPrimary tumour management\nSurgery. Primary tumour management will be determined by the\nresults of the preoperative risk assessment (Figure 1). Active US\nsurveillance of the thyroid and neck lymph nodes (every 6–\n12 months) can be proposed for unifocal papillary microcarcino-\nmas (\u000210 mm) with no evidence of extracapsular extension or\nlymph node metastases [III, B] [31]. In these cases, the only\nknown predictor of signiﬁcant tumour growth (\u00033 mm) or the\nonset of lymph node metastasis is age (10-year estimated risks:\n36% in patients <30 years old, 14% in those aged 30–50, 6% in\npatients 50–60 years old) [32].\nFor other TCs, total thyroidectomy is still considered the stand-\nard surgical treatment. Two large database studies on surgical man-\nagement strategies found that, for selected low-risk tumours (T1a–\nT1b–T2, N0), lobectomy alone does not reduce OS [IV, B] [33,\n34], but it may be associated with a slightly higher local recurrence\n[8]. However, even large database studies are subject to biases. In\nrisk-beneﬁt analyses, it is important to recall that total thyroidec-\ntomy can cause recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.5%, bilateral in\nrare cases) and temporary or permanent hypoparathyroidism\n(8.1%) [35]. The risk (even when done by high-volume surgeons)\nis almost twice that of lobectomy alone, and postoperative compli-\ncations are generally more likely with low-volume surgeons [36].\nThe use of prophylactic central neck dissection for low-risk\ntumours (T1b–T2, N0) varies from centre to centre [IV, C]\n[37–39]. Evidence of its effect on recurrence-free survival is con-\nﬂicting, and there is no high-level evidence for or against its use-\nfulness for low-risk tumours. Studies supporting prophylactic\nneck dissection for low-risk tumours have shown moderate\nreductions in central neck recurrence (5%–10%) but no im-\nprovement in OS. Prophylactic neck dissection does allow more\ncomplete staging of neck nodes, including identiﬁcation of\nmicrometastases not visible on preoperative US, and this infor-\nmation can be used to reﬁne the prognosis and guide subsequent\ntreatment and follow-up. Risks, however, include temporary\nhypoparathyroidism and overdiagnosis and overtreatment of\nsubclinical micrometastases. The potential beneﬁts of prophylac-\ntic neck dissection for low-risk tumours are now being evaluated\nin an RCT (NCT03570021—ESTIMABL3). For more invasive\ntumours (T3–T4), prophylactic neck dissection may improve re-\ngional control [IV, C] [40].\nRAI therapy. RAI is administered after total thyroidectomy for\nseveral reasons:\n• to eliminate the normal thyroid remnant, thereby ensuring\nundetectable serum Tg levels (in the absence of neoplastic tis-\nsue), which facilitate follow-up (remnant ablation);\n• to irradiate presumed foci of neoplastic cells, thereby reduc-\ning the recurrence risk (adjuvant therapy); and/or\nTable 1.

For minimally invasive Hu¨rthle cell carcinoma, robust data are lacking on the true risk of recurrence.\nfThe BRAF V600E mutation is associated with aggressive histologic features, lymph node metastases and ETE, but its relative contribution to the risk of recur-\nrence is not well-deﬁned. Co-existing BRAF V600E and TERT mutations act synergically to increase the risk of recurrence [25, 26].\n131I, iodine-131; ATA, American Thyroid Association; DTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; ERR, estimated risk of recurrence; ETE, extrathyroidal extension; FTC,\nfollicular thyroid cancer; NIFTP, non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features; PTC, papillary thyroid cancer; RAI, radioactive\niodine; Tg, thyroglobulin; WHO, World Health Organization.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1860 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\n• to treat persistent or recurrent disease (treatment of known\ndisease) [8].\nIn all three cases, RAI administration must be followed by an\niodine-131 (131I) whole-body scan (WBS) to stage the disease\nand document the 131I avidity of any structural lesion. The esti-\nmated level of risk for persistent/recurrent disease will deter-\nmine whether and how much RAI is given. Low activities are\nusually given for remnant ablation (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq); high\nactivities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) are used for treatment pur-\nposes. To optimise isotope uptake, RAI should be given after\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation, which can be\nachieved by withdrawing levothyroxine for 4–5 weeks, ideally\nuntil serum TSH levels reach \u000330 mIU/ml. Alternatively, re-\ncombinant human TSH (rhTSH) can be given (two daily injec-\ntions of 0.9 mg of rhTSH followed by RAI on day 3). The\nresulting TSH level is not usually measured (unless doubts arise\nas to whether the injections have been properly administered).\nLevothyroxine withdrawal is preferred if distant metastases are\npresent. The use of rhTSH is associated with superior short-\nterm QoL [41].\nAs shown in Figure 2, practice guidelines unanimously recom-\nmend treatment with high RAI activities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq)\nfor patients with high risk of recurrence [IV, A] [7–10, 42]. RAI\nadministration is not recommended for certain low-risk patients\n[i.e. those with a small (\u00021 cm) intrathyroidal DTC and no evi-\ndence of locoregional metastases] [II, E] [43]. The term ‘very\nlow-risk’ is often applied to these patients in the literature [7, 44].\nThere is less consensus regarding other low-risk DTC patients\n[IV, C] (see Table 3). In 2015, the ATA guidelines advised against\nthe systematic use of RAI in the latter group [8]. However, the\nEuropean Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) has not\nendorsed this recommendation [45], mainly because prospective\nRCT data showing that surveillance is non-inferior to RAI ad-\nministration are lacking. The ATA, the EANM, the Society of\nNuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) and the\nEuropean Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published a\njoint statement acknowledging the absence of high-quality evi-\ndence either for or against the postoperative use of 131I in low-\nrisk patients [46]. They conclude that decisions should be taken\non an individual basis, depending on tumour features (e.g. risk of\nrecurrence) (see Table 3), patient-related factors (e.g. comorbid-\nities, motivation, emotional concerns), health-care setting (e.g.\navailability and quality of thyroid surgeons, US, RAI imaging, Tg\nassays) and the local management team’s preferences. Lastly, the\nexpected beneﬁts of a given RAI dose should outweigh the risks\nassociated with its administration, which include adverse events\n(AEs) and diminished QoL [43]. The usefulness of 131I therapy in\nlow-risk TC patients is now being assessed in two large RCTs\n(NCT01837745—ESTIMABL2,\nNCT01398085—IoN).\nTwo\nother RCTs (ESTIMABL1 and HiLo) conducted in low-risk DTC\npopulations showed that, if RAI is given in these cases, low activ-\nities (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq) following rhTSH and high activities\n(100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) following levothyroxine withdrawal are\nequally likely to produce successful ablation [I, A] [47, 48]. This\nequivalence is also evident at the level of recurrence-free survival,\nTable 4.

RAI adjuvant therapy can\nbe considered for intermediate-risk patients. Decisions on RAI\ndosage and TSH stimulation modalities are based on case\nfeatures—surgical, clinical and pathological (particularly the ex-\ntent of lymph node involvement and the aggressiveness of the\npathological subtype) [IV, B] [43]. If given, low to high activities\n(30 mCi, 1.1 GBq to 100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) are recommended. In\nthese patients, the ATA recommends individualised decision\nmaking [8].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up tools and schedules (Figure 3) vary according to the\ntumour histotype, initial treatment, initial risk of persistent/re-\ncurrent disease (Table 3) and responses to treatment (Table 4).\nSerum Tg assays and neck US are the mainstays of DTC follow-\nup [51]. Patient management can be improved when health pro-\nfessionals collaborate as members of a multidisciplinary team.\nSerum Tg. Serum Tg is a sensitive marker for the presence of thy-\nrocytes, but it cannot discriminate between normal and\nmalignant cells. Undetectable levels thus have high negative pre-\ndictive values, but detectable values can be false-positives. To\nminimise variability, Tg levels should ideally be measured with\nthe same assay [52]. Concomitant assessment of serum TgAb is\nmandatory, as these antibodies can interfere with Tg assays, caus-\ning false-negative or, less commonly, false-positive results [53].\nSerum Tg can be assayed under basal conditions (i.e. during levo-\nthyroxine treatment) or after endogenous (levothyroxine with-\ndrawal) or exogenous (rhTSH injection) TSH stimulation. In\npatients treated with total thyroidectomy plus RAI remnant abla-\ntion, stimulated serum Tg levels <1 ng/ml are highly predictive of\nan excellent response to therapy, and subsequent stimulated Tg\nassays are unnecessary [54]. High-sensitivity (<0.2 ng/ml) assays\nof basal Tg levels can also be used to verify the absence of disease\n(excellent response) [II, B] [55]. If negative imaging ﬁndings are\naccompanied by detectable Tg levels, the treatment response is\nclassiﬁed as indeterminate or biochemical incomplete (Table 4).\nIn this case, the positive predictive value increases with the serum\nTg level or, if serial measurements are available, with levels that\nincrease over time. Almost 60% of patients who have total thyroi-\ndectomy without postoperative RAI administration will have\nbasal serum Tg levels \u00020.2 ng/ml [56, 57], which indicates an\nDTC \nafter TT ± neck dissection\nTherapeutic\nResidual disease (incomplete surgery, M1)\nRAI-refractory diseasea\n1.

When\nserum Tg levels are detectable, serial measurements of Tg should\nbe obtained on levothyroxine treatment [IV, B] [56, 57]. A simi-\nlar approach might be used following lobectomy [IV, C] [28].\nIncreasing Tg levels are highly suspicious for persistent/recurrent\nDTC, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nNeck US. Neck US is the most effective tool for detecting struc-\ntural disease in the neck, particularly when remnants of normal\nthyroid tissue are present. Combined with the results of FNA cy-\ntology [58] and serum Tg assays, neck US ﬁndings can achieve an\naccuracy of nearly 100% [59]. The shortcomings of US include\nsubstantial operator dependency [60], a high frequency of non-\nspeciﬁc ﬁndings [61] and the possibility of unsatisfactory visual-\nisation of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by\nbone or air. The latter sites are better explored with cross-\nsectional imaging modalities (see below). Abnormal US ﬁndings\ncan be classiﬁed as indeterminate or truly suspicious (Table 5)\n[62, 63]. Unlike PTC, FTC metastasis is typically haematogenous\nand rarely involves the locoregional lymph nodes, so neck US in\nthese cases serves mainly to exclude residual/recurrent thyroid-\nbed disease.\nOther imaging studies.

Recommendations for postoperative management of DTC patients.\naIsolated measurements of serum Tg cannot be reliably interpreted in the presence of normal thyroid tissue. The trend over time of basal Tg\nshould be used in patients with residual thyroid tissue and might also be used in case of lobectomy. Rising Tg is highly suspicious for persist-\nent/recurrent disease, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nbHighly sensitive (<0.2 ng/ml) assays of basal Tg can be used in lieu of TSH-stimulated Tg to verify the absence of disease.\ncIn patients with serum TSH level of 0.5–2 mIU/ml after lobectomy, levothyroxine replacement therapy is not mandatory.\ndIn patients with excellent response to therapy, repeat neck US may be avoided.\neShort serum Tg doubling time (<1 year) is associated with poor outcome in DTC patients [72] and should prompt imaging staging.\nfShort tumour growth doubling time (<1 year) may guide the choice of starting a treatment [95].\ngIf FDG is normal, WBS can be carried out after the administration of a therapeutic activity.\nDTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; FDG, ﬂuorodeoxyglucose; FDG–PET, [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomography;\nON-LT4-Tg, thyroglobulin measurement on levothyroxine; q x months, every x months; RAI, radioactive iodine; rhTSH, recombinant human\nthyroid stimulating hormone; RRA, radioiodine remnant ablation; RxWBS, therapeutic whole-body iodine-131 scan; Tg, thyroglobulin; TgAb,\nserum thyroglobulin antibody; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total thyroidectomy; US, ultrasound; WBS, whole-body scan.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1864 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nTgAb levels in the absence of sonographically identiﬁable neck\ndisease or in patients with intermediate-to-high risks of persist-\nent/recurrent disease, irrespective of the neck US ﬁndings)\n[IV, B] [8].\nA WBS can be carried out after the administration of diagnostic\nor therapeutic doses of RAI. Because its sensitivity is low (27%–\n55%), diagnostic WBS is not indicated during follow-up [IV, A]\n[64]. Uptake is highly speciﬁc (91%–100%) for the presence of\nthyroid tissue, but false-positive results are possible. In these cases,\nsingle-photon emission computed tomography or computed\ntomography (CT) offers better anatomic resolution [64].\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomog-\nraphy (FDG–PET) combined with CT is useful for assessing the\nextent of disease and deﬁning the prognosis [65, 66]. Its sensitiv-\nity is around 94%, and speciﬁcity is between 80% and 84%.\nFDG–PET is more sensitive than therapeutic WBS for detecting\npersistent disease in patients with negative cross-sectional imag-\ning studies, serum Tg levels >10 ng/dl, and/or aggressive histo-\ntypes (e.g. aggressive PTC, poorly differentiated TC, widely\ninvasive follicular carcinoma) [67]. FDG uptake is associated\nwith a worse prognosis and refractoriness to RAI treatment [68,\n69], but it is not a reliable predictor of tumour growth [70].\nFDG–PET is the ﬁrst-line isotopic imaging technique for patients\nwith RAI-refractory disease.\nCross-sectional imaging modalities should be chosen on\nthe basis of the anatomic region to be explored. CT is best for\nneck and chest imaging. Contrast enhancement is used for\nstudies of the neck and mediastinal lymph nodes but not\nfor the lungs. All forms of RAI treatment should be deferred\nfor at least 6 weeks after administration of any iodinated con-\ntrast medium. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imag-\ning (MRI) is appropriate for exploring the neck, liver,\nbones and brain [64]. MRI of the neck is subject to\nsubstantial image degradation due to respiratory motion,\nand a CT scan is often a better alternative. Suspected\naerodigestive-tract involvement should always be assessed\nendoscopically.\nFollow-up strategies. All patients with DTC should have neck US\nand serum Tg and TgAb assays 6–18 months after primary\ntreatment (surgery 6 RAI therapy). The subsequent follow-up\nschedule will depend on the initially estimated risk of persistent/\nrecurrent disease and responses to therapy (Figure 3).\nPTC patients at low risk for recurrence who have no evidence\nof structural disease at the ﬁrst follow-up visit can be monitored\nwith periodic (12–24 months) Tg and TgAb assessments. Repeat\nneck US scans can be carried out as needed, depending on serum\nTg and TgAb levels [71]. The same schedule can be adopted for\nintermediate-risk PTC patients with excellent responses to treat-\nment [IV, A] [27, 30, 44]. TSH levels should be maintained in the\nlow-normal range (0.5–2 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. The follow-up\nprotocol for minimally invasive FTCs is often the same one used\nfor low-risk PTCs, although the evidence supporting such an ap-\nproach is insufﬁcient [V, C] [24].\nLow- or intermediate-risk PTC patients with a biochemical in-\ncomplete or indeterminate response to treatment should have\nserum Tg and TgAb assays and a neck US every 6–12 months.\nRising Tg or TgAb levels warrant further imaging studies [72].\nMild TSH suppression should be considered (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) in\npatients at intermediate risk of recurrence [IV, B] [8].\nIn patients with high-risk PTCs, poorly differentiated TCs or\nwidely invasive FTCs, serum Tg and TgAb levels should be\nassessed every 6–12 months if the response to therapy is excellent\nor biochemical indeterminate/incomplete. Cross-sectional or\nfunctional imaging studies should be repeated if detectable Tg\nlevels persist [IV, B] [27, 30]. For patients whose recurrence risk\nis initially classiﬁed as high, a more in-depth imaging work-up\nmay be advisable even if serum Tg levels remain or become un-\ndetectable, as the absence of the circulating Tg may simply reﬂect\nthe dedifferentiation of any residual tumour tissue that might be\npresent [8]. Serum TSH levels should be suppressed in all patients\nwith biochemical incomplete or indeterminate responses to treat-\nment (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. Patients with structural in-\ncomplete responses can be placed on active surveillance or\nreferred for local or systemic treatments.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nDistant metastases occur in fewer than 10% of patients with\nDTC. Half are present when the tumour is ﬁrst discovered; the\nothers are found later, sometimes decades after initial treatment.\nMetastases are observed most frequently in patients with aggres-\nsive histological subtypes (e.g. tall-cell, hobnail, solid, diffuse\nsclerosing and columnar-cell variants): vascular invasion, large\nprimary tumours, macroscopic extrathyroidal extension, bulky\nlocoregional nodal disease [8]. The most common sites are lungs\nand bones (involved in 49% and 25% of all cases, respectively),\nand in 15% of cases, both are affected [73]. Bone metastases are\nmore common in FTC than in PTC (55.5% versus 31.5%, re-\nspectively). Spinal (34.6%) and pelvic (25.5%) bones are the\nmost frequently involved, followed by those of the chest (18.3%),\nextremities\n(10.2%),\nshoulder\ngirdle\n(5.4%)\nand\nthe\nTable 5.

Brain, liver and skin in-\nvolvement is less common. The overall mortality rates 5 and\n10 years after diagnosis of distant metastases are 65% and 75%,\nrespectively [75].\nDistant metastases are usually diagnosed because of clinical\nsymptoms or suspicious imaging/laboratory ﬁndings (abnormal\nuptake on a post-ablation WBS, or a positive ﬁnding on an FDG–\nPET-CT scan or a cross-sectional study prompted by elevated Tg\nlevels in patients whose post-ablation WBS is negative).\nRAI therapy. Patients with distant metastases should receive 100–\n200 mCi (3.7–7.4 GBq) of 131I after TSH stimulation [IV, A] [73].\nThe latter can be achieved with levothyroxine withdrawal or, if\nwithdrawal is clinically contraindicated or the patients has hypo-\npituitarism, with injections of rhTSH (Figure 2). One-third of\npatients have lesions that are not RAI-avid and are considered\nRAI-refractory [IV, A] (Figure 2) [73, 76]. If the distant metasta-\nses are RAI-avid, 131I is administered every 6 months for 2 years\nand less frequently thereafter. Between treatments, suppressive\ndoses of levothyroxine are given to maintain serum TSH levels\nbelow 0.1 mIU/ml (unless there are speciﬁc contraindications)\n[III, B] [77–79]. Data from some prospective cohort studies sug-\ngest that disease progression, recurrence and death rates are\nreduced in patients undergoing TSH suppression for structurally\nidentiﬁable disease [77, 79], but it is still unclear how much sup-\npression is appropriate [78]. Between treatments, efﬁcacy should\nbe veriﬁed with periodic cross-sectional imaging studies.\nCompared with repeated administrations of standard doses of\nRAI (100 mCi or 3.7 GBq), use of higher, dosimetrically deter-\nmined activities appears to offer no beneﬁts in terms of OS [80].\nWhen distant metastases lose their ability to concentrate RAI or\nstructural progression occurs within 6–12 months after RAI ad-\nministration, the disease is considered RAI-refractory [IV, A]\n(Figure 2) [73, 76]. A cure is unlikely if lesions persist after ad-\nministration of a cumulative dose of 600 mCi 131I, and decisions\non whether to continue RAI therapy will be based on tumour\nburden, RAI-uptake intensity and responses to previous RAI\nadministrations [73].\nOverall, one out of three patients with distant metastases will\nbe cured with RAI and have a near-normal life expectancy [73].\nThese are usually young individuals with well-differentiated TC\nand small non-FDG-avid metastatic lesions. The other patients\nwill at some point be classiﬁed as RAI-refractory; the prognosis in\nthese cases will vary, depending mainly on the tumour burden\nand growth rate. Overall, their 5-year survival is <50%. RAI re-\nfractoriness, however, remains uncommon, with an estimated in-\ncidence of 4–5 cases per million population. Drugs for re-\ninducing or increasing RAI uptake by the tumours are currently\nunder investigation. The selective kinase inhibitors dabrafenib\n[81], vemurafenib [82] and selumetinib [83] can reportedly re-\nstore RAI uptake and tumour responses in selected patients, espe-\ncially in those with small tumour burden and low progression\nrate. Several trials are underway to validate these preliminary data\n(NCT03244956, NCT02456701, NCT02145143, NCT02152995,\nNCT03363347), but thus far, none of the three drugs has been\napproved for this indication.\nLocoregional therapy. Several locoregional approaches can be\nused to treat TC. The data and indications discussed below,\nhowever, are based mainly on studies of other solid tumours.\nSpeciﬁc recommendations are lacking for DTC or MTC patients;\ntherefore, the indications for locoregional treatments of these\ntumours will be discussed together. ATC patients will be dis-\ncussed separately, as their poor prognosis is a major factor in all\ntreatment decisions.\nBone metastases: The relatively long survival perspective places\nTC patients with bone metastases at high risk of skeletal-related\nevents (SREs), i.e. pathological fractures, spinal cord compres-\nsion, need for radiation (for pain or impending fracture) or sur-\ngery and hypercalcaemia. Up to 37% of TC patients experience\nSREs, and they are associated with poorer prognoses [84, 85].\nThere is a strong rationale and some clinical data supporting\nthe roles for bone resorption inhibitors (bisphosphonates or\ndenosumab) [V, B], external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or other\nlocoregional treatments in reducing SREs [86]. Bisphosphonates\nand denosumab have each been shown to decrease SRE rates and\nbone pain associated with breast, prostate and lung cancers.\nInhibition of bone resorption should be considered in TC\npatients with multiple bone metastases. Treatment can be admin-\nistered every 4 weeks (bisphosphonates and denosumab) or every\n3 months (bisphosphonates). The optimal duration of treatment\nis unknown, but in other more thoroughly studied tumours (e.g.\nbreast, prostate, lung), a minimum of 2 years is recommended.\nAdequate calcium and vitamin D levels should be maintained\nduring treatment. The most signiﬁcant AE of these drugs is jaw\nosteonecrosis, and the risk is increased in patients receiving\nantiangiogenic therapy [87]. A baseline dental evaluation is\nthus mandatory before starting treatment with bone resorption\ninhibitors, and regular checkups are recommended during\ntreatment.\nIf the bone metastases are RAI-avid, RAI therapy may control\nthe disease for some time and alleviate or delay symptoms, but it\nis unlikely to eliminate these lesions. Locoregional treatments\nmay allow longer progression-free intervals and even cures in\npatients with targetable, oligometastatic bone disease. Surgery\nfollowed by EBRT is associated with the best outcomes, at least\nfor limb lesions [88]. If surgery is not feasible, bone lesions associ-\nated with pain or a high fracture risk should be treated with frac-\ntionated (20 Gy in ﬁve fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions) or\nsingle-fraction (8 Gy) EBRT and/or with interventional radiology\ntechniques, including cementoplasty and thermal ablation [89].\nFor spinal cord compression in a patient whose life expectancy\nexceeds 6 months, longer fractionation schedules (e.g. 30 Gy in 10\nfractions over 2 weeks) are recommended. If the life expectancy is\n\u00026 months, a single fraction of 8 or 20 Gy in ﬁve fractions should\nbe used to minimise hospitalisation [II, B] [90].\nPercutaneous vertebroplasty can reduce the pain and deform-\nity associated with vertebral body fractures. The efﬁcacy of this\ninnovative approach has not been directly compared with surgery\nand should only be done in high-volume centres to minimise the\nrisk of complications (e.g. cement leakage outside the bone).\nThere is limited evidence that other conservative techniques\n[radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryotherapy] are effective for\ntreating TC-related bone lesions [V, B] [91].\nPalliative EBRT alleviates pain and neurological complications.\nPain relief is often achieved 48–72 h after treatment, although it\nmay take up to 1 month.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1866 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nLung metastases: The lung is a common site of TC metastasis.\nThe lesions are usually multiple, bilateral, of varying size (from a\nfew millimetres to 1 cm) and asymptomatic. Metastasectomy is\nnot the standard approach for these lesions, but it may be consid-\nered for oligometastasis in patients with good performance status\n(PS) [V, C]. RFA is also a possibility for solitary lesions or those\ncausing a speciﬁc symptom due to their volume and location [V,\nC]. RFA is considered for lesions <2–3 cm in patients not eligible\nfor surgery or those requiring an extensive resection [92].\nLiver metastases: Liver metastases are rare in DTC but more\ncommon in MTC. Liver involvement usually presents with mul-\ntiple lesions, but if true solitary lesions are detected, they may be\ncandidates for local ablation. In MTC patients with a dominant\nlesion that is growing more rapidly than the background dis-\nease, local ablation (e.g. RFA) may be useful for controlling\nsymptoms, systemic ones in particular, such as diarrhoea. The\noutcome of RFA will depend on the size of the lesion (optimally\n<30 mm), its location (at least 3 mm from all vessels) and its\nvisibility on US. Direct comparisons of surgery and RFA are\nlacking. In general, individuals who are ineligible for surgery are\nnot the best candidates for percutaneous ablation. If both sur-\ngery and RFA are contraindicated, hepatic intra-arterial embol-\nisation with drug-eluting beads might be an option: it has been\nused in other solid tumours [93] but its efﬁcacy in TC has not\nbeen validated.\nInvasion of upper aerodigestive tract: Invasion of the upper\naerodigestive tract should always be excluded in TC patients with\nlocoregional disease. Suspicious symptoms include haemoptysis\nand dysphagia. Contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI are helpful\nfor exploring suspicious cases, although endoscopy is more de-\nﬁnitive. In selected cases (e.g. bleeding, exophytic lesions), local\ntreatment (e.g. laser excision) is advisable before starting antian-\ngiogenic multikinase inhibitor (MKI) therapy.\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. TSH suppression\n(serum level <0.1 lIU/ml) is recommended for all TC patients\nwith persistent structural disease in the absence of speciﬁc contra-\nindications [III, B] [77]. Not all patients with RAI-refractory dis-\nease require systemic MKI therapy immediately.

Temporal trends in the levels of\nserum tumour markers (e.g. Tg doubling time) can be used to\nsupport and help decision making [95]. Importantly, however,\nan increase in serum Tg levels in the absence of radiologically evi-\ndent disease progression should not be used to select patients\nrequiring systemic therapy. A complete cross-sectional imaging\nassessment of the extent of the disease is mandatory for any treat-\nment decisions. RECIST v1.1 are used to deﬁne target lesions and\nmeasure responses to systemic treatment [94]. The imaging as-\nsessment should be repeated every 3–12 weeks during treatment.\nReductions in serum Tg are expected in responders, but clinical\ndecisions cannot be based on this parameter alone.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Lenvatinib and sorafenib should be\nconsidered the standard ﬁrst-line systemic therapy for RAI-\nrefractory DTC [I, A; ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 scores: 3 for lenvatinib, 2 for sorafenib].\nLenvatinib and sorafenib have been approved by the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) and the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration\n(FDA)\nfor\nprogressive,\nmetastatic,\nRAI-\nrefractory DTC. Both drugs have been investigated in two large,\nrandomised phase III trials (sorafenib in DECISION [96], lenva-\ntinib in SELECT [97]). Head-to-head comparisons of the two\nagents have not been undertaken. They cannot be compared\nbased on their performances in the RCTs cited above, which dif-\nfered substantially in terms of enrolment criteria. Unlike the\nDECISION population, participants in SELECT underwent man-\ndatory assessment of radiological disease progression at entry by\nan independent committee, and pre-treated patients were not\nexcluded. In addition, progression-free survival (PFS) in the pla-\ncebo arm of SELECT was shorter than that of DECISION, which\nalso suggests that the SELECT trial population may have had\nmore advanced or more active disease than that of the\nDECISION study.\nIn the DECISION trial, 417 patients were randomised (1 : 1)\nto treatment with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo,\nwith crossover permitted at disease progression [96]. The study\ndemonstrated that sorafenib signiﬁcantly prolongs PFS [me-\ndian PFS (mPFS) 10.8 versus 5.8 months with placebo, hazard\nratio (HR) 0.59, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.45–0.76,\nP ¼ 0.001]. Objective responses (all partial) occurred in 12% of\nthe sorafenib group and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients\n(P < 0.0001). The median response duration was 10.2 months\n(95% CI 7.4–16.6). Stable disease lasting \u00036 months (post hoc\nanalysis) was observed more frequently with sorafenib (82/196\npatients, 41.8% versus 67/202 patients, 33.2% in the placebo\ngroup). Disease control (partial response or disease stability\nlasting \u00036 months; post hoc analysis) was achieved in 106/196\npatients (54.1%) treated with sorafenib and 33.8% (68/201\npatients) of those receiving placebo (P < 0.0001). Most patients\n(71.4%) receiving placebo crossed over to sorafenib, and 20.3%\nof patients in sorafenib arm and 8.6% of patients in placebo\narm received additional therapies. OS was similar in the two\narms (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54–1.19, P ¼ 0.14), and the median\nOS (mOS) had not been reached at the data cut-off (31 August\n2012). The median durations of treatment were 10.6 months\n(interquartile range 5.3–15.7) with sorafenib and 6.5 months\n(3.3–12.9) with placebo.\nIn the SELECT trial, 392 patients were randomised 2 : 1 to re-\nceive lenvatinib or placebo [97]. The study met the primary aim,\ndemonstrating that lenvatinib signiﬁcantly prolonged PFS com-\npared with placebo, as ﬁrst-line therapy (mPFS 18.3 versus\n3.6 months in the placebo arm, HR 0.21, 99% CI 0.14–0.31,\nP < 0.001) and in pre-treated patients (mPFS 15.1 months). The\n6-month PFS rates were 77.5% (lenvatinib group) and 25.4%\n(placebo group). Responses to lenvatinib (complete in four cases)\nwere observed in 64.8% patients (compared with 1.5% in the pla-\ncebo group) (OR 28.87, 95% CI 12.46–66.86, P < 0.001).\nResponses occurred rapidly (median time to objective response:\n2 months, 95% CI 1.9–3.5).

In this trial, TC appeared to be\nmore aggressive in older people, as reﬂected by the mOS\nof 18.4 months (95% CI 13.3–20.3) reached in placebo-treated\npatients >65 years compared with that in younger subjects, which\nhad not been reached when the results were published [99].\nThe optimal sequence of MKIs in RAI-refractory DTC cannot\nbe determined based on currently available evidence. Previous\nMKI therapy is not a contraindication for subsequent use of\nthese drugs, but data on second-line efﬁcacy are scarce [II, C].\nMKIs should be continued until the disease progresses, un-\nacceptable toxicities occur or the patient asks to stop treatment.\nIn the presence of single-site progression, locoregional treatment\n(e.g. EBRT, embolisation, percutaneous treatment modalities)\ncan be done for local control, without discontinuing MKIs [V,\nC]. Data on real life experiences with lenvatinib in DTC patients\nare now available and as expected, the drug’s efﬁcacy was not as\ngood as that observed in highly selected RCT populations [100,\n101]. Other antiangiogenic agents have been tested as ﬁrst-line\ntherapy in phase II trials, with widely varying response rates\n(Table 6) [102–110]. None of these agents has been approved yet\nfor RAI-resistant DTC. MKIs with speciﬁc targets [e.g. BRAF,\ntropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK)] have also been used.\nVemurafenib has reportedly displayed activity against BRAF\nV600E TCs in both MKI-naive [overall response rate (ORR)\n38.5%, 95% CI 20.2–59.4] and pre-treated patients (ORR 27.3%,\n95% CI 10.7–50.2) [81, 111]. Larotrectinib has been recently\napproved by the FDA and the EMA for all paediatric and adult\ncancers expressing the TRK gene fusion protein. Partial\nresponses were observed in all ﬁve TC patients treated with this\ndrug in a recently reported phase I/II trial [112]. There is a bio-\nlogical rationale for treating advanced TCs with antiangiogenetic\nagents plus immune checkpoint inhibitors [113], and an RCT is\ncurrently underway to assess the activity of lenvatinib plus pem-\nbrolizumab in this setting (NCT02973997).\nAEs of MKIs: AEs occurred in 98.6% of patients receiving sora-\nfenib during the DECISION trial [96]: hand–foot syndrome,\ndiarrhoea, alopaecia, rash or desquamation, fatigue, weight loss\nand hypertension were the most common. Serum TSH levels\nexceeding 0.5 mIU/ml were observed in 33.3% patients (69/207)\nin the sorafenib arm. TSH increases are a recognised AE of sorafe-\nnib and other MKIs, and levels should be checked monthly to en-\nsure that suppression is maintained.\nSerious AEs were documented in 37.2% (77/207) of the\nsorafenib-treated participants. Nine developed a second malig-\nnancy: squamous-cell skin cancer in seven cases (one patient also\nhad melanoma), acute myeloid leukaemia and bladder cancer in\nthe remaining two cases. Skin cancer is a consequence of sorafe-\nnib’s paradoxical activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase\nsignalling in keratinocytes harbouring mutated or activated RAS.\nIn clinical practice, skin cancer can be resected surgically with\ncurative intent and sorafenib continued, but monitoring and\nearly intervention for skin lesions is essential. The high rate of\nAEs inevitably diminishes treatment compliance. In DECISION,\nwhere the mean daily dose was 651 mg, AEs frequently led to\ntreatment interruptions (137/207 patients, 66.2%), dose reduc-\ntions (133 patients, 64.3%) or drug withdrawals (39 patients,\n18.8%).\nIn SELECT, at least one side-effect also occurred in all\nlenvatinib-treated patients [114], the most common being hyper-\ntension, diarrhoea, fatigue, proteinuria, rash and hand–foot syn-\ndrome. Treatment interruptions (82.4% of patients) and dose\nreductions (67.8%) led to a mean daily lenvatinib dose of 17.2 mg\n[97]. AEs generally occurred during the ﬁrst few weeks of treat-\nment and decreased rapidly after treatment is interrupted. A trial\ncomparing lenvatinib starting doses of 24 versus 18 mg is current-\nly recruiting (NCT02657369). More selective agents such as laro-\ntrectinib for TRK fusion-positive cancers and highly selective\nRET inhibitors (e.g. LOXO 292, BLU 667) have better toxicity\nproﬁles. Off-target side-effects are uncommon with these drugs,\nand toxicities are mild and manageable, mostly of grades 1 and 2\n[112, 115].\nPhysicians, patients and caregivers should be aware of these\nAEs. Caught early, they can be effectively managed, but preven-\ntion, when feasible, is always advisable [116]. The aim should be\nto manage the side-effects successfully without resorting to dose\nor treatment schedule adjustments, which can have detrimental\neffects on treatment efﬁcacy. A post hoc analysis of the impact of\ndose interruption on lenvatinib efﬁcacy in SELECT trial partici-\npants revealed that longer interruptions and lower mean dose\nintensities may diminish the potential beneﬁt conferred by the\ndrug [117]. As MKIs may cause fatal harm when administered to\na pregnant woman and may result in reduced fertility in both\nsexes, fertility preservation approaches should be discussed be-\nfore treatment starts [118].\nConventional cytotoxic therapy: The results of chemotherapy\n(ChT) administration (e.g. doxorubicin) in RAI-refractory DTC\nare disappointing; therefore, it is not recommended unless MKI\ntherapy is contraindicated.\nATC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nATCs are very rare tumours that usually present at an advanced\nstage, display extremely aggressive behaviour, and are associated\nwith a very poor prognosis. They are morphologically heteroge-\nneous and must be distinguished from other neck tumours,\nincluding squamous carcinoma of the larynx, sarcomas and lym-\nphomas. Preoperative biopsy assessment includes diagnostic\nimmunomarkers that can differentiate ATC from large cell\nlymphoma or pleomorphic sarcoma. The molecular proﬁle of\nATC includes mutations of the TERT promoter (associated with\nBRAF or RAS mutations) and TP53 [21, 22], as well as targetable\nabnormalities (e.g. NTRK and ALK rearrangements).\nStaging and risk assessment\nIn the eighth edition of the UICC TNM staging system [23], diag-\nnosis of ATC is no longer associated with pT4 stage by default.\nCases treated with resection are staged like other TC histotypes,\nbased on tumour size and extension (Table 2).\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1869\n\n---\nATCs are considered one of the most aggressive solid tumours\nin humans. The median survival after the initial diagnosis is\n\u00054 months and only one out of ﬁve patients survives more than\n12 months (1-year survival rates: 10%–20%). Long-term survival\nhas been reported, but the estimated rate at 10 years is <5%. The\ndismal prognosis stems from the fact that over 40% of the\npatients present at diagnosis with large primary tumours (mean\nsize: 6 cm), gross extrathyroidal extension and locoregional and\ndistant metastases, which make complete resection unlikely\n[119]. A thorough imaging work-up should be carried out soon\nafter the diagnosis. The FDG–PET-CT scan is the most sensitive\ntool for documenting the extent of disease.

ATC is rarely amenable to complete resection (Figure 5).\nTotal thyroidectomy with bilateral central neck dissection may be\ncarried out in those very rare cases of localised ATC in M0\npatients. Extensive resection with total laryngectomy, oesopha-\ngectomy and/or resection of the great vessels has been reported in\nhighly selected cases in specialised centres, but postoperative\nmortality and morbidity are high and there is no high-level evi-\ndence to indicate that this approach improves survival. The prog-\nnosis is also unaffected by incomplete palliative resection (R2) or\n‘debulking’, which is not generally recommended [IV, E] [121].\nTracheostomy may be needed to alleviate symptoms in patients\nwith moderately progressive disease, but the impact of tracheos-\ntomy on QoL must be considered. Given the technical complex-\nity, the procedure is generally done under general anaesthesia. An\nexperienced team of surgeons and anaesthesiologists is essential,\nas is a complete preoperative cross-sectional imaging assessment\nof the trachea and tumour.\nRadiotherapy. Optimal outcomes in terms of survival and local\ndisease control in ATC require complete or near-complete [no\nresidual tumour (R0) or microscopic residual tumour (R1)] re-\nsection followed by high-dose EBRT, with or without concomi-\ntant ChT [V, A] [122, 123]. However, this multimodal approach\ncan strongly impact QoL and should be reserved for carefully\nselected patients to ensure clinical beneﬁt. Timely discussion\nwithin a multidisciplinary team setting is strongly recommended\n[V, A] (Figure 5).\nAnalysis of 1200 ATC cases in a large national database [121]\nrevealed signiﬁcantly better outcomes when multimodality\ntherapy included radical surgery (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.28–0.43,\nP < 0.0001 versus no surgery or palliative surgery), 40 Gy of\nEBRT (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38–0.56, P < 0.0001 versus no ERBT\nor <40 Gy EBRT) and ChT of any type (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52–\n0.76, P < 0.0001 versus no ChT). Outcomes also varied with\nUICC stage. For stage IVA disease, the beneﬁt from additional\ntherapies was nonsigniﬁcant. For stage IVB disease, however,\nradical surgery followed by both EBRT and ChT signiﬁcantly\nimproved cause-speciﬁc survival compared with radical sur-\ngery alone or with EBRT (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25–0.81,\nP ¼ 0.0083).\nA meta-analysis of 17 retrospective studies including 1147\npatients looked at the impact of postoperative radiotherapy\n(PORT) after radical ATC resection and found that it signiﬁcant-\nly reduced the risk of death as compared with radical resection\nalone (HR 0.556, 95% CI 0.419–0.737, P < 0.001) [124].\nExploratory analyses demonstrated that PORT might also confer\na survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IVA (HR 0.364,\nP ¼ 0.012) or IVB (HR 0.460, P ¼ 0.059) disease but not for stage\nIVC. For best outcomes, PORT must be delivered as soon as pos-\nsible after surgery [IV, A], but the patient must have recovered\nfrom surgery sufﬁciently to be able to lie ﬂat and tolerate\nimmobilisation.\nBecause of the improved dose distribution and the ability to re-\nduce toxicity, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (RT) is the rec-\nommended approach [IV, C] [125]. There is some evidence of a\ndose–response relation. Outcomes in ATC are improved with\ndoses exceeding 45–50 Gy [126, 127]. An analysis of the United\nStates National Cancer Database showed maximal beneﬁts with\ndoses >60 Gy [128]. Evidence that hyperfractionated accelerated\nRT (i.e. delivery of two or more fractions per day over a shorter\ntreatment time) improved survival over that obtained with con-\nventional fractionation is insufﬁcient, whereas it was clearly asso-\nciated with increased toxicity [129–131].\nFor stage IVA or IVB disease, concomitant ChT (usually with\ndoxorubicin or a platinum agent) has been used. Most of the data\nreported on this approach came from single-institution series\nand the clinical beneﬁts reported have been variable. It has been\nshown that concomitant taxane therapy has radio-sensitising\neffects [132].\nPalliative EBRT: In patients with unresectable disease, EBRT\nhas a role in symptom control [V, C] [133]. The aim is usually to re-\nduce the rate of growth of the neck mass and thereby the pressure\nsymptoms. Fractionation schedules vary according to the individual\npatient (most commonly from 20Gy in ﬁve fractions to 30 Gy in 10\nfractions). These fractionation regimens allow simple beam\narrangements such as parallel opposed or simple three-dimensional\nconformal techniques, so that RT can be started as soon as possible.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. Novel systemic\ntherapies are urgently needed to improve the generally poor out-\ncomes associated with ATC. Clinical trial enrolment should\ntherefore be encouraged for patients with good clinical PS [V, B].\nFor patients ineligible for systemic treatments or clinical trials,\nbest supportive care should be discussed (Figure 5) [133].\nTo date, cytotoxic ChT has been the primary treatment for\nmetastatic disease, but it is associated with very low response rates\nand signiﬁcant toxicities [133]. Recommended regimens consist\nof single-agent therapy with paclitaxel or doxorubicin or com-\nbined treatments (e.g. carboplatin/paclitaxel, docetaxel/doxo-\nrubicin) administered weekly or every 3–4 weeks [134–136]. No\ndata are available to guide decisions on second-line therapy\n[133]. Chemoradiotherapy can be considered for local control of\nunresectable stage IVB disease, ideally with weekly administra-\ntion of radio-sensitising ChT (see above).\nSeveral novel approaches (targeted therapy, immunother-\napy) are being studied, alone or in combination, to improve\nthe poor response rates achieved with current strategies. The ef-\nﬁcacy of lenvatinib in ATC is controversial. In 2015, the\ndrug was approved by the Japanese regulatory agency for treat-\nment of TCs, including ATC, based on data from a single-arm,\nopen-label, phase II study conducted on a population of 51\npatients [137], 17 of whom had ATC. The primary aim was to\nestablish the drug’s safety in this setting. The ATC patients had\nan mPFS of 7.4 months (95% CI 1.7–12.9), an mOS of\n10.6 months (95% CI 3.8–19.8) and an objective response rate\nof 24%. These ﬁndings prompted an international, multi-\ncentre, phase II trial, but the trial was stopped early due to futil-\nity (NCT02657369).\nMolecular proﬁling studies have begun to elucidate the mo-\nlecular drivers and the multistep dedifferentiation associated\nwith ATC tumourigenesis [21, 22]. Early mutation of BRAF and\nRAS has been reported in 25% and 28% of the cases, respectively\n[138]. In a phase II, open-label basket trial, patients with BRAF\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1871\n\n---\nV600E-positive malignancies (including 16 with ATC) were\ntreated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily)\nplus the MEK inhibitor trametinib (2 mg once daily). The ORR\nwas 69% (11/16; 95% CI 41%–89%), and the treatment was well\ntolerated [139]. In May 2018, this combination received FDA\napproval for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic\nATC with the BRAF V600E mutation. If available, this should be\nthe ﬁrst-line therapy for advanced BRAF V600E ATC patients\n[V, B]. Other rare mutations and genetic aberrations may also\nprove to be druggable, such as ALK translocations [21, 22].\nExtended molecular proﬁling of ATCs should be strongly\nencouraged as it may reveal promising possibilities for targeted\ntherapies.\nIn the presence of non-druggable mutations, targeting the tu-\nmour microenvironment or common cancer signalling pathways\nis an alternative approach. ATC immunoproﬁling has revealed\nhigh numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes in the tumour\nand tumour cell expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-\nL1) [138]. Immunotherapy with antibodies targeting pro-\ngrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor or PD-L1 has produced\nimpressive results in many malignancies, but few data are avail-\nable on their use in ATC. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody\nspartalizumab was tested in 41 heavily pre-treated patients with\nadvanced ATC, and responses were observed in 19.5%, opening\nthe road to the use of immunotherapy in ATC [140].\nInclusion of targeted therapy, immunotherapy, ChT and/or\nRT,\nadministered\nin\ncombination\nor\nsequentially,\nin\nmultidisciplinary ATC management regimens may improve pa-\ntient outcomes (NCT03181100).\nMTC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nMTC is morphologically heterogeneous and can mimic virtually\nall other primary thyroid tumours. Demonstration of calcitonin\n(Ctn) expression is mandatory for the diagnosis. Rare primary\nCtn-negative neuroendocrine carcinomas of the thyroid exist\nand must be distinguished from metastases from neuroendo-\ncrine neoplasms of the lung. In these cases, carcinoembryonic\nantigen (CEA) determination can be useful, being the only neck\ntumour expressing this marker. The preoperative diagnosis\ncan also be challenging in the absence of a consistent\nimmunophenotype.\nRET and RAS proto-oncogene mutations are detected in\n\u000590% of MTCs and are considered the predominant drivers of\nthese tumours [141]. RET mutations occur sporadically, as som-\natic events, or can be inherited as germline events associated with\nfamilial MTC or the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes\ntype 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B). A quarter of MTCs occur\nas part of an inherited syndrome, and germline RET mutations\nare present in up to 10% of the patients presenting with apparent-\nly sporadic MTCs. All patients with MTC should thus be offered\nMTCa\nCtn <20 pg/ml\nCtn 20–50 pg/ml\nCtn 50–200 pg/ml\nCtn 200–500 pg/ml\nCtn >500 pg/ml\nM0\nM1\nWork-up\n for distant metastases\nTTb \n[IV, B]\nTT ± bilateral CND \n[IV, B] \nNeck surgery based on \ndisease progression \nand symptomsc \n[V, C] \nTT + bilateral CND \n+ ipsilateral LND (at least IIA-III-IV)\n[IV, B] \nTT + bilateral CND \n+ bilateral LND (at least IIA-III-IV)\n[IV, B] \nTT + bilateral CND \n+ bilateral LND (at least IIA-III-IV)\n[IV, B] \nFigure 6.

Strong genotype–phenotype associations\naffecting age at onset (most MTCs occur either in childhood or\nearly adulthood) and tumour aggressiveness have been reported\nfor speciﬁc germline RET mutations. MTCs harbouring somatic\nRET mutations are also commonly associated with more aggres-\nsive behaviour than that of their wild-type RET counterparts. The\nvast majority (91.4%) of sporadic MTCs with distant metastases\nharbour such mutations, in most cases RET M918T (93.8%)\n[144]. There is currently no evidence supporting the value of rou-\ntine screening of MTC patients for somatic RET mutations.\nHowever, if treatment of advanced MTCs with selective RET\ninhibitors is planned, RET testing for somatic mutations is\nneeded to individualise therapy [III, C].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe UICC system is recommended for staging all MTC patients,\nbased on its utility in predicting disease-speciﬁc mortality [IV, A]\n[23]. The eighth edition of this system has introduced some im-\nportant changes in the criteria used for staging thyroid tumours,\nincluding MTCs. Extrathyroidal extension, for example, is now\nimportant only when it is macroscopically evident (pT3b) [23].\nIn the absence of gross extracapsular extension, the primary will\nbe staged solely on the basis of its size (pT1, pT2 or pT3a)\n(Table 2).\nCtn and CEA are valuable diagnostic, prognostic and predict-\nive markers for use with MTC. Their serum concentrations are\ndirectly related to the C-cell mass [145, 146]. Preoperative Ctn\nlevels correlate strongly with tumour diameter and postoperative\nCtn levels. They can also provide useful preoperative information\non the extent of the disease. An analysis of 300 consecutive cases\nof MTC treated with total thyroidectomy and compartment-\noriented lymph node dissections found that preoperative serum\nCtn levels <20 pg/ml (normal reference range: <10 pg/ml) were\nassociated with almost no risk of nodal metastases [147].

Serum Ctn levels exceeding\n500 pg/ml suggest distant metastatic disease and should be\nexplored with additional whole-body imaging procedures.\nSerum Ctn should be measured 60–90 days after thyroidectomy.\nPatients whose postoperative basal serum Ctn level is normal\n(<10 pg/ml) are considered ‘biochemically cured’ and have a 10-\nyear survival rate of 97.7%. However, 3% of patients with normal\nbasal serum Ctn levels following thyroidectomy experience bio-\nchemical recurrence within 7.5 years [143]. CEA is not a speciﬁc\nbiomarker for MTC, and serum assays are not informative for the\nearly diagnosis of MTC. However, they are useful for monitoring\nthe progression of clinically evident MTCs [IV, B] [148–150].\nDoubling times for postoperative serum Ctn and CEA levels\n(deﬁned as the interval of time in which the tumour markers lev-\nels have doubled) are established prognostic markers in MTC\n[IV, B] [148–150]. They are currently considered the best avail-\nable predictors of tumour behaviour, recurrence and cancer-\nrelated death. A Ctn doubling time exceeding 6 months is associ-\nated with 5- and 10-year survival rates of 92% and 37%, respect-\nively; shorter doubling times predict markedly worse survival\n(25% and 8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively) [148]. In patients\nwith poorly differentiated and aggressive MTCs, Ctn values may\nactually decrease over time, whereas CEA levels increase [151].\nDetails on the use of Ctn and CEA doubling times are available\nbelow in the ‘Follow-up, long-term implications and survivor-\nship’ section.\nManagement of local/locoregional disease\nSurgery. Preoperative screening for pheochromocytoma and\nhyperparathyroidism is highly recommended for all patients with\nMTC (except in those already known to have MEN2B) [IV, A]\n[142, 143]. Neck US should be carried out to identify regional\nmetastases; if sonographic (or clinical) ﬁndings are suspicious,\ncontrast-enhanced CT of the neck and chest is indicated. Work-\nup for distant metastases, including chest CT, liver and axial bone\nMRI and 6-ﬂuoro-(18F)-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA)-\nPET scan (if available), should be done if serum Ctn levels exceed\n500 pg/ml or clinical ﬁndings are suspicious. Neck dissection,\nwhen needed, should be done by surgeons with substantial ex-\nperience in TC surgery. The initial approach will depend on pre-\noperative serum Ctn levels and neck imaging ﬁndings (Figure 6)\n[IV, B]. The guidelines in the algorithm are based on retrospect-\nive cohort studies [147, 152]. The grade B recommendation is\nbased on the clinical beneﬁts of elective neck dissection in\npatients with serum Ctn levels <500 pg/ml, for whom surgery\nmay be curative.\nFor carriers of germline mutations, the recommended age for\nprophylactic total thyroidectomy depends on the type of muta-\ntion. Individuals with germline M918T mutations should under-\ngo total thyroidectomy within the ﬁrst year of life. For those with\na C634F or A883F mutation (also considered high risk), surgery\ncan be postponed until age 5 unless Ctn levels increase. Those\nwith other mutations should be monitored from age 5 on with\nCtn assays and neck US, and surgery should be done if Ctn levels\nincrease or if the parents request it [143].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nCtn and CEA monitoring should both be included in the early\nand long-term postoperative staging work-ups [IV, B] [150].\nSerial measurements allow the calculation of doubling times,\nwhich provide useful information as described above. Currently\navailable data indicate that Ctn doubling times should be based\non at least four consecutive measurements, preferably obtained\nover a 2-year period [IV, C] [142, 143]. All measurements must\nbe made by the same laboratory using the same assay. The ATA\nprovides an online calculator for rapid determination of doubling\ntimes from user-supplied series of serum Ctn or serum CEA levels\n[153]. Figure 7 summarises MTC management strategies guided\nby Ctn and CEA levels and doubling times. Clinically relevant dis-\nease sites are rarely detected in patients with Ctn levels <150 pg/\nml, but the likelihood of structural disease increases as Ctn and\nCEA levels rise.\nMultiple imaging modalities should be used to identify locore-\ngional and/or distant metastases [IV, B] [142, 143]. Contrast-\nenhanced whole-body (brain, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis)\nCT with ultra-thin reconstructions is sensitive and speciﬁc\nenough to allow one to estimate the burden of systemic disease\nand to assess and identify target lesions. Target and non-target\nlesions to assess are measured using RECIST v1.1 [94]. Contrast-\nenhanced MRI is more sensitive in identifying liver lesions, which\ncan be misdiagnosed on CT or US as benign cystic lesions. US is\nuseful for assessing neck lymph node involvement, although, as\nmentioned before, it sometimes provides inadequate visualisa-\ntion of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by bone\nor air. For these structures, CT and MRI are more sensitive, pro-\nvide greater morphological detail, and are recommended when\nsurgical interventions, EBRT or other locoregional ablative\napproaches are being planned. MRI is recommended for identify-\ning or excluding brain metastases. Bone scans in MTC patients\nare high in sensitivity but low in speciﬁcity. Whole-body\nbone MRI without contrast medium offers higher speciﬁcity,\nparticularly for osteoblastic lesions. Contrast enhancement is\nrecommended when extraosseous extension or compression\nof the spinal cord or other neurological structures is suspected.\nEndoscopic exploration of the upper digestive tract and\nairways is mandatory whenever there is a high suspicion of\ninﬁltration.\nAs indolent tumours, MTCs generally display low avidity for\nFDG, so FDG–PET–CT is not recommended for their staging,\nbut it can be useful for assessing advanced disease characterised\nby dedifferentiation and rapid progression [151]. FDOPA–PET\nhas high sensitivity and speciﬁcity in MTC [154, 155] and it can\nreveal unidentiﬁed metastases or small lesions, but cost and avail-\nability issues make it unsuitable. Gallium-68 (68Ga) somatostatin\nanalogue PET–CT is relatively insensitive and is not useful for\nstaging, but it does reﬂect expression of somatostatin receptors,\nwhich is useful information when the feasibility of radionuclide\ntherapy is being explored [156].\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1874 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nTable 7.

Disease behaviour varies widely—indolent\nin some cases, rapidly progressive in others—and can be reliably\npredicted by Ctn and CEA doubling times. Advanced MTCs are\ninvariably associated with the secretion of a variety of peptides\n(e.g. prostaglandins, kinins, vasoactive intestinal peptide, sero-\ntonin, histaminase), which can cause unpleasant symptoms such\nas ﬂushing and diarrhoea. Management of these symptoms\nshould be the ﬁrst goal of treatment.\nThe systemic therapies currently approved for MTC have not\nbeen shown to improve OS, so evidence-based guidance is lacking\non when to start these drugs and how patients with indolent\ndisease should be followed. Decisions are based mainly on clini-\ncians’ experience. Multidisciplinary input (e.g. from surgeons,\nendocrinologists, nuclear medicine physicians, medical and radi-\nation oncologists, pain therapists and palliative care specialists) is\nstrongly recommended to ensure optimal care for these patients.\nActive treatment (e.g. locoregional or systemic MKI administra-\ntion) should be considered in the presence of symptoms, lesions\nclose to vital structures, high-tumour burdens or disease progres-\nsion (as deﬁned by RECIST v1.1) [94].\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Cabozantinib [I, A] and vandetanib\n[I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] are the ﬁrst-line systemic treat-\nments for progressive metastatic MTC.

Both drugs inhibit RET kinase activity\nto some extent, and this was the major reason they were originally\nproposed for treating MTC patients. However, their antitumour\neffect is mainly due to their strong inhibition of key angiogenic\npathway components, including vascular endothelial growth fac-\ntor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2).\nThe ZETA trial compared vandetanib (300 mg daily) with pla-\ncebo (2 : 1) in 331 patients with symptomatic and/or metastatic\nMTC [158]. Radiological evidence of disease progression was not\nan enrolment requirement, and placebo-to-vandetanib crossover\nwas allowed if disease progression occurred. The predicted mPFS\nin the vandetanib arm was signiﬁcantly longer than that observed\nin the placebo group (30.5 versus 19.3 months; HR 0.46, 95% CI\n0.31–0.69, P < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the vandetanib\narm (45% versus 13% for placebo, OR 5.48, 95% CI 2.99–10.79,\nP < 0.001), and all but one of the responses in the placebo arm\nwere recorded after crossover to vandetanib. Radiological\nresponses\nwere\naccompanied\nby\nsigniﬁcant\nbiochemical\nresponses (reductions in Ctn and CEA levels in 69% and 52% of\ncases, respectively). Vandetanib exhibited activity independently\nof the tumour’s RET status, previous treatment, metastasis\nsite(s), disease progression status and tumour burden. When the\nZETA data were ﬁrst published, no survival advantage was\nreported for patients managed with vandetanib and no updates\nhave been published since then. In a phase I/II trial of vandetanib\nin children with MTC (two courses at 100 mg/day, then 150 mg/\nday), partial responses were seen in 47% patients, and the AE pro-\nﬁle resembled that observed in adults [160].\nIn the EXAM trial, cabozantinib (140 mg daily) was tested\nagainst placebo (2 : 1) in 330 patients with metastatic MTC [159].\nThe main inclusion criterion was disease progression within the\n14 months preceding study entry. Prior therapy, including MKIs,\nwas allowed, and crossover was not permitted. Compared with\nplacebo, cabozantinib was associated with a signiﬁcantly longer\nmPFS (11.2 versus 4.0 months, HR 0.28, 95% CI, 0.19–0.40,\nP < 0.001) and a higher rate of responses (all partial) (28% versus\n0%, median duration 14.7 months). Efﬁcacy was observed across\nall subgroups, regardless of age, tumour location, tumour bur-\nden, progression rate, prior kinase inhibitor treatment (in 20% of\npatients) or RET/RAS mutation status. mOS rates were similar in\nthe two arms (26.6 versus 21.1 months, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64–\n1.12, P ¼ 0.024), but in the subgroup with RETM918T-positive\nMTCs, cabozantinib was associated with signiﬁcantly longer sur-\nvival (44.3 versus 18.9 months with placebo, HR 0.60, 95% CI\n0.38–0.94, P ¼ 0.03). PFS was consistent with OS in the\nRETM918T-positive\ncases\n(HR\n0.15,\n95%\nCI\n0.08–0.28,\nP < 0.0001) [161].\nAlthough the ZETA and EXAM trials both focused on patients\nwith advanced and/or metastatic disease, their designs and inclu-\nsion criteria were different. The markedly longer mPFS in the pla-\ncebo arm of the ZETA trial—19.3 months [158] versus 4 months\nin EXAM [159]—suggests population differences. Indeed, unlike\nZETA participants, those enrolled in EXAM had to meet RECIST\ncriteria for disease progression and were thus likely to have more\nadvanced disease. The results of the two trials are therefore not\ncomparable, and there is no clear evidence supporting vandetanib\nover cabozantinib as ﬁrst-line treatment. Both are active in ﬁrst-\nand second-line regimens, both prolonged PFS compared with\nplacebo and both displayed RET/RAS status-independent efﬁ-\ncacy. The choice of which drug to use as ﬁrst-line treatment may\nbe based on potential toxicity in each patient (see below).\nHowever, cabozantinib, in a subgroup analysis, demonstrated a\nsigniﬁcant advantage in PFS and OS in patients with RETM918T\nor RAS-mutant MTCs [II, C] [161]. As noted for lenvatinib, re-\ncently released real world data on the efﬁcacy of vandetanib in\nMTC patients are somewhat less encouraging than those gener-\nated in the highly selected population of RCTs [162].\nOther anti-angiogenic MKIs (e.g. sorafenib, motesanib, pazo-\npanib, sunitinib, lenvatinib) have already undergone phase II\ntesting in advanced MTC patients. The most interesting results\nregarded sunitinib and lenvatinib, which were associated with\nresponse rates of 50% and 36%, respectively [157]. Thus far,\nhowever, no MKIs have been approved for second-line use. A\nrandomised trial assessing the efﬁcacy of nintedanib as second-\nline MKI therapy was prematurely closed due to ﬂat enrolment\n(NCT01788982). The more selective RET inhibitors (e.g.\nLOXO-292-NCT03157128,\nBLU-667-NCT03037385)\nappear\npromising and are now under investigation. The RET-\nsuppressing activity of these drugs is essential to their antitu-\nmour effects in MTC, whereas their anti-angiogenic activity is\nnegligible.\nManagement of side-effects: AEs are very common during MKI\ntherapy, and their management is critical for optimising these\ncompounds’ therapeutic ratios. In the ZETA trial, 35% of the\npatients in the vandetanib arm required dose reductions and 12%\ndiscontinued treatment due to toxicity [158]. The most common\nTable 9.

Corrected QT interval\n(QTc) prolongation was a severe, unexpected side-effect in 8% of\ncases. Attempts to reduce the rate of grade 2 or higher AEs with\nan active support programme (including patient contact/visit\nevery 2 weeks and supportive agents such as sunscreen and lo-\nperamide) have been unsuccessful [163]. AEs were also common\nin the EXAM trial, with grade 3 or 4 AEs in 69% of patients\nreceiving cabozantinib. The most common were diarrhoea\n(15.9%), hand–foot syndrome (12.6%) and fatigue (9.3%). Pre-\nexisting disease-related diarrhoea can be worsened by MKI ther-\napy (as a drug-related AE) or improved as a direct effect of the\ndrug’s activity. Increased TSH levels were reported in 57% of the\ncabozantinib-treated patients. TSH levels should be monitored\ncontinuously during treatment, as these patients are generally on\nhormone-replacement therapy if they have undergone total thy-\nroidectomy. Levels should be kept within the normal range: TSH\nsuppression produces no beneﬁts in patients with MTC (unlike\nthose with DTC). AEs associated with VEGF-pathway inhibition\n(e.g. hypertension, haemorrhage, ﬁstula formation, gastrointes-\ntinal\nperforation)\noccurred\nmore\nfrequently\namong\ncabozantinib-treated patients than in those treated with placebo.\nIn the EXAM trial, 79% of patients in the cabozantinib arm\nhad dose reductions, 65% interrupted treatment due to AEs, and\n16% stopped treatment because of toxicities. Randomised trials\nare underway to assess the activities of lower, potentially less\ntoxic doses of vandetanib (150 versus 300 mg, NCT01496313)\nand\ncabozantinib\n(140 mg\ncapsules\nversus\n60 mg\npills,\nNCT01896479).\nThe preliminary results comparing the effects of the two doses\nof vandetanib in patients with advanced MTC have been posted\non ClinicalTrials.gov and showed that the starting dose of 150 mg\nis equally effective as the high 300 mg dose in term of ORR.\nInterruption of treatment and dose reductions are the most\ncommon means for managing AEs. Most decrease in intensity\nafter a few days of withdrawal, but vandetanib AEs may be more\npersistent, given the drug’s 19-day half-life. However, frequent\ninterruptions might reduce the efﬁcacy of MKIs and/or trigger\ncertain escape mechanisms. Most AEs (e.g. hypertension, diar-\nrhoea) are well known and preventable. Useful guidelines for pre-\nventing and managing treatment-related AEs in these complex\ncases have been published by several societies. As for fertility pres-\nervation, the same measures taken for DTC patients are valid for\nthose with MTC.\nConventional\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nradionuclide\ntherapy:\nSystemically administered ChT has historically yielded poor\nresults in MTC. The available data have been generated by retro-\nspective analyses of small, single-institution cases series. The\nmost active drugs have been doxorubicin alone or combined with\ncisplatin, which achieved a response in around 20% at best, or as\na combination with 5-ﬂuorouracil and dacarbazine which did\nnot result in much greater responses [157].\nRadionuclide therapy is an option in selected cases [III, C]. The\nactivity of yttrium-90–DOTA-[D-Phe1-Tyr3]-octreotide (90Y-\nDOTATOC) was tested in a phase II trial including 31 patients\nwith metastatic MTC and increasing Ctn levels. Post-treatment\ndecreases in Ctn levels (the primary endpoint) occurred in 29%\nof the patients treated, and survival beneﬁts were also observed in\nthe responders [164]. RCTs have not been carried out to compare\nthe efﬁcacies of radionuclide and MKI therapies. Ideally, this\ncomparison should be done within a clinical trial setting. In short,\nthere is little evidence to support the use of either ChT or radio-\nnuclide therapy in patients with MTC, although either might be\nconsidered when MKIs are contraindicated.\nMethodology\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in accordance\nwith the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical\nPractice\nGuidelines\ndevelopment,\nhttp://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology.

Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may\nsecrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF\nto functional status.10\nRecommendation\n\u0002 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,\ngrading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and\nsynaptophysin should be reported. SSTR staining or spe-\nciﬁc staining for peptide hormones and amines as well as\nuse of molecular markers is optional and dependent on\nclinical requirements [III, A].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nDisease stage and tumour grade are the two major indepen-\ndent prognostic parameters and should always be assessed\n[III, A]. Since the WHO 2010 classiﬁcation, NENs are graded\nTable 1.

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs. FDG is the tracer of choice\nfor G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose\nmetabolism and less SSTR expression than the low-grade\nNETs, for which the situation is usually the reverse.29 Com-\nbined SSTR imaging and FDG-PET-CT has been shown to be\ncomplementary for lesion detection. Findings of FDG-\npositive NETs at PET-CT indicate worse prognosis.29e31\nThe author panel believes that optimal diagnostic and\nprognostic information can be achieved by submitting all\nNET G2/G3 patients to PET-CT with both FDG and 68Ga-\nTable 3.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic\nradical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph\nnodes can be achieved in \u000480% of cases if carried out by\nexperienced surgeons.40\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locore-\ngional\ndisease\nin\nNET\nG1\nand\nG2.\nBefore\nany\nFigure 2.

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C]. Combining resection and radio-\nfrequency ablation (RFA) may provide the opportunity to\nachieve complete tumour removal, allowing more limited\nM.

However, in aggressive NENs (NEC\nG3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy\n(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are\nwarranted.\nMedical therapy\nThe goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-\nassociated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].\nTreatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-\ntide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning\nNETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved\nin 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations\n[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also\nnamed biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in\nNETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the\nmultiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been\nintroduced more recently in the management of NETs.

SSAs are an established anti-\nproliferative therapy in metastatic GEP-NETs, based on two\nplacebo-controlled trials. Most frequently, they are used in\nﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the\nsettings in which they have been studied. Overall response\nrates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48]. There was a beneﬁt in terms of PFS prolon-\ngation in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56 (0.37e0.8)] and the\nlung NET subgroup [HR 0.5 (0.28e0.88)], and everolimus is\nEMA-approved for NF-GI and lung NETs. Everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive GI NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%).

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.\nThe stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.\nA watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

In\npatients with a Ki-67 of >35%, mPFS was 6.8 months in one\nstudy,101 and in patient subgroups with Ki-67 >55%, mPFS\nwas 6 months, 4 months and 4 months, respectively from\nthe different studies.99,100,102 PRRT may be considered in\npatients with NET G3 [IV, C], however, patients need to be\ncarefully selected and prospective trials are warranted to\nfurther establish which patients with NEN G3 might beneﬁt\nmost from PRRT. The NETTER-2 trial has recently been\ninitiated to address this issue (NCT03972488).\nTreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE is in general considered\nsafe, however, up to 3%e4% of the patients may develop\nirreversible bone marrow toxicity such as leukaemia or bone\nmarrow dysplasia. Mild renal toxicity grade 1/2 has been re-\nported long term in 30% of the patients (see Section 5 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline).\nFor more information about PRRT and SSA combination\nand maintenance therapy, see Section 6 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 A surgical approach is indicated in selected patients\naffected by stage IV GEP-NETs who show exclusive or pre-\ndominant liver disease after careful evaluation of tumour\ngrading, distribution of LMs and primary site [IV, B].\n\u0002 Upfront surgery is not indicated in the presence of extra-\nabdominal metastases and high-grade GEP-NENs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Presence of an advanced NEC G3 is considered an abso-\nlute contraindication for an upfront surgery [IV, A].\n\u0002 Palliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV,\nC]. However, it is controversial if primary tumour\nremoval in patients with stage IV disease translates to\nan improvement in survival.\n\u0002 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-\ntoms in patients affected by metastatic functioning\nSI-NETs [IV, B].\n\u0002 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms\nrelated to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery\nmay be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered\nin patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].\n\u0002 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].\n\u0002 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].\nHowever, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy\nwith platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].\n\u0002 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid\noptions for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with\nother systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.\nThe choice of the procedures depends on the local\nexpertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and\nthe localisation of liver involvement [V, C].\n\u0002 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be\napplied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve\ncontrol of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-\ntions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)\n[IV, A].\n\u0002 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,\nlocoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-\ntive to systemic treatment [IV, B].\n\u0002 Systemic therapy should be administered to control\ntumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth\n[I, A].\n\u0002 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients\nwith CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,\nglucagonoma) [I, A].\n\u0002 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-\ntristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-\nment to SSAs [I, A].\n\u0002 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve\nsymptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of\nIFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].\n\u0002 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].\n\u0002 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires\ncareful information to be given to the patient before and\ndirectly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper\ntreatment [IV, A].\n\u0002 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on\npathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth\nbehaviour and SSTR imaging.\n\u0002 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients\nwith low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable\ndisease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term\nfavourable prognosis.\n\u0002 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for\ntumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing\nSSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,\nA; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. Positive SSTR\nstatus is generally required but is not predictive of\nresponse.\n\u0002 IFN-a can be considered for antiproliferative therapy\nif other treatment options have been exploited or\nare not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative on functional\nimaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where there\nare fewer therapy options compared with Pan-NETs\n[IV, B].\n\u0002 Everolimus is EMA-approved for progressive Pan-NET G1/\nG2 with or without prior ChT, for NF-GI and lung NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In GI NETs, everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive disease [I, A].\n\u0002 The use of everolimus after PRRT is recommended in\nintestinal NETs, if PRRT is available [V, A], although the\ntreatment sequence needs to be further studied in the\nabsence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\n\u0002 The combination therapy of SSA and everolimus for an\nantiproliferative purpose is not recommended [II, D].\nM.

There is\nno established second-line therapy, but different\nregimens [e.g. 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI),\n5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin\n(FOLFOX),\nCAPTEM\n\u0006\nbevacizumab] may be considered [IV, B].\n\u0002 In NET G3, response rates to cisplatin/etoposide are\nlow, and the use of this combination is not recommen-\nded [IV, C].\n\u0002 ChT cannot be recommended in well-differentiated\nslowly growing NETs of the GI tract [II, C]; exceptions\nmay be rapidly progressive tumours or NET G2 with\nhigher Ki-67 close to NET G3 [V, C].\n\u0002 PRRT is recommended as second-line therapy in patients\nwith midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs who\nfulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT [I, A].\n\u0002 177Lu-DOTATATE is EMA- and FDA-approved for patients\nwith midgut NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] and\nPan-NETs [III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4].\n\u0002 In Pan-NETs, PRRT should be used after failure of\napproved therapies [III, A].\n\u0002 In carefully selected patients, PRRT may be considered in\nNET G3 [IV, C].\n\u0002 SSA should be combined with PRRT in patients with\nfunctioning tumours (CS) to prevent increasing symp-\ntoms such as diarrhoea and/or ﬂushing and hormonal\ncrisis soon after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 It is also common practice to continue SSA beyond PRRT\nin functioning tumours, as a full resolution of CS-related\nsymptoms is rarely achieved after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 The combination of SSA with PRRT is not recommended\nin patients with NF-NETs, [IV, C] and it remains unclear if\nSSA should be continued after PRRT as a maintenance\ntherapy.\nPERSONALISED MEDICINE\nIn the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity of\ncomparative\nrandomised\ntrials,\ntherapy\nselection\nin\nadvanced non-resectable disease is frequently based on\nindividual patient clinical and pathological features and\nSSTR imaging [IV, A]. Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence. NSE and\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be monitored in NEC;\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Conventional imaging\nincludes thoracic and abdominal scans every 2e3 months.\nFDG-PET may be required in case of suspected recurrence to\ndiscriminate lesions from unspeciﬁc ﬁndings; otherwise,\nhigh-resolution CT is the imaging method of choice, unless\nresection is considered in locally advanced NEN G3,\nwhere FDG-PET is mandatory to exclude distant metastatic\ndisease.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional\nand SSTR imaging [V, B].\n\u0002 In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1eG2, it is recom-\nmended that imaging is carried out every 3e6 months\n(CT or MRI), and in NEC G3 every 2e3 months [V, C].\nSimilar staging intervals apply to advanced disease.\n\u0002 Follow-up should be lifelong, although the staging inter-\nvals may be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up.\n\u0002 Small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix or rectum do not need any follow-up if\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in\naccordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures\nfor Clinical Practice Guidelines development, http://www.\nesmo.org/Guidelines/ESMOGuidelines-Methodology.\nThe\nrelevant literature has been selected by the expert authors.\nAn ESMO-MCBS table with ESMO-MCBS scores is included\nin supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.107 Levels of evidence and grades of recommenda-\ntion have been applied using the system shown in\nsupplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.108 Statements without grading were considered\njustiﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts and the\nESMO Faculty.

Patients with carcinoids are generally\nyounger, have a better prognosis and do not have a strong\nassociation with smoking, as compared with SCLC and\nLCNEC.1 The incidence of LC is very low, ranging from 0.2-2/\n100 000 persons/year in both the United States and\nEurope.2,3 Numbers are increasing, likely due to increased\nawareness and improved diagnostic techniques, although it\nmay also be a genuine overall increase in incidence.2,3 LCs\naccount for 20%-25% of all NETs and 1%-2% of all lung\ncancers. LCs prevail slightly more often in women than in\nmen. LCs occur during the ﬁfth or sixth decade of life for TC\nand a decade later for AC.4-10\nThC is an extremely rare tumour accounting for an age-\nadjusted rate of 0.02/100 000-0.18/100 000/year in the\nEuropean or USA populations, respectively.3,11 In the\nNetherlands cancer registry or the Surveillance, Epidemi-\nology and End Results (SEER) programme database, <0.5%\nof all neuroendocrine neoplasms were ThC, representing 5%\nof thymic tumours.3,11 The incidence of ThC is increasing in\nthe USA population.11 ThC prevails in men and the mean\nage at diagnosis is 55 years.1,11-13\nLC and ThC may also be present in multiple endocrine\nneoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome or when there is a\nfamily history of carcinoid tumours or diffuse pulmonary\nneuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) (Supplementary\nMaterial,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2021.01.003).1,14-17\nRecommendation\n\u0001 The scarcity of LCs and ThCs justiﬁes the therapeutic\nmanagement of these patients by expert multidisci-\nplinary teams in centres grouped within networks (na-\ntional or European networks) for care and research\noptimisation [V, A].\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nLC is revealed by non-speciﬁc tumour-related respiratory\nsymptoms (mainly, central forms) or incidentally (mainly,\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Note: Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last\nupdate December 2020.

A minority of cases present with symp-\ntoms related to hormonal hypersecretion, including carci-\nnoid syndrome (CS), due to serotonin and other compound\nsecretions, Cushing’s syndrome (CuS), due to adrenocorti-\ncotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion and acromegaly, due to\ngrowth\nhormone-releasing\nhormone\n(GHRH)\nsecre-\ntion.5,7,18,19 In a recent large population-based study series\nof 3002 LC patients, CS was present in 229 patients (7.6%)\nat diagnosis.20\nDiagnosis is carried out with bronchoscopic technique,\ntransthoracic biopsy or, less frequently, by mediastinoscopy\nor\nendobronchial\nendoscopic\nultrasonography\n(EBUS)\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).\nSurgery may be carried out upfront after adequate\nmedical\npreparation\nin\nlocalised\nresectable\ntumours\nresembling LCs or in tumours considered at high risk of\nbleeding or hormonal crisis or when previous biopsy has\nfailed. Once the diagnosis is suspected, standardised char-\nacterisation of LC comprises several speciﬁc steps for eval-\nuation that are described in Table 1 [III, B].4-9,18,20-34\nThC is revealed by tumour-related symptoms, or due to\nfunctionally active tumours or by chance.11-13 Diagnostic\nprocedures, including core biopsy under ultrasonography\nguidance, or preferably through a thoracic computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) scan, or upfront surgery following the guidelines for\nthymic tumour diagnosis, should be carried out.35 The authors\nrecommend standardised characterisation of ThC in multidis-\nciplinary expert centres as described in Table 1 [III, B].11,12,32-37\nThe histopathological diagnosis of LC or ThC relies on\ncharacteristic morphological features and on the demon-\nstration of the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour through\nthe immunodetection of a panel of markers including at least\nchromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin, which are usually\nexpressed in all carcinoids. This might be expanded to other\nmarkers such as CD56.1 Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1)\nmay be useful in well-differentiated tumours only, when\npositive, to suggest the lung origin of metastatic tumours.1\nTCs and ACs are distinguished (Supplementary Table S1,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003),\non the basis of mitotic count and presence or absence of\nnecrosis.1 While Ki-67 index is not included in the WHO\ncriteria, the WHO acknowledges that Ki-67 index might be\nuseful for the differential diagnosis between well- or poorly-\ndifferentiated NETs (Supplementary Table S1, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).1 Carcinoids\nare characterised by mutations involving either MEN-1 or\nother genes encoding chromatin-remodelling proteins.38,39\nTP53 and particularly RB1 gene alterations, which are rare\nmolecular events in carcinoids, might be potential tools to\ndiscriminate between well or poorly differentiated categories\nin difﬁcult cases like the recently identiﬁed LC with high\nproliferative features. This new subgroup is deﬁned by a\nmitotic count >10 and/or a Ki-67 index >20%, and a well-\ndifferentiated morphology (Supplementary Table S2, avail-\nable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).39-43\nThe ratio between TC and AC is about 6 : 10 in surgical se-\nries but may be closer to 1 : 1 in advanced cases.1,4,6,7,20\nThe ThC WHO classiﬁcation is identical to that of lung\nNETs with four categories including TC or AC deﬁned using\nthe same criteria (Supplementary Table S1, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003). The pattern\nof genetic alterations is different from LC.1,38 As for LCs, a\nsubgroup of ThC with high proliferative features has\nrecently been recognised.44 The ratio between atypical and\ntypical ThC is about 2 : 1.1,33,34,36\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Management of LC and ThC requires a multidisciplinary\nstandardised approach in specialised centres [IV, A]\n\u0001 Ki-67 (MIB 1) [IV, A], TTF1 [IV, B], p53/RB1 [IV, B]\nbiomarker analyses are recommended in selected cases\nfor differential diagnosis or site of origin orientation.\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nRisk assessments depend on pathology and TNM (tumoure\nnodeemetastasis) staging based on the combination of\nTable 1.

Insufﬁcient accuracy of CgA (30%-\n60% at the metastatic stage) makes research on new\nbiomarkers critical. Among these, a multianalyte molecular\nassay [51 transcripts; neuroendocrine tumor test (NETest)]\nis currently under development with potentially better\nsensitivity, but uncertainties remain regarding its positive\npredictive value and role as a prognostic marker for LC.22\nThe application of the 8th Edition of the Union for\nInternational\nCancer\nControl\n(UICC)\nTNM\nstaging\n(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) is recommended even\nif not speciﬁc to LCs.31,46,47 More than 80% of LCs are\ndiagnosed at TNM stage I or II.4,5-7,46 The most common\nsites of metastasis include liver, bone and lung. The diversity\nof metastatic sites and the potential overestimation of lung\nmetastasis and underestimation of brain metastasis must be\ntaken into account.46,47 The WHO classiﬁcation and patho-\nlogical TNM (pTNM) staging are intricate.5,21,48 In a recent\nstudy in which patients underwent \u000310 lymph node\nresection, frequency of positive lymph nodes was 17%\n(including 6% N2-N3) or 46% (including 23% N2-N3) in case\nof TC or AC, respectively.48\nMost ThCs are diagnosed at advanced-stage Masaokae\nKoga (Supplementary Table S5, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) or TNM stage III or\nIV.11,12,32 The most common sites for metastases include the\npleura, pericardium, bone, lung and liver.\nIn LCs, overall survival (OS) is mainly inﬂuenced by WHO\npathology and the pTNM classiﬁcations.1,5,21,45-49 In stage I,\nII, III or IV LC patients, 10-year disease-speciﬁc survival is\n96%, 85%, 81%, 59% and 88%, 75%, 47%, 18%, in TC or AC,\nrespectively, showing the major prognostic inﬂuence of the\nWHO classiﬁcation.46\nAfter resection, WHO classiﬁcation and pathological lymph\nnode staging (pN) status constitute the two main prognostic\nparameters (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).4,5,9,21,45,48-51\nAlthough\nKi-67 index is considered a promising prognostic marker by\nthe whole author panel, its technique of evaluation and the\nmost accurate thresholds remain a matter of debate; more-\nover, no deﬁnitive validation of its added value to WHO and\npTNM classiﬁcations has been provided so far in large series\nof LCs.18,28,45,52,53 At the metastatic stage, WHO classiﬁcation,\nperformance status, CgA levels, tumour burden and so-\nmatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) uptake, as well as tumour\ngrowth slope and the functioning syndrome, should be taken\ninto account for adequate risk assessment [IV, B].47 Prolonged\nsurvival of the majority of patients with LCs (including a 60%\n5-year OS for metastatic LC) makes adjusted toxicity proﬁle of\ntherapeutic interventions critical [V, A].47\nThe prognosis of patients with thymic NETs remains poor:\nin retrospective series, 5- or 10-year OS was 28%-72% or\n26%-60%, respectively.11-14,33 Based on a few large, retro-\nspective thymic NETs series, OS is inﬂuenced by stage,\nmainly\ntumour\nsize\nand\ncompleteness\nof\nresection\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).11-13,32,33,36 No speciﬁc staging\nsystem has yet been validated for ThC. The authors there-\nfore recommend the use of both staging systems (TNM,\nMasaokaeKoga) together with the WHO classiﬁcation and\nresection status for adequate prognostic stratiﬁcation.1\nRecommendations\n\u0001 WHO and pTNM classiﬁcations constitute the basis of\nthe prognostic classiﬁcation [II, B]\n\u0001 i.v. contrast-enhanced cross-sectional conventional imag-\ning including liver late arterial phase and PET-CT with\n68Ga-labelled SSAs constitute the basis of TNM evalua-\ntion [II, B]\n\u0001 Speciﬁc prognostic factors including tumour growth rate\nor presence of functioning syndromes are taken into ac-\ncount in advanced-stage LCs and ThCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Prolonged survival of most patients with LCs makes\nadjusted toxicity proﬁle of therapeutic interventions crit-\nical [V, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE,\nLOCAL RECURRENCE AND ADJUVANT THERAPY\nLocal/locoregional disease treatment\nControl of a functioning syndrome must be considered\nbefore any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]. Surgery\nrepresents the treatment of choice for LCs (both TCs and\nACs), even in the case of N2 lymph nodal metastases [IV,\nA].54 The surgical approach depends on tumour size, loca-\ntion and preoperative biopsy specimen assessment. The\nchoice of open surgery or minimally invasive approaches\nwill depend on the experience of the surgeon. Patients with\nsmall peripheral nodules may be candidates for minimally\ninvasive access including lung resection and lymph node\ndissection (usually a video-assisted lobectomy/segmentec-\ntomy). The surgical access for centrally located tumours,\nthose with suspected/proven metastatic lymph nodes,\nusually requires thoracotomy, depending on the surgeon’s\nexpertise.\nAnatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy,\nlobectomy,\nbilobectomy,\npneumonectomy)\nand\nlymph\nnode resection (with a minimum of six nodal stations:\nthree hilar and three mediastinaldalso including subcarinal\nstationdas recommended by the European Society of\nThoracic Surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer) is the\npreferred extent of resection [IV, B]. Indeed, wedge resec-\ntion may increase the risk of tumour recurrences, especially\nin N-positive TC or intermediate-grade ACs.4,5,55,56 In ACs,\nE. Baudin et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 32\n- Issue 4\n- 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003\n441\n\n---\nbut also in N-positive TCs, lobectomy is reported as superior\nto segmentectomy in terms of OS in some, but not\nall.5,7,8,18,51,54,55,57,58 Bronchoplastic procedures (e.g. sleeve\nresections) are preferred for suitable centrally located tu-\nmours, with the aim of avoiding pneumonectomy [IV B].\nTransfer of patients to specialist centres for sleeve resection\nshould be discussed [IV, B]. Frozen sections of bronchial and\nvascular margins are recommended to rule out tumour\ninvolvement of resection margins, a condition that conse-\nquently imposes a greater pulmonary resection. Systematic\nlymph node dissection is recommended as lymph node\nmetastases may be observed in up to 27% of TCs and in up\nto 47% of ACs, and lymph node resection inﬂuences the\nprognosis and the modality of follow-up5,45,48,49,56 [IV, B].\nR0 resection is achieved in >85% of cases.7,10\nIn case of distal lung parenchyma destruction, there is an\noption for endobronchial resection to relieve the obstruc-\ntion, followed by reassessment and deﬁnitive surgery a few\nweeks later.\nWatchful radiological follow-up, as an alternative to\nsurgery, may be considered in case of cT1N0 carcinoid\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH, but also in MEN-1 patients\nand patients with comorbid conditions, due to the indo-\nlent course of most tumours [IV, C]. Rarely, carcinoids\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH may progress and be\nconsidered\nfor\nsublobar\nresection\n(including\nwedge\nresection), especially in case of large tumour size and/or\npresence of lymph nodes and/or uncontrolled functioning\nsyndrome, as a potential alternative to anatomical surgery\nin these patients to preserve lung function; medical op-\ntions (SSAs) or nonsurgical locoregional therapeutic pro-\ncedures may also constitute potential alternatives to be\ndiscussed case by case [V, C].14,17,24 Patients with non-\nDIPNECH or non-MEN-1 multifocal LC primaries may\nconstitute a distinct entity which may beneﬁt from a\nsimilar management [V, C].59\nUpfront surgery can be offered for all ThCs deemed\nradically resectable [IV, B]. Resectability judgement is\nmostly based on the surgeon’s expertise in thymic surgery.\nProspective registration of these cases is recommended.\nMedian sternotomy is the standard surgical approach and\nless invasive forms of access (video-assisted, robotic-\nassisted) are currently being investigated; in selected\ncases (tumours invasive to the lung, great vessels or with\npleural/pericardial implants), a combined approach (ster-\nnotomy plus anterior thoracotomy) or a thoracotomy are\nrequired to achieve a complete tumour resection. Palliative\nsurgery is not recommended. Lymphadenectomy has his-\ntorically rarely been carried out at the time of resection of\nthymic tumours; however, the latest UICC TNM staging\nsystem recommends that locoregional lymph nodal dissec-\ntion should be carried out also during ThC resection.60 Due\nto the poor prognosis of ThC, prophylactic thymectomy\ncould be discussed in young male adult patients with MEN-\n1 at the time of initial or recurrent parathyroidectomy,\nespecially in families with aggressive thymic tumours [V,\nC];14,15,61\nthe\nbest\nsurgical\napproach\nmay\ninclude\ncervicotomy and upper sternal split or other surgical pro-\ncedures to avoid incomplete thymic resection.\nLocal recurrence therapy\nAfter a median follow-up of 54-121 months, recurrences\noccur in up to 7% of TCs and up to 35% of ACs.4,7,18,53,54\nOne-third are local recurrences.\nIn case of local recurrence, surgical resection with radical\nintent is recommended when technically feasible. In patients\nwith signiﬁcant comorbidity or high operative risk, palliative\nlocoregional procedures or watchful follow-up may constitute\nan alternative (Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).54,62\nAdjuvant therapy\nLarge retrospective studies have reported no beneﬁt of\nadjuvant therapy in both TCs and ACs.5,8-10,18 Therefore, the\nauthors do not recommend routine adjuvant therapy in LCs,\n[IV, D] for TC; [IV, C] for AC (Figure 1). However, it may be\nconsidered in selected ﬁt patients with particularly high risk\nof relapse (i.e. AC N2) after multidisciplinary discussion [IV,\nC]. We recommend prospective registration of these cases.\nMedical options, mainly cytotoxic chemotherapy (ChT) [plus\nor minus radiotherapy (RT)], cited in these guidelines,\nshould be considered ﬁrst.\nAvailable literature suggests no beneﬁt from adjuvant\ntherapy in ThCs [V, C].11-13,32 The majority of the author\npanel suggests individually discussing postoperative thera-\npies, including RT and/or systemic therapies (with options\ndiscussed in these guidelines), with patients with advanced-\nstage R0 or R1-2 resection [V, C] (Figure 2).\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Control of a functioning syndrome must be considered\nbefore any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]\n\u0001 An anatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy,\nlobectomy, bilobectomy) or bronchoplastic procedures\n(e.g. sleeve resections) together with lymph node dissec-\ntion are recommended in localised LCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Patients with cT1N0 LC within the setting of DIPNECH or\nMEN-1 syndromes, or with comorbid conditions, may\nbeneﬁt from an initial radiological follow-up without\ntreatment to determine the growth rate.

Palliative surgery\nor radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation or endo-\nbronchial treatment (EBT) of the primary tumour are oc-\ncasionally considered in cases of advanced disease at risk of\nlocal events or refractory CS [V, B]. More frequently, liver,\nbone and lung metastases represent potential targets for\nsuch strategies with the triple objectives of reducing the\nlocoregional risks, the primary tumour and the secretory\nburden (Figures 3 and 4). Such multiple locoregional man-\nagement may represent the only anti-tumour strategy in\npatients with slowly progressive tumours (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) [V, B].67,68,73-75\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Palliative surgery or locoregional procedures (RFA, cryoa-\nblation, EBT) of the primary tumour are occasionally\nconsidered in cases of advanced disease at risk of local\nevents or refractory CS [V, B]\n\u0001 Multiple locoregional therapies including surgery, com-\nbined or not with SSAs, are recommended to decrease\nthe tumour burden, to control hormonal secretions\nand to prevent local complications, as a ﬁrst-line thera-\npeutic approach in patients with advanced slowly pro-\ngressing LC [V, B].\nSystemic anti-tumour therapy\nSystemic anti-tumour therapies of patients with advanced\nLC are various, including SSAs, ChT, everolimus, peptide\nreceptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and interferon-a (IFN-\na) (Figure 4). These systemic therapies should be discussed\nwithin expert multidisciplinary teams for patients with\nmorphologically progressive tumours, high tumour burden\nor refractory functioning syndromes. No speciﬁc phase III\ntrial for LC exclusively has been published so far, therefore\nevidence comes mostly from retrospective analyses, less\nfrom phase II, single-arm trials, and sporadically from\nrandomised phase II or subgroups of phase III trials that\nenrolled a majority of GEP-NET patients. Everolimus is the\nonly treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA for LC.\nBased on the very limited data available in advanced ThC,\nwe recommend applying the same strategy as for LC.\nSSAs\nOctreotide [long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg] and lanreotide\n(120 mg) are the two SSAs most commonly used in clinical\npractice. Both showed antiproliferative activity and gains in\ntime to progression or progression-free survival (PFS) in\nplacebo-controlled, phase III trials enrolling good prognostic\nor\nslowly\nprogressive\nGEP-NETs,64\nwhere\nthey\nwere\napproved by the FDA and EMA for antiproliferative pur-\nposes. The placebo-controlled, randomised phase III trial,\nwhich evaluated lanreotide 120 mg in advanced LC, was\nstopped\nfor\ninsufﬁcient\nenrolment\n(SPINET\ntrial\nNCT02683941). Therefore, the feasibility of phase III trials in\nLC remains an issue. Two dedicated retrospective case series\nreported potential positive impact of SSAs, with a PFS of 17\nand 11 months, respectively.76,77 In the single, published,\nrandomised phase II LUNA trial, pasireotide 60 mg every 4\nweeks, in ﬁrst or second line after standard SSA therapy,\nachieved a 39% progression-free rate (PFR) at 9 months, in\na series of 41 LCs or ThCs with Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumours (RECIST) progression before enrolment\n(LUNA study). The PFR was not signiﬁcantly different from\nthat achieved with everolimus alone.20 On this basis, the\nauthors recommend SSA, for its better tolerability, as ﬁrst-\nline therapy in TC or slowly progressing somatostatin re-\nceptor (SSTR)-positive LC [IV, C].\nTargeted therapies\nEverolimus has been investigated in several clinical trials\nwhich included metastatic LCs and is currently the most\nstudied agent in LC. The RADIANT-4 study represents the\nlargest series of LCs ever included in a phase III trial\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10\n.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).78,79 Based on these results,\nthe FDA and EMA approved everolimus in advanced, pro-\ngressing, non-functional pulmonary and digestive NETs in\n2016. Furthermore, in the RADIANT-4 trial, everolimus\ndelayed\ntumour\nprogression\nwhile\npreserving\noverall\nhealth-related QoL.80 Everolimus has been reported to be\npotentially effective also in a post hoc analysis of the\nRADIANT-2 trial regarding a subgroup of LC associated with\na history of CS (Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).71,81\nEver-\nolimus is considered as ﬁrst-line therapy in the majority of\nACs or following progression to SSA for both TC and AC\npatients [II, B] (see Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003 for detailed\nLUNA trial data).\nE.

In few cases, with high proliferative ACs (Ki-67 >20%) or rapid growth, platinum-based ChT might be\nconsidered upfront (alternatives or second lines include everolimus or PRRT, based on SRI results).\ne PRRT should be considered as an alternative to ChT in selected patients (refractory carcinoid syndrome, SRI homogenous positive tumour uptake on all RECIST-\nevaluable targets). PRRT may be considered ﬁrst line in a few SRI-positive patients with refractory carcinoid syndrome and progressing or bulky tumours.\nf IFN-a should be considered as alternative to ChT especially if refractory carcinoid syndrome.

In few cases, with high proliferative ACs (Ki-67 >20%) or rapid growth, platinum-based ChT might be\nconsidered upfront (alternatives or second lines include everolimus or PRRT, based on SRI results).\ne PRRT should be considered as an alternative to ChT in selected patients (refractory carcinoid syndrome, SRI homogenous positive tumour uptake on all RECIST\nevaluable targets). PRRT may be considered ﬁrst line in a few SRI-positive patients with refractory carcinoid syndrome and progressing or bulky tumours.\nf IFN-a should be considered as alternative to ChT especially if refractory carcinoid syndrome.

It affects predominantly older,\nfair-skinned Caucasians and exhibits aggressive behaviour\nwith a high recurrence rate and a propensity for early\nmetastasis.1 Despite new advances in therapies for MCC,\nthe prognosis remains poor. With the incidence of MCC\nincreasing rapidly across Europe, prompt diagnosis and\neffective and harmonised management are imperative for\nimproving patient care.2\nThe European Parliament and the European Commission\nrecommend treating patients with rare cancers in centres\nlinked to the European Reference Network for Rare Adult\nSolid Cancers (EURACAN). In these referral centres with a\nhigh volume of MCC patients, the clinical experience of a\nmultidisciplinary team (MDT) specialising in skin cancers\nguarantees better treatment outcomes and access to\nclinical trials. Therefore, the objective of this guideline is to\nprovide a comprehensive reference for MCC, which is based\non a critical evaluation of current evidence and opinion of\nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) experts in\npartnership with EURACAN.\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nThe global incidence rates of MCC are difﬁcult to calculate\nbecause of its rarity, geographic and demographic vari-\nability and lack of large epidemiological studies.3 Since its\nﬁrst description in 1972, MCC incidence rates have\nsteadily increased, likely due to both the reﬁnements in\ndiagnostic capabilities and the progressively ageing pop-\nulation.4,5 The Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe\n(RARECARE) database reported the crude incidence esti-\nmate as 0.13 per 100 000 in 1995-2002.6 The incidence\nrate reported over time in the recent analysis of the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data-\nbase showed that in 1986, incidence and mortality rates\nper 100 000 were 0.22 and 0.03, respectively; these rates\nincreased to 0.79 and 0.43, respectively, in 2011.7 The\nhighest incidence rates of MCC are in Australia, where the\nage-adjusted incidence rate reported in Queensland was\n1.6 per 100 000.8\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: February 2024.\n2059-7029/© 2024 The Author(s).

In Australia, this\nis the opposite, with 80% UV- and 20% MCPyV-related.3\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nClinical diagnosis\nThe clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional lymph nodes (LNs),\ncomorbid conditions and patient life expectancy. MCC\nclassically presents as a pink or red-violaceous, painless,\nﬁrm, rapidly growing, dome-shaped or red plaque skin\nlesion, ranging in size from 1 to 2 cm. It typically occurs in\nolder patients in sun-exposed areas of their bodies. The\npredominant sites of MCC localisation include the head and\nneck (45%), upper limbs (24%), lower limbs (10%) and trunk\nor other sites (<10%), while in 11% of cases, there is no\nidentiﬁable primary lesion. Ulceration may occur in more\nadvanced MCC lesions. MCC enlarges rapidly, metastasises\nin transit to the skin and/or to ﬁrst-echelon LNs (26% of\ncases at initial presentation) and then to higher-order nodal\nregions and distant sites such as bones, liver and brain (8%\nof cases at initial presentation).12 MCC may be mis-\ndiagnosed as squamous- or basal-cell carcinoma, amela-\nnotic melanoma, adnexal tumour, primary cutaneous B-cell\nlymphoma or skin disorders such as pyogenic granuloma\nand\ninﬂammatory\ndisorders.13\nSince\nMCC\nhas\nbeen\nobserved contiguous to, or intermingled with, other skin\ncancers, the detection of polymorphous vessels and/or\nmilky-red areas by dermatoscopy enhances the differential\ndiagnostic accuracy, especially for patients with multiple\nskin lesions.14\nAetiology and molecular biology\nDespite major advances in understanding MCC carcino-\ngenesis, the cellular origin of MCC is still unclear. MCC has\nbeen hypothesised to originate from dermal ﬁbroblasts,\npre-/pro-B cells, Merkel-cell precursors potentially derived\nfrom epidermal stem cells and hair follicle stem cells.15 MCC\ncarcinogenesis can be initiated in the cell of origin either by\nUV-mediated DNA damage caused by chronic exposure to\nsunlight or by integration of the MCPyV into the host\ngenome.16,17 MCPyV is a ubiquitous virus usually acquired\nduring childhood, as indicated by frequent seropositivity of\nantibodies against the capsid protein VP1 in the blood.18\nHowever, primary infection with MCPyV does not cause\nany discernible signs or symptoms. Despite the high prev-\nalence of MCPyV infection, very few people develop MCC.\nAn essential feature of MCPyV-associated MCC is that the\ntumour cells express speciﬁc products of the viral early\ngenes, i.e. small T antigen (ST) and a truncated version of\nlarge T antigen (LT). LT and ST have also been referred to as\nviral oncoproteins, and their capacity to interact with mul-\ntiple cellular proteins, thereby altering their function, has\nbeen demonstrated.19,20 While MCPyV-associated MCCs are\ncharacterised by very low frequencies of somatic mutations,\nvirus-negative MCCs are among the tumours with the\nhighest mutational load, typically displaying UV signa-\ntures.21 Among the aberrations found in MCPyV-negative\nMCC,\nmutations\ndisrupting\nthe\ngene\nencoding\nthe\nretinoblastoma-associated protein RB1 (the key protein\ncontrolling cell cycle entry) are almost always present.\nAnalogously, RB1 function in virus-associated MCC is\ninhibited by binding the LXCXE motif of LT to RB1; in either\ncase, cells are unable to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell\ncycle.21 Interestingly, MCPyV is not found in cases of MCC\nassociated with cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, indi-\ncating that it does not play a part in these combined\ntumours.22,23\nHistopathology\nHistopathological features of MCC are those of a small-blue-\nround-cell tumour with a vesicular nucleus and scant\ncytoplasm.24 However, several different histopathological\npatterns exist, including trabecular, intermediate and small-\ncell variants. Neoplastic cells can also be large and may\npresent with a pleomorphic morphology. The nucleoli are\nmultiple and usually not prominent. Mitotic and apoptotic\nrates are frequently high. The tumour regularly inﬁltrates\nthe reticular dermis and subcutis. The epidermis, papillary\ndermis and adnexal structures are usually spared, although\nepidermotropism is observed in up to 10% of cases. The\npresence of intra-lymphatic emboli and isolated tumour\ncells close to the surgical margins may explain the high rate\nof local recurrences.24,25 As the histomorphology of MCC on\nhaematoxylineeosin (H&E) sections is rather nonspeciﬁc,\nthe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires immunohisto-\nchemical staining to rule out other tumours that display a\nsmall-blue-round-cell morphology (e.g. basal-cell carci-\nnoma; metastatic small-cell carcinoma, particularly from the\nlung; cutaneous lymphoma; anaplastic sweat gland carci-\nnoma; melanoma; Ewing’s sarcoma; neuroblastoma and\nrhabdomyosarcoma).24\nMCC cells express several types of cytoskeletal keratins\n(CKs), particularly CK20 (membranous and/or paranuclear\ndot-like), CK8, CK18 and CK19. A small subset of MCCs\n(<10%) are negative for CK20; these cases are characterised\nby a high mutational burden and are generally not associ-\nated with MCPyV. In addition to CKs, neoplastic cells also\nexpress chromogranin A, synaptophysin, cluster of differ-\nentiation\n(CD)56,\nneuron-speciﬁc\nenolase\n(NSE)\nand\nhuntingtin-interacting protein 1. MCC is usually negative for\nthyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), leukocyte common\nantigen, melan A, mammalian achaete-scute homologue 1,\nvimentin, protein S100 and CK7.23,24,26 However, rare cases\nESMO Open\nI. Lugowska et al.\n2\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\n\n---\nof MCC can be positive for TTF1 or CK7, and so interpre-\ntation of the staining patterns of these two antigens should\nbe carried out with caution. These markers should be\nincluded in an immunopanel for MCC conﬁrmation and\nexclusion of other diagnostic considerations.\nNo histological marker has been reliably associated with\nthe selective identiﬁcation of either virus- or UV-associated\nMCC: while positive staining for MCPyV LT strongly suggests\nan MCPyV-associated MCC, negative staining does not\nnecessarily rule it out.27,28 Although all of these markers are\nhelpful and essential for diagnosis, particularly in the\npresence of artefacts, no convincing evidence supports their\nuse to predict prognosis or response to therapy. Concerning\nthe latter, variable numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating cytotoxic\nT lymphocytes (not identiﬁed, brisk, non-brisk) are found in\nMCC tumours, and their presence is associated with a\nbetter prognosis, which is particularly favourable if their T-\ncell receptor repertoire is characterised by clonal diversity.29\nThe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires histopatholog-\nical examination of tissue obtained by incisional/excisional\nbiopsy.4 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other tissues such\nas fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical margins;\ntumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratumoural\nlymphocyte\ninﬁltration;\nimmunohistochemical\nproﬁle;\nMCPyV status and mitotic rate.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional LNs, comorbid\nconditions and patient life expectancy [III, A].\n\u0003 Histopathological MCC conﬁrmation should include H&E\nwith the dedicated immunopanel [III, A].\n\u0003 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other structures\nsuch as fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical mar-\ngins; tumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratu-\nmoural lymphocyte inﬁltration; immunohistochemical\nproﬁle; MCPyV status and mitotic rate [III, A].\n\u0003 Dermatoscopymayenhancedifferentialdiagnosticaccuracy,\nespecially for patients with multiple skin lesions [IV, B].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nThe preferred classiﬁcation is the eighth version of the\nUnion\nfor\nInternational\nCancer\nControl\n(UICC)\nTNM\n(tumourenodeemetastasis) staging and classiﬁcation sys-\ntem, which provides information for both management and\nprognosis of patients with MCC (see Supplementary\nTables\nS1-S4,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nesmoop.2024.102977).30 This classiﬁcation was developed\nbased on data collected from 9387 patients with MCC in the\nNational Cancer Database. Staging and risk assessment\nprocedures are determined based on disease presentation\nat diagnosis.31\nThe initial evaluation in MCC should include a complete\nexamination of the skin with particular attention to any\nsuspicious cancerous skin lesions, tumour satellites, in-\ntransit metastases, regional LNs and systemic metastases.\nThe assessment of disease extension in all patients is\nmandatory: ultrasound of regional LNs for patients with\nclinical stage I-II disease and computed tomography (CT) of\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis (and head/neck for head/\nneck primaries).32 Positron emission tomography (PET)eCT\nappears more sensitive than CT alone based on published\nmeta-analyses and other retrospective studies; it was\nshown that 16.8% of patients who underwent PETeCT had\ntheir disease upstaged compared with 6.9% of those who\nunderwent CT scans only.33,34 Therefore, if PET and/or PETe\nCT with [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) are available,\nthey are the preferred cross-sectional imaging methods to\nassess local and distant disease.16 If additional clinical\nsymptoms are present, detailed imaging studies using\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be carried out.\nSentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) with an appropriate immuno-\npanel is considered the most reliable staging procedure for\nidentifying subclinical nodal involvement. As such, it is\nrecommended for all patients with clinically node-negative\ndisease who are ﬁt for radical therapy. SLNB should be\ncarried out alongside local surgical therapy of the primary\ntumour with special attention to drainage patterns. The\nobserved 17.1% false-negative SLNB results may occur in\nimmunocompromised patients or tumours localised in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region.35,36 SLNB enables the\ndetection of micrometastases in approximately one-third of\npatients with clinically node-negative MCC, and its positivity\nrate is w20% for T1 and 40%-50% for T2 MCCs.37-39 In\nchallenging locations for SLNB, single-photon emission\ncomputed tomographyeCT techniques should be utilised.40\nAccess to a full pathological report with the number of\ninvolved LNs, the size of metastatic deposits and the status\nof the extracapsular extension is crucial for staging, pre-\ndiction and decision making.41 Patients with clinically\napparent nodal disease at presentation with an unknown\nprimary should have a biopsy for histological conﬁrmation\nof MCC.12,42\nThe 5-year overall survival (OS) in all MCC patients is be-\ntween 48% and 63%: 64% in patients without metastases\n(stage I-II), 51% in those with regional LN involvement (stage\nIII), 68% in those with an unknown primary tumour and 17%-\n29% in patients with distant metastases (stage IV).39,43-45\nRetrospective data have shown that unfavourable clinical\nprognostic factors are the presence of regional and distant\nmetastases, primary tumour diameter >2 cm and/or its\nextension beyond the dermis, location in the head/neck\nregion, >75 years of age, male sex and presence of co-\nmorbidity, especially immunosuppression (e.g. HIV, chronic\nlymphocytic leukaemia).3,39,43,46 The poor prognosis has\nalso been linked to histopathological futures such as posi-\ntive margins after resection, a high mitotic rate, inﬁltrative\n(rather than circumscribed) growth pattern, lymphovascular\ninﬁltration and p63 expression, whereas LT and RB1 protein\nexpression and intratumoural CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltra-\ntion correlate with a more favourable prognosis.10,12,24\nHowever, there are no prospective data available in MCC.\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n3\n\n---\nProgrammed\ndeath-ligand\n1\n(PD-L1)\nexpression\nis\nfrequently detected in MCC tumour cells and the tumour\nmicroenvironment. Nevertheless, its expression does not\ncorrelate with prognosis.47-49 Serum markers such as anti-\nbodies against MCPyV or NSE require further prospective\nvalidation.50,51\nRecommendations\n\u0003 SLNB is indicated to improve prognostic staging, e.g. to\nrule out occult nodal disease, but the precision of\nSLNB is less reliable in immunocompromised patients\nand in patients whose tumours are located in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region and with aberrant\nLN drainage [III, A].\n\u0003 Mandatory imaging studies comprise CT scans of the\nchest, abdomen, pelvis and head/neck (for head/neck\nprimaries). If available, whole-body FDGePET/CT is pref-\nerable over contrast-enhanced CT scan; MRI imaging of\nspeciﬁc organs should be carried out if clinically indi-\ncated [III, A].\n\u0003 The value of immunohistological markers, such as p63,\nPD-L1, NSE or CD200, is not fully established [IV, B].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nThe mainstay of treatment for patients with localised MCC\nis wide local excision (WLE) followed by tumour bed\nradiotherapy (RT) and management of the nodal basin. A\nproposed algorithm for the management of locoregional\nMCC is shown in Figure 1.\nSince wide excision can potentially compromise lymphatic\ndrainage, an SLNB should be carried out simultaneously with\nsurgical treatment of the primary MCC. A precise surgical\ntechnique called Mohs surgery may be considered instead of\nWLE in selected cases based on results from meta-analyses of\npatients with stage I MCC, which showed similar recurrence\nrates for both surgical modalities: local recurrence rates were\n6.8% for WLE versus 8.5% for Mohs surgery, and regional\nrecurrence rates were similar at w15%, although no rando-\nmised trials comparing traditional WLE with Mohs surgery\nwere included in these meta-analyses.52\nAfter resection, there is a need to obtain a clear patho-\nlogical margin, although the size of surgical margin is under\ndebate.53 In one publication, a margin >2 cm was associ-\nated with a signiﬁcant improvement in OS54; however, other\ndata have not supported a correlation between margin size\nbeyond 1 cm and additional clinical beneﬁt. In a study of\n6156 patients with localised MCC, resection margins >1 cm\nwere associated with improvements in OS compared with\nmargins of <1 cm; 5-year survival rates were 90% and 77%\n(P < 0.001), respectively.55\nAccording\nto\nﬁndings\nfrom\na\nretrospective\nstudy\ncomprising a cohort of patients who had clear margins\nfollowing resection and received post-operative RT, surgical\nexcision with margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus >1.0 cm was not\nassociated with any signiﬁcant difference in terms of OS,\nany recurrence-free survival (RFS) or local RFS.56 Thus,\nsurgical margins might be reduced to avoid reconstruction,\nespecially for preserving cosmetics (face) or function (lo-\ncations close to joints). Findings from this retrospective\nstudy also showed that excision, even with narrow margins\n(0.5-1.0 cm), was not associated with outcome. Cancer-\nspeciﬁc survival was 76.8% versus 76.2% for patients with\nresection margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus 1-2 cm, respectively.\nHowever, for patients with narrow resection margins, post-\noperative RT to the tumour bed is mandatory.56 In sum-\nmary, there is a need to obtain surgical margins of 1-2 cm\nand histologically negative margins, if feasible, which must\nbe followed by adjuvant RT regardless of the type of sur-\ngery.15,57-59\nThe beneﬁt of adjuvant RT following excision of the pri-\nmary tumour was shown in a systematic review and meta-\nanalysis considering >17 000 patients with stages I-III MCC\nfrom 29 observational studies.60 A favourable OS beneﬁt\nwas associated with surgery plus adjuvant RT versus surgery\nalone [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)\n0.75-0.86, P < 0.001]. The study also reported a signiﬁcant\nbeneﬁt in locoregional and local disease-free survival (DFS),\nbut not distant DFS (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.22-0.42; HR 0.21, 95%\nCI 0.14-0.33 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49-1.14, respectively).60\nThe largest series to date to assess whether adjuvant\ntherapy was associated with better survival included 6908\ncases from the National Cancer Database.61 It showed that\nfor localised MCC, surgery and adjuvant RT was associated\nwith a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in OS compared\nwith surgery alone (stage I: HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80; stage\nII: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89), but in patients with regional\nnodal metastases (stage III), neither the addition of adju-\nvant RT nor chemotherapy (ChT) had a signiﬁcant impact on\nOS. These ﬁndings suggest that the addition of RT may\nbeneﬁt the local control of localised disease; however, it is\nreasonable to believe that survival in patients with more\nadvanced disease may be driven by the presence of sub-\nclinical distant metastasis.61\nIt is worth noting that the MCC patient population con-\ntains elderly patients, which frequently causes clinicians to\ndeviate from standard treatment protocols. This was\nrecently\nillustrated\nin\na\nstudy\nthat\ninvestigated\nthe\nconcordance to adjuvant treatment guidelines in patients\nwith stage I-II MCC.62 Of the 2330 patients in this study,\n1858 had an indication for adjuvant RT [according to Na-\ntional Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines\ncriteria63] but only 57% of these patients received RT; those\nwho received RT had a 5-year OS advantage over those who\ndid not (76% versus 68%, P < 0.0003). Conversely, of the\n472 patients without an indication for adjuvant RT (ac-\ncording to NCCN criteria), 43% received RT; this group did\nnot show an OS beneﬁt over those who did not receive RT\n(79% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.48).62\nThe optimal adjuvant RT dose is unclear.64 In a retro-\nspective study of 2093 patients who underwent surgery\nfollowed by adjuvant RT, four groups of patients receiving\ndifferent doses of RT (30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy, 50-55 Gy and 55-\n70 Gy) were analysed; the 3-year OS rates were 41.8%,\n69.0%, 69.2% and 66.0%, respectively.65 An Australian study\nESMO Open\nI. Lugowska et al.\n4\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\n\n---\ndocumenting a dose response showed that no patients with\nmacroscopic MCC developed in-ﬁeld relapses at doses\n>56 Gy.66 Furthermore, in a large population-based study\nof patients with head and neck-located MCC (N ¼ 1625)\nundergoing adjuvant RT (85% with negative margins and\n15% with residual MCC), a dose range of 50-55 Gy conferred\na survival advantage compared with doses <50 Gy. There\nwas no signiﬁcant improvement by escalating doses beyond\nthis range, which could reﬂect toxicity-related morbidity or\ndeath from competing risks in this mostly older patient\ncohort.65 Therefore, a radiation dose of 50-60 Gy is often\nrecommended in MCC, achieving in-ﬁeld control.\nIn some patients, surgical therapy is not feasible due to\nthe extent of disease (technically inoperable) or the pres-\nence of signiﬁcant (co)morbidity. Since MCC is radiosensi-\ntive, RT as a single modality is an alternative to surgery in\nthis group. The natural history of patients treated with\ndeﬁnitive RT is out-of-ﬁeld relapse with in-ﬁeld control\nachieved in most patients.38 In a systematic review, an\nalmost 90% in-ﬁeld control rate was documented following\ndeﬁnitive RT with a mean dose delivered of just under\n50 Gy.38 Recurrences occurred at 39/332 sites (13 local\nrelapses, 26 regional) for a cumulative post-RT in-ﬁeld\nrecurrence rate of 11.7%. Of note, there was no association\nbetween RT dose and incidence of recurrence or non-\nrecurrence. RT of the primary tumour can also be curative\nwhen excision is not possible due to severe comorbidity\ndisqualifying the patient from surgery or in individuals who\nrefuse surgical treatment.67 However, there is also a lack\nof consensus regarding the optimal dose/fractionation\nschedule.

In a review of\n29 studies that included patients with stage I-II MCC, no\nsigniﬁcant difference in regional recurrence rate was\ndemonstrated with versus without adjuvant RT (14.3%\nversus 4.6%, P ¼ 0.31).38 Furthermore, similar regional\nnodal recurrence and OS rates were reported in a cohort\nof 240 patients who underwent SLNB or elective LN\ndissection\nwithout\nprior\npathological\nnodal\nstaging\n(P ¼ 0.056).69 However, in selected clinical situations,\nthere is value in adjuvant regional RT. It is recommended\nin patients with profound immunosuppression, if SLNB is\nnot carried out or its accuracy is questionable [i.e.\nanatomic compromise, aberrant LN drainage or the pres-\nence of multiple sentinel LN (SLN) basins which is typical\nin head, neck or midline trunk MCC].70\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III)\nPatients with stage III MCC have a competing risk of sys-\ntemic recurrence. On the other hand, in elderly patients,\nsevere comorbidity may lead to increased risk for intra-/\npost-operative complications and higher morbidity related\nto local therapy. Each decision on adjuvant therapy should\nideally be made within the conﬁnes of an MDT. In this sit-\nuation, there is a recommendation to include patients in\nclinical trials for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy when\navailable.\nIn the presence of microscopic metastasis detected on\nSLNB or during node dissection [pathological stage IIIA: T1-\n4, N1a, N1a(sn), M0], adjuvant RT alone or in combination\nwith complete LN dissection (CLND) may be considered and\nrequires an individualised approach. In a prospective study,\n163 patients with SLN metastasis only underwent CLND or\nRT, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in survival\noutcomes (5-year OS: 71% versus 64%, P ¼ 1.0; DFS: 52%\nversus 61%, P ¼ 0.8; nodal RFS: 76% versus 91%, P ¼ 0.3 or\ndistant relapse-free survival: 65% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.3,\nrespectively). With sufﬁcient in-ﬁeld control of macroscopic\nMCC, in selected fragile patients who cannot tolerate nodal\nexcision under local anaesthesia, RT as monotherapy should\nbe considered.71 Another retrospective study of 447 pa-\ntients with MCC and a positive SLNB collected in the Na-\ntional Cancer Database showed that adjuvant RT \u0004 CLND\nled to a survival beneﬁt compared with CLND alone or\nobservation.72 Therefore, in younger patients (<75 years of\nage) with fewer comorbidities, a multidisciplinary approach\nwith adjuvant RT and CLND may be beneﬁcial. However, the\npotential beneﬁt may be decreased by the potential com-\nplications of CLND, such as lymphoedema, post-operative\nwound infection, skin necrosis and wound dehiscence,\nwhich is higher in the inguinal basin than in axillary\ndissection (26% versus 9%, respectively).73\nNo randomised trials have evaluated the efﬁcacy of\nadjuvant ChT or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with\nMCC. Therefore, adjuvant ChT is not routinely indicated. The\ndata supporting CRT are derived from a retrospective study\nof 4815 patients with head and neck MCC.74 In male pa-\ntients with positive margins and a tumour size of >3 cm,\npost-operative CRT and RT both provided a survival beneﬁt\ncompared with surgery alone (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81;\nHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92, respectively).74 In a study of\n6908 patients in the National Cancer Database, there was\nno beneﬁt (or detriment) of giving adjuvant ChT to patients\nwith high-risk disease.61 In this fragile population, the risk of\nserious side-effects is signiﬁcantly higher due to existing\ncomorbidities, and ChT-related mortality is between 4% and\n8%. There is also a concern about the immunosuppressive\neffects of ChT, which may lead to the development and\nprogression of MCC.75-77\nA limited number of published case reports and series\nhave addressed MCC of unknown primary (pathological\nstage IIIA: T0, N1b, M0). This group has a better outcome\nthan patients with known primary and synchronous nodal\nmetastases.12,42 The recommendation in this group is to\ncarry out a biopsy for pathological conﬁrmation of MCC,\nFDGePETeCT to rule out distant metastatic disease and\nmanagement of the nodal lesions similar to that proposed\nfor stage IIIB MCC.\nFor patients with clinically positive nodal disease (path-\nological stage IIIB, T1-4, N1b-3, M0), cross-sectional imaging\nis advised before surgery. There have been no prospective\ntrials evaluating the appropriate extent of CLND clearance\nfor MCC; in the absence of such evidence, it is recom-\nmended to follow the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline\n(CPG) for cutaneous melanoma.78 An analysis of the SEER\ndatabase incorporated propensity scoring and matched-pair\nanalysis and reported no difference in MCC-speciﬁc survival\nin patients who received RT after CLND versus observa-\ntion.79,80 In another study, Lewis et al. carried out a data-\nbase analysis encompassing 1254 patients and found\nreductions in local and regional recurrences with similar\nrates of distant metastases, but no statistical difference in\nterms of OS and MCC-speciﬁc survival.81 Therefore, patients\nwith node-positive MCC should be considered for clinical\ntrials with (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy because neither\nadjuvant RT nor ChT has been associated with a statistically\nsigniﬁcant impact on OS.61\nSatellite or in-transit metastases (pathological stage IIIB,\nT1-4, N2-3, M0) at post-operative histology are caused by\nthe cutaneous or subcutaneous intra-lymphatic spread. The\nfrequency is unclear but it is always associated with poor\nsurvival.42,82,83 In bulky, multiple and/or frequently recur-\nrent locoregional metastases, isolated limb perfusion may\nESMO Open\nI.

In a phase I-II study (CheckMate 358) of\nnivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting, surgical resection\nwas conducted after two doses of nivolumab 240 mg given\n2 weeks apart.85 Among the 36 patients who underwent\nsurgery, 17 had a conﬁrmed pathological CR (pCR) and 18\nhad a partial response (PR) by radiological assessment. At a\nmedian follow-up of 20 months, no patient with a pCR\nexperienced disease relapse. Additional studies are required\nto conﬁrm the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and the\nextent of surgery or post-operative RT in patients with a\npCR.85 In the adjuvant setting, although initial reports failed\nto show a therapeutic beneﬁt with ipilimumab as adjuvant\nmonotherapy, interim results from a prospective rando-\nmised study suggest a beneﬁt in terms of DFS for the pro-\ngrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab.\nHowever, ﬁnal results from prospective randomised trials\nare required to determine the true beneﬁts of adjuvant PD-\n(L)1 blockade.86\nRecommendations\n\u0003 An MDT meeting comprising experts with signiﬁcant\nMCC experience should be convened to diagnose and\nmake decisions about therapy; the preferred option is\nparticipation in clinical trials [III, A].\nManagement of local/locoregional disease (stage I-III)\n\u0003 After excisional biopsy, WLE with a margin of 1-2 cm\nis considered adequate; if a resection margin of\n1-2 cm is not technically achievable, a narrower\nmargin (0.5-1.0 cm) with adjuvant RT may also be\nacceptable [IV, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant RT with 50-60 Gy to the tumour bed is recom-\nmended for tumours of \u00051 cm in diameter and/or with\nnegative prognostic features (stage \u0005IB) [IV, A].\n\u0003 In patients at very low risk of locoregional recurrence\n(stage IA), clinical observation may be an alternative\nbut such a decision should only be made at referral cen-\ntres [V, A].\n\u0003 When WLE is not feasible, deﬁnitive RT of the primary\ntumour is an alternative approach [V, B].\nManagement of early-stage MCC (stage I-II; T1-4 N0 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 SLNB should be carried out during local surgical therapy\nof the primary tumour with special attention to drainage\npatterns [III, A].\n\u0003 In patients with a negative SLNB, observation is an op-\ntion, but in case of a risk of false negativity of SLNB or\nwhen SLNB is not carried out, adjuvant RT to the primary\nsite and nodal basin may be considered. This decision\nmust only be made at referral centres [IV, B].\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III; T1-4 N1-3 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 After a positive SLNB, adjuvant RT alone or in combina-\ntion with CLND is recommended after an MDT discussion\n[IV, B].\n\u0003 In clinically positive LNs, multiple nodal involvements or\nextra-nodal extension of the SLN, regional LN dissection\nwith post-operative RT is recommended (or deﬁnitive RT\nin inoperable patients) [III, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant ChT is not recommended [IV, D]; patients should\nbe considered for clinical trials with (neo)adjuvant sys-\ntemic therapy of modern immunotherapies [III, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE\nDespite the recent advances in diagnosis and treatment,\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC remain incurable. Admin-\nistration of immunotherapy in the ﬁrst-/second-line settings\nis recommended (if there is no contraindication for immu-\nnotherapy).87,88 ChT, palliative RT, best supportive care or\nparticipation in clinical trials should be considered based on\nthe clinical situation. In patients with recurrent oligometa-\nstatic and resectable disease, surgical removal or stereo-\ntactic irradiation of metastases can be considered if\nsystemic immunotherapy is contraindicated or the disease\nis refractory. A proposed algorithm for the management of\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC is shown in Figure 2.\nImmunotherapy\nPD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors are effective in the treatment\nof metastatic MCC.89 These drugs allow the reactivation of T\nlymphocytes and the triggering of the adaptive immune\nsystem by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 of the\ntumour\nmicroenvironment\nand\nPD-1\nexpressed\non\nlymphocyte surfaces. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 restores the\nantitumour activity of effector T cells and the function of\nexhausted T cells.89\nDespite their proven efﬁcacy, resistance to immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can occur due to different\nmechanisms: intrinsic resistance in patients who do not\nrespond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or acquired resistance in\npatients\nwhose\ntumours\nprogress\nafter\nthe\ninitial\nresponse.90-92 Open questions regarding the immunogenic\ncharacteristics\nof\nboth\nMCPyV-positive\nand\n-negative\nMerkel-cell tumours and the lack of predictive biomarkers\nof response to treatment are still under evaluation. Clinical\nbeneﬁt was not associated with any other biomarker eval-\nuated to date, such as PD-L1, MCPyV status, tumour\nmutational burden or CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltration.90-92\nImmunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab [ESMO-\nMagnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale (ESMO-MCBS) v1.1\nscore: 4; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Euro-\npean Medicines Agency (EMA) approved], pembrolizumab\n[ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA approved, not EMA\napproved], retifanlimab (FDA and approved) and nivolu-\nmab (not EMA or FDA approved), have shown high\nresponse rates both as ﬁrst- and second-line treatments,\nI.

Therefore,\nimmunotherapy is recommended in this setting if no\ncontraindications exist.\nThe ideal duration of ICI therapy is currently unknown.\nOne retrospective analysis of data collected at a single\ninstitute showed that among 65 patients treated with\navelumab, 25 had an FDGePETeCT-conﬁrmed CR. The 12-\nmonth RFS rate in these patients was 88% (95% CI 0.74-\n1.0). Reasons for stopping treatment included completion\nof 1 year of treatment (13 patients), toxicity (5 patients) and\npatient preference (7 patients).93 Prospective data from\nlarger patient cohorts and with longer follow-up are\ntherefore required to conﬁrm the ideal duration of ICI\ntherapy in patients with MCC.\nAvelumab. The efﬁcacy and safety of avelumab, an anti-PD-\nL1 inhibitor, were analysed in the JAVELIN Merkel 200 study,\nwhich was divided into parts A and B.94,95 Part A included\n88 patients with metastatic MCC who progressed after at\nleast one line of ChT. After >2 years of follow-up, the\nobjective response rate (ORR) was 33.0% (11.4% CR), me-\ndian duration of response (DoR) was 40.5 months and the\nDoR was >2 years in 67.0% of responders.90,94,95 In part B,\npatients who had not received prior systemic treatment for\nmetastatic disease were enrolled; the ORR was 39.7%\n(16.4% CR) with 30.2% having a response lasting >6\nmonths; the median OS was 20.3 months. First-line avelu-\nmab treatment was generally well-tolerated, and no\ntreatment-related deaths or grade 4 adverse events (AEs)\noccurred.\nIn\nthe\npretreated\npopulation,\ngrade\n3-4\ntreatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were observed in 11.4% of\npatients. From December 2015 to March 2019, 494 patients\nreceived avelumab as a ﬁrst- or second-line treatment for\nMCC within an expanded access programme (EAP); the ORR\nwas 46.7% (22.9% CR) and the disease control rate was\n71.2%. Avelumab was also associated with long-lasting\ndisease\ncontrol\nand\na\npositive\neffect\non\nOS.90,94,95\nEmerging real-world data suggest that outcomes with ave-\nlumab in clinical practice are in line with those seen in\nclinical trials.96 Recently published global data from EAPs\nand retrospective studies reported ORRs ranging from\n29.1% to 72.1% [CR 15.8%-37.2%; PR 18.2%-42.1% and\nstable disease (SD) 7.1%-30.9%], with median progression-\nfree survival (PFS) ranging from 8.1 to 24.1 months.\nImportantly, immunosuppressed patients also beneﬁted\nfrom avelumab, with response rates equivalent to the\ngeneral population. The best outcomes were achieved when\navelumab was given as ﬁrst-line therapy. The most common\nAEs were fatigue and infusion-related reactions; autoim-\nmune hepatitis and thyroiditis were also observed.97\nPembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab, a humanised immuno-\nglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that selectively\nbinds PD-1 on the surface of T lymphocytes, has been\ntested as a ﬁrst-line treatment in patients with MCC.98,99 In\na phase II clinical trial (KEYNOTE-017), 50 patients received\npembrolizumab for up to 2 years. TRAEs of any grade\noccurred in 49 of 50 patients (98%) and 15 patients (30%)\nhad grade \u00053 TRAEs with one death due to pericardial and\npleural effusion. The ORR was 58%, with 30% of patients\nachieving a CR. At 3 years, the PFS was 39.1% with a median\nPFS of 16.8 months; the 3-year OS rate was 59.4%, with a\nmedian OS not reached.99 Age, gender, baseline tumour\nburden, anatomic sites of metastasis and tumour PD-L1\nexpression and viral status expression did not correlate\nwith ORR, PFS or OS.98,99\nNivolumab. Nivolumab, a fully human anti-PD-1 IgG4\nmonoclonal antibody, was evaluated in two prospective\nstudies in combination with ipilimumab. A randomised,\nopen-label, phase II trial showed that in 50 patients\n[including 26 who had received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy],\nnivolumabeipilimumab [with half of the patients also\nreceiving stereotactic body RT (SBRT) (24 Gy in three frac-\ntions)] was associated with a high response rate and an\nManagement of inoperable/metastatic MCC (stage III-IV)\nAssessment of PS and comorbidities\nFirst line: \nPreferred: clinical trial [III, B]\nAlternative: immunotherapy (avelumaba [III, A; MCBS 4]b, \npembrolizumabc [III, A; MCBS 3]b, retifanlimaba [III, A] or \nnivolumabd [III, A]) + BSC\nSecond line: \nPreferred: clinical trial [III, B] \nAlternative: palliative RT and/or ChT + BSC [III, B]\nThird line: \nPreferred: clinical trial [III, B]\nAlternative: BSC\nFigure 2.

Although the effectiveness of\nnivolumabeipilimumab looks promising, data are immature\nand limited to a small sample size. It is also important to\nconsider the signiﬁcant risk of severe AEs in the elderly MCC\npopulation. Findings from the phase I/II CheckMate 358\ntrial also suggest that nivolumab is active as monotherapy\nin patients with advanced MCC. Among 25 treated patients\n(22 assessable), the ORR was 68% and the 3-month PFS and\nOS rates were 82% and 92%, respectively.77\nRetifanlimab. Retifanlimab is a humanised, hinge-stabilised\nIgG4k, anti-PD-1 antibody that is EMA and FDA approved\nfor the treatment of metastatic or recurrent locally\nadvanced MCC not amenable to curative surgery or RT\nbased on data from the phase II POD1UM-201 trial. In this\ntrial, retifanlimab treatment resulted in an ORR of 52% (95%\nCI 40% to 65%) in ChT-naive patients (N ¼ 65; CR 18% and\nPR 34%) with a median DoR between 1.1 months and >24.9\nmonths. Twenty-two\npercent\nof\npatients\nexperienced\nserious TRAEs, including fatigue, arrhythmia and pneumo-\nnitis, and 11% discontinued therapy due to AEs (the most\ncommon AEs were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus,\ndiarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and nausea).101\nChT\nAs there are no randomised trials in patients with MCC and\ndistant metastases, the impact of systemic ChT on survival is\nunclear. To date, available data are insufﬁcient to determine\nwhich of the different ChT regimens ensures the best PFS\nand OS in patients with metastatic MCC.\nChT regimens that have been used to treat patients with\nMCC include taxanes, topotecan, a combination of etopo-\nsideecisplatin, etoposideecarboplatin or cyclophosphamidee\ndoxorubicinevincristine.102 Response rates ranged from 20%\nto 75%, with higher response rates in the ﬁrst-line setting\n(53%-61%) versus the second-line setting (23%-45%); among\nresponders, the median DoRs were w2-9 months.76,103,104\nUnfortunately, in this fragile, elderly population, the occur-\nrence of toxic deaths limits ChT usage; toxic deaths were\nobserved in 3%-10% of patients.76,103,104 However, ChT might\nbe proposed after failure on immunotherapy or when\nimmunotherapy is contraindicated.\nTargeted therapies\nIn the UKMCC-01 trial, the efﬁcacy of pazopanib was\nassessed in 16 patients with MCC and a median age of 73\nyears (range 56-90 years).105 A clinical beneﬁt was reported\nin nine patients (three had a PR and six had SD) with a\nmedian duration of 8.0 weeks (range 1.3-38.4 weeks). The\ntrial was stopped due to slow accrual.105 A lack of activity\nand limited tolerance were also shown in a phase II trial\nwith cabozantinib in patients with recurrent/metastatic\nMCC after platinum failure.106 Based on published results,\nthe use of targeted therapy is not recommended.\nWith regard to radioligand therapy, although MCC\nfrequently\nexpresses\nsomatostatin\nreceptors,\nGa68-\nDOTATOC and Lu177-DOTATATE have only been studied\nin a few patients and further clinical trials are needed to\ndetermine their role in MCC.102,107 As such, they should not\ncurrently be considered as a standard of care.\nPalliative RT\nPalliative RT has mainly been assessed retrospectively. In a\nstudy applying an 8-Gy single fraction, a CR with almost 80%\nof in-ﬁeld lesion control was documented in 45% of pa-\ntients.87 Another study comparing 8 Gy as a single or\nmultiple fractions (3 \u0006 8 Gy) documented a CR in 10%\nversus 48% and a recurrence rate of 41% versus 5% (P ¼\n0.04), respectively.108 Patients of poor performance status\nshould be considered for a lower dose hypofractionation\nschedule (e.g. 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions),\nwhich can still achieve tumour regression.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Patients should receive individualised multimodality\ntreatment in referral centres for rare skin cancers with\naccess to clinical trials [III, B].\n\u0003 In oligometastatic disease progression, surgical removal\nor stereotactic irradiation of operable locoregional recur-\nrence or a single distant metastasis should be considered\nin ﬁt patients, although systemic immunotherapy should\nbe considered as the ﬁrst step [V, B].\n\u0003 Immunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab (III, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4; FDA and EMA approved),\npembrolizumab (III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA\napproved, not EMA approved), retifanlimab (III, A; FDA\nand EMA approved) and nivolumab (III, A; not EMA or\nFDA approved), are recommended as ﬁrst- and second-\nline treatments if no contraindications exist.\n\u0003 In cases of inoperable/disseminated disease, ﬁrst-line\ntreatment with an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody is suggested\nas it is more effective and safer than ChT [II, B].\n\u0003 In patients with contraindications or after failure of\nimmunotherapy, palliative RT and/or ChT may be op-\ntions, but their impact on OS is uncertain [III, B].\nPOPULATIONS OF SPECIAL CONSIDERATION\nSince MCC is present mainly in elderly patients, use of\ngeriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity assessments\nare important for decision making to achieve disease con-\ntrol and assure an acceptable quality of life. For patients\nwho are not medical candidates for surgery, RT alone may\nbe considered. However, in patients with inoperable/met-\nastatic disease, given the relatively good tolerability of ICIs,\nthese agents are the preferred choice of systemic therapy\nfor this subset of patients.\nI.

No formal\nclinical\ntrials\nhave\nevaluated\nthe\noptimal\nsurveillance\nschedule in MCC, either in terms of frequency or type of\ndiagnostic examinations. As the risk of relapse is higher in the\nﬁrst 2-3 years after initial treatment (40%-50% nodal and 33%\ndistant metastases),15 more intense follow-up should be\napplied in this period. Follow-up examinations are recom-\nmended every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, and then\nevery 6 months until year 5. After 5 years of observation, a\ngeneral physical examination is recommended every 12\nmonths lifelong, including a complete skin check-up. Physical\nexamination should include total-body skin examination and\nLN assessment with particular attention to the scar region,\nincluding the primary site, in-transit region and regional LN\nbasin. Distant metastases may develop in a wide range of\nanatomical locations; thus, routine cross-sectional imaging\nmay be proposed in higher-risk patients.\nThe radiological examination may be either a diagnostic CT\nof the thorax/abdomen/pelvis (and head/neck for patients\nwith head and neck primaries) or whole-body PETeCT, un-\ndertaken every 6-12 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, with ul-\ntrasound scans used for local LN assessment. After year 3,\nimaging studies should be carried out as clinically indicated.\nPatients with MCC have a higher risk for developing another\nskin cancer9,15,39,111,112; therefore, education regarding self-\nexamination of the whole skin surface is valuable. The role\nof MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncertain but it\nmay be utilised in patients who are seropositive at base-\nline.50,113,114 The early detection of a locoregional relapse\nmay be cured by surgery. However, inoperable/metastatic\nrelapse should be treated as metastatic disease, as described\nin the previous section.115-117 Therapy should be coordinated\nby an MDT at the referral centre.87,118,119\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Follow-up examinations are recommended in radically\ntreated patients every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years,\nand then every 6 months up to year 5. After 5 years of\nobservation,\na\ngeneral\nphysical\nexamination\nis\nrecommended every 12 months lifelong, including a\ncomplete skin check-up [IV, A].\n\u0003 Patient education regarding self-examination of the\nwhole skin is valuable as patients with MCC have a\nhigher risk of developing another skin cancer [IV, A].\n\u0003 The role of MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncer-\ntain, but it may be utilised in patients who are seropos-\nitive at baseline [V, A].\n\u0003 Routine cross-sectional imaging may be proposed in\nhigher-risk patients [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG has been developed by ESMO in partnership with\nEURACAN, in accordance with the ESMO standard operating\nprocedures for CPG development (http://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-GuidelinesMethodology).\nThe\nrelevant\nliterature has been selected by the expert authors. The\nguideline is conceived to provide a standard approach to\ndiagnosis, treatment and survivorship of MCC. Due to the\nrarity of MCC incidence, prospective and randomised\nstudies are limited; therefore, the basis of this guideline was\nmainly\ndata\nfrom\nretrospective,\nobservational\ncohort\nstudies, both institutional and cancer registry-based, often\nwith heterogeneous results. These studies have many limi-\ntations, such as selection bias, confounding factors, limited\nand missing data and lack of randomisation. Recommended\ninterventions are intended to correspond to the ‘standard’\napproaches according to current consensus among the Eu-\nropean multidisciplinary MCC community of experts. These\nare represented by the members of the ESMO Melanoma\nFaculty and experts appointed by all institutions belonging\nto the Rare Skin Cancer domain of EURACAN. Experimental\ninterventions considered to be beneﬁcial are labelled as\n‘investigational’. Other non-standard approaches may be\nproposed to the single patient as ‘options’ for a shared\npatientephysician decision in conditions of uncertainty as\nlong as some supporting evidence (though not conclusive) is\navailable. Algorithms accompany the text, covering the\nmain typical presentations of disease, and are meant to\nguide the user throughout the text. An ESMO-MCBS table\nwith ESMO-MCBS scores is included in Supplementary\nTable S5, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.102977. ESMO-MCBS v1.1120 was used to calculate\nscores for new therapies/indications approved by the EMA\nand/or the FDA (https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-\nMCBS). The scores have been calculated and validated by\nthe ESMO-MCBS Working Group and reviewed by the au-\nthors. The FDA/EMA or other regulatory body approval\nstatus of new therapies/indications is reported at the time\nof writing this CPG. Levels of evidence and grades of\nrecommendation have been applied using the system\nshown in Supplementary Table S6, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977.121\nStatements\nwithout grading were considered justiﬁed standard clinical\npractice by the authors.

The objective of the initial diagnostic\nwork-up of UKP-NENs is to identify the occult primary\ntumour. Metastatic patterns can be indicative of primary\ntumour location. The most common site for the occult pri-\nmary is the ileum followed by the pancreas.16 Ileal NETs\noften present as a mesenteric mass on computed tomog-\nraphy (CT).16 Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging (SRI)\nwith\ngallium-68-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-\ntetraacetic acid-labelled somatostatin analogue ([68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSA)epositron emission tomography (PET)eCT is the\nmost sensitive technique for NETs, detecting an occult pri-\nmary in 61% of cases.17 If SRI is uninformative, [18F]\nF-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)ePETeCT and endoscopy\ntechniques can be useful (see Supplementary Table S1,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664, and Section 3 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664).\nFor\nNECs,\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose\n(FDG)ePETeCT may be used. The presence of secretory\nsyndromes and elevated hormone levels may also facilitate\nidentiﬁcation of the primary NET. A minimum panel of\npeptide\nhormones\nshould\nbe\nmeasured\nin\npatients\nwith\nUKP-NETs\n[calcitonin,\nmetanephrines\nand\n5-\nhydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)]. Other hormones may\nbe measured depending on symptoms (see Supplementary\nTable S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664,\nand\nSection\n3\nof\nthe\nSupplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664). Chromogranin A has demonstrated a sensi-\ntivity of 71% and speciﬁcity of 84%-85% for the detection of\ngastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs.18\nIt is important to distinguish between primary GUGy-\nNETs and metastasis in the GUGy system from primary tu-\nmours in another site. Indeed, ovarian, testicular and renal\nmetastases occur in patients with GEP or lung NETs.\nSymptoms result from local inﬁltration in patients with\nmore aggressive GUGy-NENs and performance status (PS)\ndeterioration. Less than 15% of GUGy-NETs present with\nhormone-related symptoms (mostly carcinoid syndrome).1\nHN-NENs induce non-speciﬁc symptoms such as hoarse-\nness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, nasal obstruction, epistaxis and\nconductive hearing loss.19,20 Laryngeal NENs arise from the\nsupraglottic region in 85% of cases.8 Middle-ear NENs appear\nas a retrotympanic mass extending into the ossicles, mastoid,\nauditory canal and Eustachian tube.9,19 Sinonasal NENs occur\nin the ethmoid (64% of cases), nasal cavity (32%) and maxil-\nlary sinus (14%). The most common metastatic sites are the\nlymph nodes, lungs, liver and bones.21 Skin metastases can be\nextremely painful and suggestive of laryngeal NETs.22 Func-\ntional syndromes are rare and include carcinoid syndrome,\nsyndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hor-\nmone, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome and\nLamberteEaton myasthenic syndrome.23\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients\nwith UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs should be discussed in a\nNEN multidisciplinary tumour board (MTB) [V, A].\n\u0003 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs should be classiﬁed and\ngraded according to the common IARCeWHO 2018\nconsensus classiﬁcation together with the organ-speciﬁc\nWHO classiﬁcation [V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, IHC should be carried out to exclude para-\ngangliomas (cytokeratin) and to identify the primary [as a\nminimum: thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and\ncaudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX-2)]. Calcitonin, serotonin\nand other IHC markers may be used [IV, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, secretory syn-\ndromes should be diagnosed based on hormone-related\nsymptoms. As a minimum, metanephrines, 5-HIAA and\ncalcitonin should be measured in those with UKP-NETs\n[V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, cross-sectional imaging may identify meta-\nstatic patterns suggestive of a primary site (e.g. a mesen-\nteric mass indicative of an ileal NET) [IV, A].

FDGePETeCT may be helpful\nin NENs with a higher proliferation index (G3 NETs\nand NECs) [V, B]. [18F]F-DOPAePETeCT may also detect\nan ileum primary, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma\nin patients with UKP-NETs [V, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-NECs, searches for the primary\nshould not delay treatment intervention, apart from cuta-\nneous examination for Merkel-cell carcinoma and IHC for\ncytokeratin 20 and Merkel-cell polyomavirus, if available\n[V, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nAdequate staging of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs relies on\ncross-sectional imaging and nuclear medicine techniques.\nCT scans are effective for the detection of lung metastases\nwhereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is better for\nliver and bone metastases. MRI is also preferred in young\npatients as radiation exposure is lower. SRI has a high\nsensitivity for NETs and should be part of the initial work-\nup. SSTR scintigraphy is less sensitive and should only be\ncarried out when SRIePETeCT is not available. Whole body\nCT, or FDGePETeCT in case of limited tumour burden, are\nrecommended for the staging of G2-3 NETs and NECs.24\nStaging of middle-ear HN-NENs is based on the system\nproposed by Marinelli et al.19 while staging of GUGy- and\nHN-NENs is based on the eighth edition of the Union for\nInternational Cancer Control (UICC) TNM (tumourenodee\nmetastasis) classiﬁcation25 (see Supplementary Tables S2-\nS10, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). There is no staging classiﬁcation for UKP-NENs\nunless an occult primary is identiﬁed by the initial diag-\nnostic work-up.\nPrognosis for all NENs relies on pathological grading and\nstaging. In patients with metastases, differentiation, WHO\ngrade, age, PS, tumour burden, SRI and/or FDG uptake, the\npresence of a functional syndrome at baseline and tumour\ngrowth rate should be considered for optimal risk assessment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 CT and/or MRI are recommended for staging. MRI should\nbe mainly considered in young patients to reduce irradi-\nation anddusing late arterial phase imagingdimprove\ndetection of hepatic, pancreatic, brain and bone NETs\n[III, A].\n\u0003 SRIePET is recommended for initial and preoperative\nstaging, and when indicated for restaging [V, A].\n\u0003 FDGePETeCT can be used for staging G2-3 NETs and\nNECs [IV, B].\n\u0003 Major independent prognostic factors are disease stage\n(TNM) and pathological features including differentiation\nand WHO grade [IV, A]. Age, PS, tumour burden, the pres-\nence of functional syndromes and tumour growth rate\nare additional prognostic factors [IV, B].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nPatients with UKP-NENs may present with lymph node\nmetastases without the detection of a primary tumour or\ndistant metastases. For G1-3 UKP-NETs, radical resection of\nlocoregional\ndisease\nis the\npreferred\ntreatment\n(see\nFigure 1). While searching for an occult primary, the site of\nlymph node metastasis may guide surgical exploration (e.g.\nan involved mesenteric node is suggestive of an ileal pri-\nmary). There is no evidence to support adjuvant therapy\nfollowing curative resection of NETs. For UKP-NECs, down-\nstaging of locoregional disease with chemotherapy (ChT)\nand/or radiotherapy (RT) may be considered before surgery.\nSome patients with NECs, particularly with isolated inguinal\nor neck nodes, may have prolonged disease control and\nsurvival following multimodal treatment including sur-\ngery.26 In this setting, Merkel-cell carcinoma should be ruled\nout. It is unclear whether post-operative treatment of NECs\nimproves\noutcomes,\nbut\nfour cycles of carboplatine\netoposide may be considered, particularly if neoadjuvant\nChT has not been used.27\nThere are no prospective data on the management of\nlocal and locoregional disease in patients with GUGy-NENs.\nRecommendations are therefore extrapolated from site-\nspeciﬁc ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs).28 For\nGUGy-NETs,\nupfront\nradical\nsurgery\nwithout\nadjuvant\ntreatment is recommended when feasible (see Figure 2);\nhowever, a conservative surgical approach should be dis-\ncussed whenever possible, particularly for low-grade local-\nised NETs. The role of adjuvant therapy for G3 GUGy-NETs is\nalso unknown. For GUGy-NECs, multimodal therapy should\nalways be discussed for localised disease. Further details\nregarding the management of local and locoregional GUGy-\nNENs are available in Section 4 of the Supplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664.\nFor HN-NENs, locoregional treatment depends on the\nprimary site (see Figure 3). In the larynx, NETs are mainly\nsupraglottic and their sensitivity to ChT and RT may be low.\nBased\non\nretrospective\ndata,\nradical\nresection\nafter\ncompletion of whole body imaging (including PETeCT) is\nrecommended whenever possible with homolateral neck\ndissection, as it may lower the risk of regional lymph node\nrecurrence.8 Post-operative RT should be discussed in a\nmultidisciplinary meeting, particularly for G2 NETs.8 For\nlaryngeal NECs, treatment relies mainly on ChT and RT8;\nsurgery may be discussed in selected cases.29 For sinonasal\nNETs, surgery was associated with longer survival in retro-\nspective series.30,31 The role of prophylactic neck dissection\nis unknown. Post-operative RT should be discussed but\nthere is no evidence that it prevents locoregional relapse.\nFor sinonasal NECs, treatment should be multimodal.\nRetrospective data suggest that induction ChT is beneﬁ-\ncial,10 in combination with RT in most cases and surgery in\nselected cases.21,31 Most middle-ear tumours are NETs.\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment,19,32 but complete\nresection with no tumour at the margin (R0) is challenging\nand there is a risk of locoregional relapse when ossicles are\nJ.

There are no data on post-operative RT; however,\nRT may be discussed for patients with a higher risk of\nrelapse due to adherence to important neurovascular\nstructures. RT might prevent extension to the skull base and\nsubsequent\ndebilitating\ncomplications.\nThis\nmust\nbe\nbalanced against the risk of long-term RT-induced toxicity.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-NETs with locoregional disease, the\naim of surgical resection with exploration is to identify\nand treat the primary tumour with microscopic radical\nintent [V, A].\n\u0003 For GUGy-NETs, surgery of the primary tumour and nodes\nwith microscopic radical intent (according to site-speciﬁc\nESMO CPGs) is the treatment of choice for local and\nlocoregional disease, irrespective of grade [V, A]. A con-\nservative surgical approach should be discussed when-\never feasible, particularly in low-grade, early-stage NETs\n[V, B].\n\u0003 For laryngeal and sinonasal NETs, surgery of the primary\ntumour with microscopic radical intent and homolateral\ntherapeutic neck dissection is recommended whenever\npossible [IV, A].\n\u0003 Adjuvant treatment cannot be recommended for UKP-\nNETs [V, D] but adjuvant RT may be discussed for GUGy-\nNETs in patients with microscopic (R1) or macroscopic\n(R2) tumour at the margin and/or G3 disease [V, C].\n\u0003 For HN-NETs, adjuvant RT may be discussed after radical\nresection, particularly in case of locoregional spread,\nnon-R0 resection and G2 disease; however, the beneﬁt\nin terms of local control is unknown [V, C].\n\u0003 For locoregional sinonasal NECs, neoadjuvant ChT with\nplatinumeetoposide may be considered before surgical\nresection [IV, C].\n\u0003 For NECs treated with radical surgery, adjuvant therapy\nwith four cycles of platinumeetoposide may be consid-\nered [V, B].\n\u0003 Neoadjuvant ChT may be an option for UKP- and GUGy-\nNECs [V, C].\n\u0003 Combining RT with ChT is recommended for HN-NECs [IV,\nA] and could be discussed for UKP- and GUGy-NECs as\ndeﬁnitive or (neo)adjuvant treatment [V, C].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nFor UKP-NETs there are few clinical trials with low patient\nnumbers and for UKP-NECs there are only retrospective\nFigure 1.

Thus, recommendations for the man-\nagement of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs are based on the\nmanagement of NENs of GEP or lung origin and so systemic\ntreatments approved for GEP-NETs are used off-label in this\nsetting.28 When an occult primary is identiﬁed or suspected\n(such as a mesenteric mass from an ileal NET), its man-\nagement should follow the dedicated guideline.\nTreatment decisions (see Figure 4) should be based on\ncomprehensive multidisciplinary characterisation of the\ntumour (see ‘Staging and risk assessment’). In particular,\nWHO grade, differentiation (well versus poor),33 SSTR status\nbased on SRIePETeCT24 and presence of a functional syn-\ndrome should be considered.\nSurgery and locoregional therapies. Surgery should be\ndiscussed\nfor\nslowly\nproliferating\n(oligo)metastatic\ntumours in patients with G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs;\nthis includes surgical exploration for occult primary\nidentiﬁcation in case of UKP-NETs.34 Metastatic spread in\nHN-NETs frequently involves the skin, particularly in those\narising from the larynx.20,22 Skin metastases are usually\nmultiple and small in size, causing hard-to-treat pain and\ndiscomfort, which affects patients’ quality of life. In most\ncases, they are resistant to systemic treatment. Repeated\nlocoregional therapies may be used, including surgical\nresection, electrochemotherapy35 and RT for the largest\ntumours.22\nSomatostatin analogues. Two phase III trials [CLARINET\n(lanreotide) and PROMID (octreotide)] have reported longer\nprogression-free survival (PFS) or time to progression with\nsomatostatin analogue (SSA) treatment compared with\nplacebo in patients with metastatic GEP-NETs.

Based on data from the RADIANT-2,42\nRADIANT-343 and RADIANT-444 trials (NETs of various pri-\nmaries), everolimus monotherapy may be considered as\nﬁrst-line treatment for SSTR-negative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and\nHN-NETs, or as second-line treatment after SSAs in patients\nwith progressive disease. The RADIANT studies, however,\nincluded only 36 patients with UKP-NETs and no patients\nwith GUGy- or HN-NETs. Based on the randomised CABI-\nNET,45 AXINET46 and SANET-ep47 trials, antiangiogenic\nmultikinase inhibitors (MKIs) may be considered as alter-\nnatives to everolimus for ﬁrst-line treatment of SSTR-\nnegative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NETs, or for second-\nline treatment after SSAs in patients with progressive dis-\nease. These studies included 34-49 patients with UKP-NETs\nor NETs of other origin not otherwise speciﬁed (see Sec-\ntion 5 of the Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nChT. In patients with progressive G2 (Ki-67 >10%) and G3\nNETs, alkylating agent-based and oxaliplatin-based ChT\nregimens may be considered. Most data for management of\nG3 NETs with these regimens are from patients with\npancreatic NETs, with response rates of up to 30% and\nmedian PFS of 8-16 months.48 Loss of O-6-methylguanine-\nDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression or promoter\nhypermethylation may prompt use of alkylating agent-\nbased ChT (see Section 5 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664).49,50 For the management of NECs, ﬁrst-line\ncarboplatineetoposide or cisplatineetoposide is recom-\nmended based on retrospective series showing response\nrates of 40%-60%, median PFS of 4-6 months and median\noverall survival (OS) of 12 months.2,10,21,29,51 Carboplatine\netoposide or cisplatineetoposide should not be used for\nwell-differentiated NETs, regardless of grade.33,51\nFigure 3.

PC occurs as a sporadic form, or less frequently as\nfamilial forms such as hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour\nsyndrome (HPT-JT; w15% of cases) linked to a germline\nmutation in the CDC73/HRPT2 gene.57 Rarely, it can occur as\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 (MEN1) or type\n2A (MEN2A).58 Even in the absence of a family history,\n20%-40% of patients with apparently sporadic PC have a\ngermline CDC73 mutation.58,59\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nDiagnosis.\nClinical presentation. PC can be suspected in patients\nwho present with severe primary hyperparathyroidism\ncharacterised by severe hypercalcaemia-related symptoms\nand markedly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.\nLess than 10% of patients have normal serum calcium and\nPTH levels and present with a non-functional PC with only\nlocal symptoms, such as a palpable cervical mass, hoarse-\nness, dysphagia or dyspnoea.60\nLaboratory studies. Most patients with PC have markedly\nhigh levels of calcium (>14 mg/dl or 3.5 mmol/l) and non-\nsuppressed intact PTH 1-84 molecule (3-10 times above the\nupper limit of normal). The combined presence of high\nserum calcium (>3 mmol/l) and a parathyroid lesion >3 cm\n(the so-called ‘>3, >3 rule’), should raise suspicion of PC.\nSome patients with PC may overproduce N-terminal PTH\nfragment and have elevated serum and urinary levels of\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin; their determination could\nbe useful for differential diagnosis with benign adenoma,\nalthough this has only been tested in a small series.61\nImaging. Neck US is the ﬁrst-line imaging technique for\nthe diagnosis of parathyroid lesions. Its sensitivity varies\nfrom 67% to 96% with a positive predictive value of 89.7%-\n97%62; however, there are no speciﬁc patterns of malig-\nnancy (see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with cytology and\nwashout PTH measurement can help to differentiate from\nlesions of other origins (e.g. thyroid, distant metastases\nfrom other tumours).63 Complications associated with the\nFNA procedure (including occasional seeding) are rare.64\nContrast-enhanced CT and MRI can be used in highly\nsuspicious cases to evaluate inﬁltration of surrounding tissue\nbut are not routinely carried out for differential diagnosis.65\nParathyroid\nscintigraphy\nwith\n[99mTc]Tc-sesta-methox-\nyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) single-photon emission CT (SPECT)\nor SPECTeCT, in combination with neck US, is the procedure\nof choice for preoperative identiﬁcation of hyperfunctioning\nparathyroids.

Nevertheless, there are\nno clear scintigraphic parameters that allow a real preoper-\native differential diagnosis between PC and adenoma.\nPET procedures such as [11C]-methionineePETeCT and\n[18F]-cholineePETeCT are effective for the diagnosis of pri-\nmary hyperparathyroidism but their added value in the dif-\nferential diagnosis between PC and adenoma is unknown.66\nPathology. Histological diagnosis of PC is based on the 2022\nWHO classiﬁcation criteria: (i) vascular invasion; (ii) lymphatic\ninvasion; (iii) perineural (intraneural) invasion; (iv) local ma-\nlignant invasion into adjacent anatomical structures; or (v)\nhistologically or cytologically documented metastatic disease.\nThe morphology of PC is usually reminiscent of parathyroid\nadenoma or hyperplasia.67,68 Features suggestive of malig-\nnancy and warranting a diagnosis of atypical adenoma [also\ncalled parathyroid neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential\nor atypical parathyroid tumour (APT)] are macroscopically\nevident necrosis, size >3 cm, weight >500 mg, mitotic index\n>5 mitoses/2 mm2 and the presence of atypical mitosis67,69\n(see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Some rare\nvariants have been described, including oncocytic carcinomas\nand carcinosarcomas with more aggressive behaviour.70,71\nAlthough PC generally shows a higher proliferation index\n(Ki-67 6%-9% compared with <4% in adenoma), there is no\npredeﬁned Ki-67 cut-off to support or exclude a PC diagnosis.\nThe International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)\nhas issued a dataset on PC and APT that covers PC grading,\nconsidering it high grade in the presence of sheets of pleo-\nmorphic enlarged nuclei, coagulative necrosis, abnormal\nmitosis and/or increased proliferation rate.69\nMolecular biology. The most frequent molecular alteration\nin PC is on the CDC73 gene (40%-50% of cases). Phospha-\ntidylinositol-3-kinase\n(PI3K)eprotein\nkinase\nb\n(AKT)e\nmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the most\nfrequently altered pathway (40%-80% of cases).65,72,73 IHC\nevaluation of paraﬁbromin loss of expression to identify a\ndouble-hit inactivation of the CDC73 gene is a recognised\nancillary diagnostic method for malignancy, as is evaluation\nof loss of p27, other types of cyclins or cell cycle regulators,\ngalectin-3 and protein gene product 9.5.69,74\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Genetic testing for germline CDC73 mutation should be\ncarried out to rule out HPT-JT in all patients with PC,\nincluding those without a family history [IV, A].\n\u0003 The combined presence of markedly elevated serum cal-\ncium [>12 mg/dl (>3 mmol/l)] and parathyroid lesions\n>3 cm should raise suspicion of PC [IV, B].\n\u0003 US of the neck should be carried out to assess lesions sus-\npicious for PC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are used to evaluate\nlocoregional invasion before planning surgery [V, A].\n\u0003 FNA cytology and washout PTH measurements can be\nused to differentiate PC from other neck or thyroid nod-\nules but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [V, C].\n\u0003 [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBIeSPECT may be useful for the diag-\nnosis of PC but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [IV, C].\n\u0003 PC pathology reporting should follow the 2022 WHO clas-\nsiﬁcation (ﬁfth edition) and ICCR template [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe prognosis for patients with PC is variable, with 5- and 10-\nyear OS rates after surgery of w80% and 40%-80%, respec-\ntively. Good prognosis is associated with early diagnosis and\nradicality of initial surgery, whereas poor prognosis is mainly\nrelated to older age and the presence of lymph node me-\ntastases.75-79\nStaging is based on the eighth edition of the American\nJoint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system (see\nSupplementary Table S11, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).80 Only 15%-30% of patients\nhave level VI lymph node metastases and one-third have\ndistant metastases, most commonly in the lung, liver or\nbone. The detection of locoregional or distant metastases is\nbased on neck US, thoracic and abdominal CT, or MRI.\nAmong nuclear medicine techniques, total body acquisi-\ntion with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI can identify possible extra-\ncervical uptake and unexpected lesions. FDGePETeCT can\nalso be applied as PC generally shows high FDG uptake. It\ncan be used to complement conventional imaging in the\ninitial staging and for residual or relapsing disease, albeit\nbased on limited data.81 Other PET tracers such as [11C]-\nmethionineePETeCT and [18F]-cholineePETeCT have not\nbeen validated for routine staging of PC.66,81,82\nRecommendations\n\u0003 PC staging should follow the eighth edition of the AJCC\nTNM system [IV, A].\n\u0003 Cross-sectional imaging is the reference method [V, A] but\nadditional FDGePETeCT may improve staging accuracy\n[IV, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nManagement of hypercalcaemia. Medical management of\nhypercalcaemia is the main treatment for patients awaiting\nsurgery and those with inoperable PC. Cinacalcet, a potent\nsecond-generation calcium mimetic, is effective for con-\ntrolling hypercalcaemia in patients with inoperable or\npersistent disease.83,84 The greatest reductions in calcium\nwere reported in patients with the highest serum calcium\nlevels before therapy. The cornerstones of treatment for\nsevere or symptomatic hypercalcaemia are intravenous sa-\nline hydration and bisphosphonate administration (see\nSection 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nSurgery. Surgery is the recommended ﬁrst-line treatment\nfor PC (Figure 6).85 Inadequate and non-radical surgery\nrepresent the strongest prognostic factors for recurrence\nand mortality. In case of high suspicion of PC, en bloc\nremoval of the parathyroid lesion avoiding capsule rupture\nand local seeding, homolateral thyroid lobo-isthmectomy\nand central node dissection are recommended.86\nESMO Open\nJ. Hadoux et al.\n10\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\n\n---\nRT. Analysis of data from the National Cancer Database\nidentiﬁed 885 patients with PC who underwent surgery\nbetween 2004 and 2016, including 126 (14.2%) who also\nreceived external beam RT. The latter group had a higher\nfrequency of extensive regional disease, nodal metastases\nand residual microscopic disease. The 5-year OS rate was\n85.3% with a median follow-up of 60.8 months. RT was not\nassociated with a difference in OS based on multivariate\nanalysis87; however, small series from highly specialised\ntertiary centres have reported lower locoregional relapse\nrates in patients undergoing adjuvant RT,88-90 particularly in\npatients with R1 or R2 resection.90 Although not recom-\nmended for all patients, adjuvant RT should be discussed in\nthe case of R1 or R2 resection and/or lymph node metas-\ntasis (Nþ) and/or persistent hypercalcaemia.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Medical treatment of hypercalcaemia is required before\nsurgery [V, A].\n\u0003 Cinacalcet is recommended to control hypercalcaemia [II,\nA].\n\u0003 Hydration with saline infusion, at a starting dose of 200-\n500 ml/h, is the ﬁrst step in the treatment of severe or\nsymptomatic hypercalcaemia [IV, A].\n\u0003 The bone antiresorptive drug zoledronic acid is recom-\nmended as ﬁrst-line treatment and should be preferred\nover pamidronate for severe or symptomatic hypercalcae-\nmia [II, A].\n\u0003 Denosumab is recommended in patients with resistant\nhypercalcaemia [III, A; FDA approved, not EMA approved].\n\u0003 When a preoperative diagnosis of PC is made, upfront\nsurgery with en bloc removal of the parathyroid lesion\n(avoiding capsule rupture and local seeding), homolateral\nthyroid lobo-isthmectomy and central node dissection is\nrecommended [IV, A].\n\u0003 In case of pathological diagnosis of PC after parathyroid-\nectomy,\nreoperation\nwith\nipsilateral\nthyroid\nlobo-\nisthectomy and\ncentral node\ndissection\nshould\nbe\ndiscussed within 1 month of initial surgery [IV, A].\nFigure 6.

Brown\ntumours (osteolytic lesions of the bone caused by hyper-\nparathyroidism) should be differentiated from bone me-\ntastases, but this may be difﬁcult as they can show FDG\nuptake; MRI can be useful to better characterise bone le-\nsions.91 In case of known distant metastases, the probability\nof achieving a complete response is low and frequently only\nlocoregional treatments can control the disease.92 Cina-\ncalcet should be continued in case of persistent severe\nhypercalcaemia.\nData on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in PC are\nscarce with only 79 patients reported in the literature be-\ntween 1898 and 2018.93 A recent pooled analysis of all\nmetastatic PC cases reported that the most frequent\ntreatments were dacarbazine or anthracycline-containing\nChT and antiangiogenic drugs.93 The most frequent ChT\nprotocols included dacarbazine monotherapy, dacarbazinee\n5-FU, cyclophosphamide monotherapy or methotrexatee\ndoxorubicinecyclophosphamideelomustine, but response\nrates were low.93 Most cases in which antiangiogenics were\nused involved sorafenib.94,95 PC is usually radioresistant;\ndespite limited data showing that RT can be applied as\nadjuvant therapy to reduce local recurrence, its role is\nmainly palliative.85\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The efﬁcacy of systemic treatment in advanced and met-\nastatic disease is limited; thus, whenever possible,\ndebulking surgery and/or locoregional treatments should\nbe discussed to control tumour burden and hormonal\nsecretion [V, A].\n\u0003 First-line systemic treatment may involve antiangiogenic\ndrugs [V, B] or alkylating agent-based ChT (dacarbazine,\ntemozolomide or streptozocin combined with 5-FU or\ncapecitabine) [V, C].\n\u0003 Inclusion in clinical trials should be prioritised whenever\npossible [V, A].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nThe reported risk of recurrence is w50% at 2-5 years (based\nmainly\non\ncases\nin\nwhich\nnon-radical\nsurgery\nwas\nused).56,75-77,79 Laboratory follow-up includes lifelong mea-\nsurement of calcium and PTH every 3 months, although\nlonger intervals (up to 4-6 months) are an option.79 Pro-\ngressive and repeated increases in PTH and calcium levels\nare suggestive of PC recurrence and cross-sectional imaging\n(neck US, CT and/or MRI) should be carried out to identify\nthe site of recurrence. There is no validated role for scin-\ntigraphy with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI in the follow-up of PC.\nRecurrences and distant metastases can be small or\nbelow the resolution of imaging (<1 cm), and occasionally\nPC can evolve towards aggressive and rapidly progressive\nforms and lose the ability for signiﬁcant uptake of [99mTc]Tc-\nsesta-MIBI. In these cases, FDGePET can complement\nconventional imaging.\nThe identiﬁcation of a germline CDC73 mutation should\nprompt periodic screening for tumours associated with HPT-\nJT (ossifying ﬁbromas of the mandible or maxilla, benign\nand malignant uterine involvement, renal cysts).58 Genetic\ntesting should be carried out in all family members of\naffected individuals. In ﬁrst-degree relatives, measurement\nof\nserum\ncalcium\nlevels\nand\nUS\nmonitoring\nare\nrecommended.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Lifelong laboratory follow-up, including measurement of\ncalcium and PTH, is recommended every 3-4 months\nduring the ﬁrst 2 years, every 6 months during the sub-\nsequent 3 years and annually thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 In case of calcium and/or PTH elevation, neck US and CT\nscan of the neck, chest and abdomen together with a\nneck MRI are recommended [V, A]. FDGePET can be pro-\nposed to complete work-up, especially in rapidly pro-\ngressing cases [V, C].\nINTRATHYROID THYMIC CARCINOMA\nIncidence and epidemiology\nPreviously known as carcinoma showing thymus-like dif-\nferentiation (CASTLE), intrathyroid thymic carcinoma (ITC) is\nrare and believed to arise from the thymic remnants or\nbranchial pouch96 and, more rarely, from major salivary\nglands.97 ITC accounts for <0.15% of thyroid neoplasms.98\nFemales are affected slightly more frequently than males\nand the median age at diagnosis is 50 years.99\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nITC presents as a slow-growing neck mass with hard con-\nsistency and poor mobility, located at the lower poles of the\nthyroid gland. It appears as a cold nodule on thyroid scin-\ntigraphy and as a solid, heterogenous and hypoechoic mass\non US. Most patients have locally advanced disease with\ninvasion of surrounding structures, including the recurrent\nlaryngeal nerve, strap muscle, trachea, oesophagus, soft\ntissues and skin. Cervical lymph nodes are frequently\ninvolved but few patients have distant metastases.99 At\ndiagnosis, w20% of patients have dyspnoea, dysphagia,\nright laryngeal nerve paralysis and pain. FNA does not\nprovide a deﬁnitive diagnosis; histological conﬁrmation is\nwarranted.\nITC exhibits histological and immunophenotypic re-\nsemblances to eutopic thymic carcinoma. The tumour cells\ngenerally grow in a solid or nested pattern, identical to\nsquamous-cell carcinoma arising in the thymus. Positive IHC\nresults for cluster of differentiation (CD)5, CD117 and p63\nsuggest\na\ndiagnosis\nof\nITC\n(see\nSection\n8\nof\nthe\nSupplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\nESMO Open\nJ. Hadoux et al.\n12\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\n\n---\n1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Similar to thymomas and\nthymic carcinoma, on comparative genomic hybridisation\nITC is characterised by chromosomal imbalances such as\ngains on chromosomal arm 1q and losses on 6p, 6q and\n16q.100 The most frequently altered gene is the telomerase\nreverse transcriptase promoter mutation C228T, identiﬁed\nin 22% of cases.101 EGFR mutations have been docu-\nmented102 but their prevalence cannot be estimated due to\nthe limited number of cases analysed.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 ITC should be suspected in the presence of a cold nodule\nin the lower lobes of the thyroid gland with a cytological\ndiagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma [V, A].\n\u0003 Positive IHC for CD5, CD117 and p63 may allow for a pre-\noperative diagnosis [V, B].\n\u0003 Histological features that allow for a post-operative diag-\nnosis of ITC are lymphoid stroma, squamous-cell differen-\ntiation, infrequent mitoses and rare necrosis, positive IHC\nfor CD5, CD117 and p63, negative IHC for thyroglobulin,\nTTF-1 and calcitonin, and Ki-67 <20% [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nDisease stage is the main prognostic factor. Application of\nthe eighth edition of the UICC staging classiﬁcation25 for\nthyroid tumours is recommended, even if not speciﬁc for\nITC (see Supplementary Table S12, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Neck US, CT of the\nneck, thorax and abdomen, and neck MRI can be used for\nstaging. On CT, ITC appears as a well-deﬁned soft tissue\ndensity without calciﬁcation, whereas on MRI, it appears as\nan isointense and hyperintense mass on T1/T2-weighted\nimages.103 Similar to thymoma, ITC can show intense up-\ntake on FDGePETeCT; however, data on the use of FDGe\nPETeCT in patients with ITC are very limited.104\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Accurate assessment of local extension with US or MRI is\ncrucial for planning appropriate surgical intervention\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 CT of the chest and abdomen should be carried out to\nrule out the rare possibility of distant synchronous metas-\ntasis [V, A]. Complementary FDGePETeCT may be useful\nin some cases [V, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nSurgery is the treatment of choice (Figure 7). A pooled\nanalysis of published cases99 showed that thyroidectomy\n(total, subtotal or near total) was the most frequent surgical\nprocedure. Due to frequent nodal involvement at diagnosis,\nneck lymph node dissection [i.e. modiﬁed radical neck\ndissection (levels I-V), selective neck dissection of central\ncompartment (level VI) or lateral selective neck dissection\n(levels II-IV)] was carried out in >55% of cases. Among\npatients with a small ITC, 40% underwent thyroid lobec-\ntomy without lymph node dissection. RT was used in only\ntwo cases of locally advanced ITC not amenable to surgery\nwith radical intent.\nThe prognosis for patients with local or locoregional\ndisease is very good. In the pooled analysis,99 estimated\nmedian disease-free survival was 144 months (range 91-197\nmonths), median OS was not reached and w85% of\nFigure 7.

Based on these data,\nsurgery is recommended as the ﬁrst-line therapeutic option\nin patients with ITC with locoregional disease. The type of\nsurgery (i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be plan-\nned according to the available guideline for thyroid can-\ncers,28 using conservative surgical treatment whenever\npossible. Adjuvant RT does not improve prognosis and can\nbe avoided in most patients, although it may be discussed\nfor more advanced or aggressive cases. There is no role for\nadjuvant ChT. Patients with locoregional disease not\namenable to surgery with radical intent could be offered RT\nor chemoradiotherapy (CRT).\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Surgery is the mainstay of therapy. The type of surgery\n(i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be planned ac-\ncording to the available guidelines for thyroid cancers\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 Due to the indolent course of the disease and its good\nprognosis, conservative surgical treatment is preferred\nwhenever possible [V, B].\n\u0003 Neck dissection should be carried out according to guide-\nlines for thyroid cancers [V, A].\n\u0003 RT or CRT are reasonable options in case of locally\nadvanced disease not suitable for radical surgery [V, B].\n\u0003 If possible, adjuvant RT should be avoided due to the\nindolent disease course of ITC [IV, D]. It is an option in\nselected cases after careful multidisciplinary discussion\n[IV, B].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nAmong 120 patients with ITC who underwent primary\ntumour resection, 29 (24%) experienced recurrence at a\nmedian of 19 months (range 13-25 months).99 The recur-\nrence was locoregional in 21 patients (72%), and was\ntreated surgically in 90% and using RT in 42% of cases, with\nexcellent prognosis. A minority (w10%) of patients devel-\noped distant metastases; ﬁve patients (4%) had metastases\nat diagnosis and eight (6%) developed metachronous\ndistant metastases. The most common metastatic site was\nthe lung. Data on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in\npatients with metastatic ITC are limited. Similar to the\nrecommendations for locally advanced or metastatic thy-\nmoma or thymic carcinoma,28 cisplatin-containing regimens\nhave been used in most ITC cases, with a reported objective\nremission rate of 58%.99 Immunotherapy with the immune\ncheckpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab was used in one case,\nresulting in long-lasting disease control. Based on this single\nexperience, it is not possible to recommend immuno-\ntherapy for the treatment of metastatic ITC.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In case of local recurrence, salvage surgery is recommen-\nded [IV, A] and adjuvant RT may be discussed by an MTB\nfor patients who have not received prior RT [V, B].\n\u0003 In case of metastatic disease, cisplatin-based combination\nChT regimens with either doxorubicin and cyclophospha-\nmide or etoposide are the recommended options [V, B].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up is aimed at identifying locoregional recurrences\nand, more rarely, distant recurrences, usually within the ﬁrst\n5 years after initial treatment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In localised disease, neck US and CT scan of the neck and\nthorax are recommended 6-12 months after initial treat-\nment and then annually up to 5 years [V, C].\n\u0003 In metastatic disease, follow-up by CT and/or MRI (in case\nof liver, bone or brain metastases) every 3-6 months is rec-\nommended, depending on the tumour growth rate [V, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG was developed in accordance with the ESMO\nstandard\noperating\nprocedures\nfor\nCPG\ndevelopment\n(https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-\nMethodology).

Die Diagnose wurde histologisch bestätigt. Die Patientin ist 65 Jahre alt und hat eine relevante Komorbidität (chronische Niereninsuffizienz). Die Symptome (Schwäche, Müdigkeit, Übelkeit) sind wahrscheinlich auf die Hyperkalzämie und den fortgeschrittenen Tumor zurückzuführen. Die chronische Niereninsuffizienz erschwert die Behandlung der Hyperkalzämie und die Wahl systemischer Therapien. Die Prognose für Patienten mit metastasiertem Parathyreoidkarzinom ist generell schlecht, die mediane Überlebenszeit liegt bei etwa 12 Monaten.\n\nDie primären Behandlungsziele sind die Kontrolle der Hyperkalzämie, die Linderung der Symptome und die Verlängerung des Überlebens. Eine kurative Behandlung ist aufgrund der fortgeschrittenen Erkrankung nicht möglich.\n</beurteilung>\n\n<therapieempfehlung>\n1.  **Management der Hyperkalzämie:**\n    *   **Intravenöse Hydratation:** Aggressive intravenöse Hydratation mit isotoner Kochsalzlösung (0,9% NaCl) zur Förderung der Kalziumausscheidung und zur Korrektur der Dehydrierung. Die Infusionsrate sollte an den Urinoutput und den Kalziumspiegel angepasst werden.\n    *   **Bisphosphonate:** Intravenöse Gabe von Zoledronsäure (4 mg) oder Pamidronsäure (60-90 mg) zur Hemmung der Osteoklastenaktivität und zur Senkung des Kalziums. Aufgrund der chronischen Niereninsuffizienz (CKD) ist die Dosis anzupassen und die Nierenfunktion engmaschig zu überwachen. Zoledronsäure ist bei CKD bis zu einem GFR von 30 ml/min/1,73 m² anwendbar, Pamidronsäure ist bei GFR < 30 ml/min/1,73 m² kontraindiziert.\n    *   **Denosumab:** Eine Alternative zu Bisphosphonaten, insbesondere bei schwerer Niereninsuffizienz (GFR < 30 ml/min/1,73 m²). Eine einmalige subkutane Injektion von 120 mg.\n    *   **Calcitonin:** Kann zur schnellen, aber kurzfristigen Senkung des Kalziums eingesetzt werden (z.B. 4 U i.v. alle 12 Stunden für 48 Stunden). Die Wirkung lässt schnell nach (Tachyphylaxie).\n    *   **Glukokortikoide:** Können bei Hyperkalzämie im Zusammenhang mit malignen Erkrankungen (z.B. durch Reduzierung der Vitamin-D-Synthese und Hemmung der Osteoklasten) eingesetzt werden, insbesondere wenn andere Maßnahmen versagen.\n    *   **Dialyse:** Bei schwerer, refraktärer Hyperkalzämie oder bei Patienten mit schwerer Niereninsuffizienz kann eine Hämodialyse zur schnellen Senkung des Kalziums erforderlich sein.\n\n2.  **Systemische Therapie:**\n    *   **Chemotherapie:** Es gibt keine standardisierte, effektive Chemotherapie für Parathyreoidkarzinom. Platinbasierte Regime (z.B. Cisplatin, Carboplatin) oder Taxane (z.B. Paclitaxel, Docetaxel) können in Kombination mit anderen Wirkstoffen versucht werden, haben aber nur begrenzte Wirksamkeit und erhebliche Toxizität. Die Wahl der Chemotherapie sollte unter Berücksichtigung der Nierenfunktion und des Allgemeinzustands der Patientin erfolgen.\n    *   **Targeted Therapy:**\n        *   **Kinaseinhibitoren:** Es gibt Hinweise darauf, dass Kinaseinhibitoren (z.B. Sunitinib, Sorafenib) bei Parathyreoidkarzinom eine gewisse Aktivität haben könnten, aber die Datenlage ist begrenzt.\n        *   **mTOR-Inhibitoren:** Everolimus hat in einigen Fallberichten eine Aktivität gezeigt.\n        *   **PARP-Inhibitoren:** Bei Patienten mit BRCA-Mutationen könnten PARP-Inhibitoren eine Option sein, dies erfordert jedoch eine entsprechende molekulargenetische Testung.\n    *   **Immuntherapie:** Checkpoint-Inhibitoren (z.B. Pembrolizumab, Nivolumab) haben in einigen Fallberichten eine Aktivität gezeigt, insbesondere bei Patienten mit PD-L1-Expression. Die Datenlage ist jedoch begrenzt und eine Standardindikation besteht nicht.\n    *   **Experimentelle Therapien:** Teilnahme an klinischen Studien sollte in Betracht gezogen werden.\n\n3.  **Lokale Therapie:**\n    *   **Chirurgie:** Eine Resektion des Primärtumors und/oder der Metastasen ist in der Regel nicht kurativ, kann aber zur Linderung lokaler Symptome (z.B. Atemnot durch Lungenmetastasen) oder zur Kontrolle der Hyperkalzämie beitragen. Eine Parathyreoidektomie kann bei persistierender Hyperkalzämie trotz systemischer Therapie erwogen werden.\n    *   **Strahlentherapie:** Kann zur Linderung lokaler Symptome (z.B. Schmerzen durch Knochenmetastasen, Atemnot durch Lungenmetastasen) eingesetzt werden.\n\n4.  **Supportive Therapie:**\n    *   **Schmerzmanagement:** Analgetika entsprechend dem Schmerzlevel.\n    *   **Ernährungsberatung:** Unterstützung bei der Aufrechterhaltung des Ernährungszustands.\n    *   **Psychosoziale Unterstützung:** Beratung und Unterstützung für die Patientin und ihre Angehörigen.\n    *   **Palliativmedizinische Betreuung:** Frühzeitige Einbindung eines Palliativmedizin-Teams zur Optimierung der Symptomkontrolle und zur Unterstützung bei Entscheidungen.\n\n**Empfohlene Vorgehensweise:**\n\n1.  **Initiales Management der Hyperkalzämie:** Aggressive intravenöse Hydratation und Gabe von Zoledronsäure (Dosis an GFR anpassen) oder Denosumab. Engmaschige Überwachung von Kalzium, Nierenfunktion und Elektrolyten.\n2.  **Systemische Therapie:** Aufgrund der begrenzten Wirksamkeit etablierter Therapien und der Komorbiditäten der Patientin sollte eine sorgfältige Abwägung erfolgen. Eine Option wäre die Teilnahme an einer klinischen Studie. Alternativ könnte eine Chemotherapie mit einem Platin-basierten Regime (z.B. Carboplatin) in Betracht gezogen werden, wobei die Toxizität und die Nierenfunktion berücksichtigt werden müssen. Eine palliative Chemotherapie sollte das Ziel haben, die Symptome zu lindern und die Lebensqualität zu verbessern.\n3.  **Lokale Therapie:** Eine Resektion des Primärtumors ist in der Regel nicht indiziert, es sei denn, es besteht eine signifikante Kompression oder eine andere Indikation. Eine Strahlentherapie kann zur Linderung lokaler Symptome eingesetzt werden.\n4.  **Palliativmedizinische Betreuung:** Frühzeitige Einbindung eines Palliativmedizin-Teams zur Optimierung der Symptomkontrolle, zur Unterstützung bei Entscheidungen und zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualität.\n</beurteilung>\n\n<therapieempfehlung>\n1.  **Management der Hyperkalzämie:**\n    *   Intravenöse Hydratation mit isotoner Kochsalzlösung (0,9% NaCl) mit Ziel einer Urinproduktion von > 2 l/Tag.\n    *   Gabe von Zoledronsäure 4 mg i.v.

Both malignancies are rare. ACC has an estimated\nincidence of w0.5-2 new cases per million people per year.1,2\nPhaeochromocytomas are catecholamine-producing neuro-\nendocrine tumours arising from chromafﬁn cells of the\nadrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia. The latter are\nusually called paraganglioma, leading to the combined term\nphaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs). The\ndetected incidence of PPGLs is commonly reported at 2-8 per\nmillion per year3 (supplementary information, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).\nAll patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL\nshould be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team\nmeeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis (ideally\nbefore surgery) and in case of progressive disease.\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nEvery patient with (suspected) ACC or PPGL should undergo\ncareful clinical assessment, including case history, clinical\nexamination for symptoms and signs of adrenal hormone\nexcess. For more details on this topic, we refer to more\ncomprehensive guidelines and reviews.3-8\nHormonal evaluation\nThe aims of hormonal evaluation are multiple: (i) hormone\nassays provide orientation to the nature of the adrenal\nmass and can be useful to assess presence of malignancy;\n(ii) a phaeochromocytoma should always be ruled out,\nbecause these tumours can induce life-threatening crises,\nrequiring speciﬁc management before any intervention; (iii)\nmassive adrenocortical steroid excess can impact short-\nterm survival and quality of life (QoL), requiring speciﬁc\ntreatments to block impacts of hormonal excess; (iv)\nabnormal hormone secretions may serve as biological\nmarkers for the follow-up of patients; (v) in case of large\nbilateral adrenal masses, a systematic assessment of adre-\nnal function is recommended to rule out adrenal insufﬁ-\nciency. Precise hormone assays have been detailed in recent\nguideline statements,4,5,9,10 and are summarised in Table 1.\nFor all adrenal masses, the diagnosis of phaeochro-\nmocytoma\nshould\nbe\nsystematically\nassessed\nby\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: June 2020.

For differential diag-\nnosis of an adrenal mass, computed tomography (CT) and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both effective [IV, A].\nAlthough these methods cannot determine the exact entity\nof the mass, both are able to correctly diagnose a subset of\nbenign tumoursdat least when carried out according to\nstate-of-the-art criteria. The single best criterion to diagnose\na benign tumour (e.g. adenoma) remains Hounsﬁeld units\n\u000210 in an unenhanced CT.17 However, other imaging\ncriteria, such as rapid washout in 10- or 15-min delayed\ncontrast-enhanced CT, signal intensity loss using opposed-\nphase MRI, and low 2-ﬂuorine-18 [18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-\nglucose (FDG) uptake in [18F]FDG-positron electron to-\nmography (PET)/CT are also suggestive of a benign tumour.\nMost ACCs show an inhomogeneous appearance in CT or\nMRI with irregular margins and irregular enhancement of\nsolid components after intravenous injection of contrasted\nagent. Detection of local invasion or tumour extension into\nthe inferior vena cava, as well as lymph node or other\nmetastasesdincluding lung and liverdis mandatory before\nplanning any surgery. Therefore, cross-sectional imaging\nof the chest, abdomen and pelvis is required preoperatively\n[V, A].\nFor PPGLs, conventional radiological imaging can be\nimportant to determine the presence of metastases. How-\never, neither CT nor MRI can be used to determine whether\nPPGLs are benign or malignant. Malignancy can only be\ndetermined from the presence of metastatic lesions at sites\nwhere chromafﬁn cells are normally absent. Without such\nevidence, all PPGLs should be considered potentially ma-\nlignant, with risk dependent on several factors as outlined\nbelow.\nThere are a number of functional imaging modalities\navailable for patients with PPGLs (supplementary File,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). The indication is twofold: (i) best tumour staging in\npatients with suspected metastases (e.g. by conventional\nimaging) or with presumably high risk for metastases; (ii) to\nevaluate the option of a radionuclide-based therapy in pa-\ntients with nonresectable PPGL. For assessments of meta-\nstatic risk for the ﬁrst indication the authors suggest the\npresence of one or more of the following criteria:\n\u0003 tumour size \u00045 cm;\n\u0003 any extra-adrenal paraganglioma;\n\u0003 known succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur\nsubunit B (SDHB) germline mutation; or\n\u0003 plasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above\nthe upper cut-offs of reference intervals.\nFor imaging-based diagnosis of metastatic PPGLs, it is\nimportant to avoid confusing metastases with multiple\nprimary tumours that often occur in patients with heredi-\ntary PPGL syndromes. Additionally, local recurrences should\nnot be misdiagnosed as metastases.\nPathology\nBiopsy of adrenal tumours is usually contraindicated\nbecause of the risk of tumour spillage, poor diagnostic po-\nwer to discriminate benign from malignant adrenocortical\ntumours and risk of hypertensive crises in phaeochromo-\ncytoma. However, a biopsy might be indicated in an adrenal\nmass without any hormone excess in patients with a history\nof extra-adrenal cancers to exclude or prove an adrenal\nmetastasis of an extra-adrenal malignancy, and in patients\nin whom tumour sequencing is desired.\nThe pathological differential diagnosis of adrenal neo-\nplasias in both biopsied and resected specimens is primarily\nbased on morphological features requiring an experienced\npathologist [IV, A]. Preferably, a panel of immunohisto-\nchemical markers should be applied to aid diagnosis; for\nexample, steroidogenesis factor 1 (SF1) or, alternatively,\ninhibin-alpha, calretinin and melan-A for identiﬁcation of\nadrenocortical tumours and chromogranin A for identiﬁca-\ntion of PPGL [IV, A]. Staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and\nsynaptophysin may also be helpful to highlight PPGL, but\npositive results for synaptophysin are also possible in\nadrenocortical tumours. The differential diagnosis between\nACC and adenoma may be challenging as no single marker\nindicates malignancy. The most widely used diagnostic score\nhas been introduced by Weiss18,19 and includes nine pa-\nrameters (supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099) [IV, A]. A score of \u00043\nsuggests malignancy. In addition, the Ki-67 labelling index,\nas a marker of proliferative activity, may be useful and is\nvery\nhelpful\nfor\nprognostic\npurposes\n(supplementary\nTables S2 and S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nannonc.2020.08.2099).\nFor phaeochromocytomas, the situation is similarly\ndemanding. Tumour size, SDHB mutation status, extra-\nadrenal location and plasma methoxytyramine may all be\nused to indicate riskof metastasis. However,there is no single\nhistological or immunohistochemical parameter that can\npredict the clinical behaviour of PPGL. Nevertheless, several\nhistological scoring systems have been developed.20-23 All\nthese scores have value but none of them has reached\ngeneral acceptance. Therefore, according to the current\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcation, all PPGLs\nshould be considered to have some malignant potential.24 A\ndeﬁnitive diagnosis of malignancy can only be made by the\npresence of metastases at sites where chromafﬁn tissue is\nnormally absent (e.g. liver, bone, lungs or lymph nodes),\nassessed by pathology or imaging, in particular functional\nimaging.\nM. Fassnacht et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 11\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099\n1477\n\n---\nMolecular biology\nMolecular characterisation of ACC (supplementary File,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099) and PPGL is an active area of ongoing research. The\ngene encoding subunit B of the SDHB complex is by far the\nmost important molecular contributor to malignant PPGL,\nwith at least 40% of all cases of metastatic PPGLs carrying\nmutations of this gene.25 Inactivation of SDHB reduces\nfunction of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, leading\nto activation of the hypoxia-inducible pathway and a\npseudohypoxic state characterised by increased angiogen-\nesis, growth and expression of mitogenic factors,26 but also\nto DNA hypermethylation, which is believed to provide a\nfurther drive to metastatic progression.27\nAt least 35% of PPGLs result from germline mutations of\nover 18 tumour-susceptibility genes identiﬁed to date,28-33\nwith those resulting in stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible fac-\ntors 1a and 2a (HIF1a and HIF2a) carrying a higher risk of\nmetastatic disease than those due to other mutations\n(supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). Risk is particularly high, reach-\ning 70% in patients with PPGL due to mutations in the SDHB\ngene.34 The vast majority of all metastatic PPGLs, including\ndisease due to SDHB mutations, develop from noradrenergic\nor dopaminergic PPGLs with poorly developed secretory\npathways.

Recent data suggest\nthat lymph node involvement correlates with stage IV\nrather than stage III behaviour.37\nOverall, the prognosis of ACC is limited. However, pro-\nspective data suggest that in patients with complete\nresection of a localised stage II tumour 5-year overall sur-\nvival (OS) can be as high as 90%.38 In metastatic ACC, me-\ndian survival is about 15 months. However, even in this\ngroup, there is a subgroup of patients with long-term\nsurvival.36,37\nIt is well established that disease stage and margin-free\nresection are currently the most important prognostic fac-\ntors in ACC. For the European Society of Endocrinology\n(ESE)eENSAT guidelines, a comprehensive literature search\nfor prognostic factors has been carried out and only the\nproliferation marker Ki-67 and glucocorticoid excess showed\na robust association with prognosis [IV, A] (supplementary\nTable S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.\n08.2099).4,39 Many other (molecular) markers for aggres-\nsiveness and survival have been recently proposed, but their\nclinical use requires validation.\nPPGL\nIn 2017,the WHO proposed a tumourstaging system for PPGL\n(supplementary Table S6, available at https://doi.org/10.1\n016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).24 Although this staging classi-\nﬁcation remains to be validated, the authors recommend\nusing this system to harmonise disease classiﬁcation.\nDespite limitations, the authors suggest assessing the risk\nof metastatic disease in an individualised manner, taking into\naccount previous history of disease and the presence or\nabsence of a germline mutation of a tumour-susceptibility\ngene (supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/\n10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). For ﬁrst-time patients\nwithout any history of disease or known mutation, size and\nlocation of the primary tumour, and when available, any el-\nevations of plasma methoxytyramine during biochemical\ntesting seem important to consider when evaluating risk\nfor malignancy. As described above, the authors suggest\nestablishing ‘high risk of metastases’ when any patient pre-\nsents with one or more of the following criteria: (i) adrenal\nphaeochromocytoma \u00045 cm; (ii) an extra-adrenal para-\nganglioma; (iii) a known SDHB germline mutation; or (iv)\nplasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above the\nupper limit of reference intervals. In these patients, whole-\nbody functional imaging may be justiﬁed, particularly for\ncases involving more than one of those four criteria.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The ENSAT TNM system should be used for initial staging\nof ACC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Genetic counselling should be offered to all patients with\nPPGL.\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nSurgery\nSurgery is essential for treatment of both ACC and phaeo-\nchromocytoma.

The\nlack of consensus on what is deﬁned as appropriate expe-\nrience and the absence of evidence that a speciﬁc experi-\nence in adrenal surgery translates into improved outcomes\nlimit any recommendations concerning this issue.40-42 The\nrecent ESEeENSAT guidelines on ACC suggest a minimal\nannual workload of six adrenalectomies per year, but with\na preference for >20 surgeries per year. In addition to\nexpertise in adrenal surgery, sufﬁcient experience in onco-\nlogical surgery is essential [V, B].4 For best clinical outcome,\nthe entire operative team (including anaesthesiologists)\nshould be well-trained in adrenal surgery.\nM.

Therefore, a\nmargin-free complete resection (R0 resection) is key to\nachieving long-term survival [V, A].2,44 In order to obtain an\nR0 resection of a locally advanced ACC, it may be necessary\nto resect (parts of) adjacent organs such as the wall of the\nvena cava, liver, spleen, colon, pancreas and/or stomach [V,\nB]. Complete en bloc resection of the tumoural mass,\nincluding periadrenal fat and adjacent organs if necessary, is\nmandatory to avoid tumour rupture or spillage that por-\ntends an adverse outcome.45 Locoregional lymphadenec-\ntomy improves tumour staging and seems to lead to a\nfavourable oncological outcome.46\nRoutine lymphadenectomy should include at least the\nperiadrenal and hilar nodes [IV, A], although the best extent\nFigure 2.

One study with 207 patients\n(including 88 with mitotane) found that adjuvant mitotane\nwas associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS)50;\nhowever, the mitotane group was likely selected for a higher\nrisk of recurrence, a bias that cannot be fully adjusted for in\nmultivariate analysis.\nProbably, the best evidence supporting adjuvant mitotane\nuse comes from a multicentre, case-control study that cir-\ncumvented confounders by comparing patient groups treated\nat centres adopting two different treatment strategies. The\nstudy involved 177 patients, of whom 47 were followed in\nItalian reference centres that systematically adopted adjuvant\nmitotane to all radically operated ACC. Fifty-ﬁve Italian pa-\ntients and 75 German patients were followed in institutions\nnot administering adjuvant mitotane therapy.51 The outcome\nof this cohort has been recently updated, conﬁrming that the\nmitotane-treated patients have prolonged RFS compared with\npatients left untreated after surgery.52\nTwo recent meta-analyses have reported that adjuvant\nmitotane treatment reduces the risk of recurrence and\ndeath.4,53 In both analyses, the beneﬁt associated with mito-\ntane was signiﬁcant forOS, whereas itwas signiﬁcant forRFS in\nonly one study.53 Another retrospective multicentre study\ndemonstrated that blood mitotane concentrations \u000414 mg/l\nwere associated with a prolonged RFS in patients treated with\nadjuvant mitotane following macroscopically radical surgery.54\nOn these bases, the recent ESEeENSAT guidelines on the\nmanagement of ACC suggest that patients at high risk of\nrecurrence (stage III, or R1-RX resection, and/or Ki-67 index\n>10%) should be offered adjuvant mitotane [IV, B].4 By\ncontrast, adjuvant therapy has to be discussed on an individual\nbasis in patients fulﬁlling all the following criteria: stage I or II\ndisease, histologicallyproven R0 resection and Ki-67expressed\nin \u000210% of neoplastic cells, which deﬁne the category of low\nrisk of recurrence [V, B] (Figure 1).4 For these patients, the\nresults of the still ongoing randomised ADIUVO trial55 testing\nthe efﬁcacy of adjuvant mitotane therapy are awaited.\nThere are no data regarding the optimal duration of\nadjuvant mitotane; however, the authors recommend that\nadjuvant mitotane should be administered for at least 2\nyears [V, B], because the greatest frequency of disease\nrecurrence is expected within this time frame. However, it is\nnot advised to continue adjuvant mitotane beyond 5 years,\ndue to the low number of ACC recurrences occurring after\nthis time [V, B].4\nAdjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is able to reduce the risk of\nlocal recurrence but does not prevent distant recurrences\nand, as a consequence, does not impact OS.4 Therefore, it is\nreasonable to associate mitotane with RT in selected pa-\ntients with stage III ACC and/or R1 or RX resection, although\nthe combination carries increased toxicity [IV, B].4\nThe adjuvant use of cytotoxic drugs is not well established\nin ACC. Nevertheless, some centres are beginning to apply\ncytotoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin plus etoposide) in selected\npatients with very high riskof recurrence and this approach is\nbeing investigated in a randomised trial (NCT03583710).\nSpecial considerations on mitotane. Mitotane is a difﬁcult\ndrug to manage, with a long half-life, dose-limiting toxicity\nand a narrow therapeutic window.

AsinACC,thesurgicalexcisionofthetumouristheﬁrst-\nline treatment of PPGLs (Figure 2). However, laparoscopic/\nminimal invasive surgery is commonly the technique of ﬁrst\nchoice for resection adrenal and extra-adrenal PPGLs [V, A],\nbecause local invasion is rare and the likelihood of rupture of\nthe capsule seems less common than in ACC. It is obvious,\nhowever,that the resection should be complete and if there is\nany risk that this cannot be achieved by laparoscopic surgery,\nan open approach should be carried out. In patients with\nPPGL, exposure to high levels of circulating catecholamines\nduring surgery could cause hypertensive crises and arrhyth-\nmias. Therefore, all patients with PPGL should receive pre-\noperative preparation at least 10-14 days before surgery [V,\nA].5 Blood pressure targets for the treatment are <130/80\nmmHg in the supine position, and a systolic blood pressure\npreferably >90 mmHg in the upright position. The noncom-\npetitive a-adrenoreceptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, is\ntraditionally the most frequently used adrenergic blocking\nagent. A standard starting dose is 10 mg twice daily with ad-\njustments over the following days. Alternatively, doxazosin, a\ncompetitive and selective a1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, can\nbe similarly effective. If the target blood pressure is not\nreached, calcium antagonists (slow-release nifedipine) or\nmetyrosine may be used. Blockade of b-adrenergic receptors\nis indicated in patients developing tachyarrhythmias but\nshould never be started before blockade of a-receptors.\nGiven the likelihood of rapid intraoperative haemody-\nnamic lability, continuous monitoring of arterial and central\nvenous pressures is essential throughout surgery. Although\ntoday’s volatile anaesthetics are not inductive of hyperten-\nsive crisis, such crises can be induced by other manipulations\nduring surgical procedure (e.g. intubation, insufﬂation of\nperitoneum, direct palpation of the PPGL) or administration\nof certain drugs (e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines).56 Therefore,\nit is strongly recommended that anaesthesia is supervised by\nan experienced anaesthesiologist alert to the diagnosis of a\ncatecholamine-producing tumour. Hypertension during sur-\ngery may be treated with magnesium sulfate, intravenous a-\nadrenoreceptor antagonists (e.g. phentolamine), calcium\nantagonists and/or nitroprusside or nitroglycerine. Tachy-\ncardia can be treated with intravenous b-adrenergic receptor\nblockers (e.g. esmolol). Postoperative hypotension should be\nprevented by saline infusion the day before surgery. If this\nadverse event occurs, it should be treated aggressively. In\ngeneral, sufﬁcient rehydration and treatment of constipation\nare important parts of the preoperative management. Post-\noperative care should also focus on glucose levels because\nhypoglycaemia may occur after reduction of catecholamine\nlevels. Cytoreductive debulking surgery (R2) in malignant\nphaeochromocytoma may improve QoL and survival by\nreducing tumour burden and controlling hormonal hyperse-\ncretion [V, B].3\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

However, several studies have highlighted\nconsiderable heterogeneity in survival. Indeed, prolonged\nsurvival has been reported especially in patients with\nresectable oligometastatic disease, with long intervals be-\ntween recurrences.57,58\nIn general, ﬁrst-line therapy in patients with advanced/\nmetastatic disease is mitotane alone or mitotane plus\nchemotherapy (ChT). Surgery and locoregional therapies\nshould be adopted in addition to systemic therapy in\nselected patient populations (Figure 3). The goal of the\ntherapy is to control tumour growth, hypersecretion-related\nsymptoms and prolong survival.\nA study of the ENSAT network recently identiﬁed the\nprognostic factors in patients with advanced disease.\nAccordingly the stage, as redeﬁned by a modiﬁed ENSAT\n(mENSAT) classiﬁcation,37 which takes into account the\nnumber of tumoural organs, has a major prognostic role\ntogether with the following four parameters grouped under\nthe label GRAS: (i) tumour Grade, (ii) Resection status of the\nprimary tumour, (iii) Age, and (iv) tumour-related or\nhormone-related Symptoms. Based on these results, a risk\nstratiﬁcation was introduced.59 Although this new risk\nclassiﬁcation looks interesting, it needs conﬁrmation in\nother studies before being fully applicable in clinics.\nMitotane\nmonotherapy.\nMitotane\nis\nthe\nonly\ndrug\napproved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in\nlocally\nadvanced\ninoperable\nand\nmetastatic\npatients\n(supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099);\nnevertheless,\nrandomised\ncontrolled prospective trials are lacking.

The combination of EDP and mitotane (EDP-M)\nis recommended in ﬁrst-line settings based on the FIRM-ACT\ntrial results [I, A] (supplementary Table S8, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099 and Figure 3).\nIn the phase III randomised trial including 304 patients,\nprogression-free survival (PFS) was clearly superior in patients\ntreated with EDP-M compared with patients treated with\nstreptozocin plusmitotane[5.0versus2.1months,hazardratio\n(HR) 0.55, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.43-0.69, P < 0.001].60\nHowever, the difference in OS was not signiﬁcant (14.8 versus\n12.0months, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02,P ¼ 0.07), presumably\ndue to the crossover and presence of mitotane in both arms.\nInterestingly, a survival advantage of the EDP-M arm was\nobserved in patients, who could not receive the second-line\ntherapy. In patients unsuitable for EDP-M, mitotane in com-\nbination with etoposide and cisplatin [V, B],61 or mitotane plus\ncisplatin, is an option [V, B].62\nM. Fassnacht et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 11\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099\n1485\n\n---\nIn second-line settings, after failure of EDP-M, the treat-\nment options are limited63 and enrolment of patients into\nclinical trials should be considered ﬁrst. Most patients with\nadvanced ACC remain in good clinical condition but urgently\nseek therapy. In the absence of trials, possible options are the\nassociation of gemcitabine plus capecitabine64,65 or strepto-\nzocin (supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/1\n0.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).60 With both treatments, the\nmedian PFS is short, between 2 and 4 months. Mitotane\ntherapy is sometimes continued in association with second-\nline therapies. However, this must be discussed with the\npatient according to tolerance to the drug and its effect on\nhormonal secretion. The optimal timing to discontinue\nmitotane is debated and could be discussed with the patient\nindividually in cases of progressive disease despite ‘thera-\npeutic’ drug levels or highest tolerated doses assessed at two\ndistinct evaluations.\nSurgery and local therapies. Surgery, including surgery of\nthe primary tumour, may be recommended in all patients\nwith oligometastatic ACC if a complete resection of all\ntumoural lesions is feasible [V, B].4 Additionally, patients\nwith an indolent disease course or under therapeutic\ncontrol might be eligible for surgery. It is also worthwhile\nto consider surgery or other local therapies in all patients\nin whom systemic therapy led to an objective response\nor long-term stable disease [V, B].66,67 A cytoreductive\nresection may also be indicated in rare cases of severe\nsymptomatic hormone excess, after attempts to control\nthe symptoms with a combination of fast-acting anti-\nsecretory agents (i.e. metyrapone) and mitotane68 and\nlocal therapies [V, B]. In these patients, postoperative\nmitotane is clearly advised [V, A]. Local therapies [e.g. RT,\nchemoembolisation,\nradiofrequency\nablation\n(RFA)]\nshould also be discussed in all patients with advanced\noligometastatic ACC [V, B].4\nIn case of a recurrence following ACC surgery, two critical\nquestions must be addressed: (i) What is the time interval\nsince the resection? and (ii) Did recurrence occur during\nongoing mitotane therapy (with effective blood levels)? If the\ndisease-free interval is at least 12 months and another\ncomplete R0 resection/ablation seems feasible, then surgery\nor, alternatively, other local therapies are clearly recom-\nmended [IV, A].69,70 However, if this time interval is <6\nmonths orifcomplete resection/ablation is not feasible,then,\nthe EDP-M provides the treatment of choice, especially if the\nrecurrence occurred during ongoing mitotane treatment at\ntherapeutic levels [IV, A].\nMolecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Several\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been investigated as\nsecond-line approaches in small phase II trials involving\nadvanced ACC (for review, see4,71). Results, however, have\nfailed to show signiﬁcant therapeutic efﬁcacy. In addition,\nthe insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor\nlinsitinib was tested in a multicentre placebo-controlled\nphase III trial (GALACTIC trial) and failed to improve\neither PFS or OS of advanced ACC patients who had already\nreceived systemic antineoplastic therapies.72\nThe results of the ﬁrst (small) trials with immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors in ACC were heterogeneous, with\nmedian PFS times of 1.8, 2.1, 2.6 and 6.75 months,\nrespectively.73-76 However, in one study with 39 patients,\ndisease control rate was 52% and median OS reached\nalmost 25 months, clearly suggesting that a least a subset of\npatients beneﬁts from this therapeutic approach.76\nManagement of hormone excess. In addition to sequelae\nof the malignant disease, patients with overt hyper-\ncortisolism suffer from immunosuppression, diabetes and\nmuscle weakness, which can signiﬁcantly impact QoL.\nSimilarly, severe androgen excess may dramatically impair\nwell-being in women. Therefore, medical therapy to control\nhormonal excess is recommended [V, A]. Mitotane is\nfrequently able to diminish steroid excess, but its efﬁcacy is\noften delayed by several weeks. In these circumstances,\nsteroidogenic enzyme inhibitors, such as metyrapone or\nketoconazole, can be useful [V, B]. Metyrapone is a well-\ntolerated drug and its metabolism and elimination are not\naltered by concomitant mitotane. Therefore, it can be safely\nadministered in association with mitotane and cytotoxic\nChT.68 Local therapies including liver embolisation may also\nbe discussed. All patients with clinically overt hormone\nexcess should be managed by physicians experienced with\nthese endocrine problems.\nPPGLs\nThe therapeutic strategy for metastatic PPGL primarily aims\nto control excessive catecholamine secretion and tumour\nburden, as there are no curative treatment options. Choices\nfor treatment include a watch-and-wait policy (including\nalpha blocker to control hypertension), locoregional thera-\npies,\nradiopharmaceutical\nagents,\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nmolecular-targeted therapies (Figure 4, supplementary\nTable S9, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2020.08.2099). Such choices should be discussed case by\ncase in a multidisciplinary specialised setting. In the absence\nof any published randomised trials and demonstrated\nimpact on survival, QoL for patients should always be\nconsidered in any justiﬁcation for a speciﬁc therapeutic\nintervention. Indeed, due to the indolent course of disease\nin some patients,77 an active surveillance policy may be\nindicated for those who are asymptomatic, have a low-to-\nintermediate tumour burden and absence of localised\ncomplications of any mass. In these patients, treatment-\nrelated adverse events may exceed any beneﬁt of therapy.\nSurgery. Although there is little possibility of a cure for\nmetastatic PPGLs, surgical resection of the primary tumour\nor metastatic lesions should be considered on a case-by-\ncase basis. Debulking surgery can improve symptoms and\npotentially prognosis by reducing secretion of catechol-\namines.78 Other local therapies are available for patients\nwith metastases, such as RT, RFA or chemoembolisation.\nLocal measures are also important to prevent bone-related\nevents.79 However, as with any invasive procedure, local\nablation may induce massive tumoural catecholamine\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Radionuclide therapy is an effective\ntreatment and [131I]MIBG is one of the most frequent ap-\nproaches with radionuclide doses ranging widely from 5.5\nto 38 GBq (150-1000 mCi). Approximately 50% of patients\nare eligible for [131I]MIBG therapy based on uptake from\ndiagnostic scans. Several studies have been published on\nthe efﬁcacy of [131I]MIBG treatment,3 mostly retrospective\nand only two prospective phase II trials.81,82 In both trials,\nobjective responses were observed in 23% of cases ac-\ncording to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours.\nLong-term survival of responders of over 6 years has been\nreported but progression at study entry was not a prereq-\nuisite for most studies. Objective responses were mainly\nobserved in patients with soft tissue metastases. Grade 3-4\ntoxicity was reported in 16%-83% of patients, mainly hae-\nmatological including myelodysplastic syndrome especially\nwith high activity doses.3,82 [131I]MIBG therapy could be\nconsidered as ﬁrst-line approach in patients displaying avid\nuptake of [123I]MIBG in all tumoural lesions who have\nunresectable, progressive PPGL or high tumour burden\n[III, A].\nAn alternative approach is a peptide receptor radioligand\ntherapy using somatostatin analogues labelled with iso-\ntopes delivering a cytotoxic radionuclide. More than 80% of\nPPGLs are detectable by somatostatin-based imaging.83 In\npatients with high uptake of PET tracers, such as gallium-68\n(68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogues (e.g. [68Ga]DOTA-\nTATE or DOTATOC or DOTANOC), treatment with yttrium-\n90-labelled [90Y]DOTATOC or lutetium-177-labelled [177Lu]\nDOTATATE could be similarly effective as MIBG-based\ntherapy, although the number of published studies/case\nseries is limited [V, B].84 Both radionuclide approaches can\nbe applied repeatedly (with a minimum time interval of 3-4\nmonths). However, toxicity frequently becomes a limiting\nfactor over time and beneﬁt should be re-evaluated after\nevery second therapy.\nSystemic ChT. Systemic ChT might be considered as a ﬁrst-\nline treatment in patients with PPGL who have no signiﬁ-\ncant uptake of radiotracers or that are also rapidly pro-\ngressing and associated with high tumour burden or are\nhighly symptomatic [IV, B]. ChT with cyclophosphamide- and\ndacarbazine-based regimens combined with vincristine (CVD)\nand/or doxorubicin (CVDD or CDD) are the most studied\nregimens.85 In the largest published study to date (n ¼ 52\npatients), 40% of patients treated with CVD, CDD or CVDD\nexperienced clinical beneﬁt, including reduction in tumour\nsize in 25% of cases.86 Based on retrospective data, temozo-\nlomide, an oral alternative to dacarbazine, seems to be as\neffective as the previous polyChT regimens.87 These studies\nsuggest that patients with SDHB mutations are especially\nsensitive to temozolomide due to the association with\nhypermethylation of the promoter for O6-methylguanine-\nDNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Furthermore, recent case\nreports provide limited evidence that metronomic temozo-\nlomide is also effective as a second-line therapy.88\nTargeted therapies. There is a rationale and some evidence\non the potential efﬁcacy of antiangiogenic drugs in malig-\nnant\nphaeochromocytomas,\nespecially\nthose\nbearing\nSDHB gene mutations.89 Sunitinib is a potent TKI, including\nvascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 1\nand 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)\nbeta, KIT, FLT3 and RET, and has been the most-studied\ntargeted therapy in PPGL. In addition to several impres-\nsive case reports involving sunitinib, there is one retro-\nspective series with 17 patients with progressive metastatic\nPPGL.90 Of 14 evaluable patients, three had a partial\nresponse (21%) and ﬁve had stable disease (36%). Median\nPFS was 4.1 months and OS 27 months. As hypertension is\na key feature of PPGL and a major adverse event of suni-\ntinib, special attention is required to deal with this issue.\nThere are currently several ongoing trials on sunitinib\nincluding a randomised, placebo-controlled trial testing\nsunitinib in patients with malignant PPGL, now closed for\nrecruitment (FIRST-MAPPP trial, NCT01371201).\nA phase II study with pazopanib involving seven patients\n(study closed because of poor accrual) reported one\nconﬁrmed partial response (17%, duration 2.4 years) and\nmedian PFS and OS of 6.5 and 14.8 months, respectively.91\nRecommendations\nACC\n\u0003 In most patients with metastatic ACC, ﬁrst-line therapy\nwith mitotane alone or mitotane plus ChT is recommen-\nded; EDP-M is the ﬁrst-line treatment of choice [I, A].\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. low tumour burden and/or\nmore\nindolent\ndisease),\nmitotane\nmonotherapy\nis\nreasonable.\n\u0003 Surgery and locoregional therapies should be adopted in\naddition\nto\nsystemic\ntherapy\nin\nselected\npatient\npopulations.\n\u0003 Surgery is the treatment of choice only if all tumoural le-\nsions can be removed [V, B].\n\u0003 Local therapies (e.g. RT, RFA, cryoablation, microwave\nablation, chemoembolisation) are of value for therapy\nin advanced ACC, and an individualised treatment\napproach is required [V, B].\nPPGL\n\u0003 Although there are no curative treatment options, treat-\nment choices include watch-and-wait, locoregional ther-\napies, radiopharmaceutical agents, systemic ChT and\nmolecular-targeted therapies.\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. with low tumour burden\nwithout relevant symptoms), a watch-and-wait policy\n(including alpha blocker to control hypertension) is\npreferred.\n\u0003 In all patients with metastatic PPGL (debulking) surgery\nshould be considered.\nM.

In these guidelines, we follow the recom-\nmendations provided recently by other groups.4,9 For locally\nadvanced or metastatic disease, OS and time-to-progression\nare the most important end points, response rate and\ntreatment toxicity providing secondary end points. Time-to-\nprogression, ORR and treatment toxicity guide clinical\ndecision making in individual patients; they should be\nevaluated at regular intervals during treatment using CT\nscans and/or MRI and laboratory results (supplementary\nFile, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). For patients opting for entirely palliative manage-\nment, no systematic imaging is advised. Information on\nlong-term implications, patient experience, psychological\nimplications and effect of rehabilitation is lacking for ACC\nand PPGL. At least, speciﬁc management of survivors should\nbe based on individual needs and preferences.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines have been produced by\nESMO in partnership with EURACAN, the European Refer-\nence Network for rare adult solid cancers. These Clinical\nPractice Guidelines were developed in accordance with the\nESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical Practice\nGuidelines development (http://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/\nESMO-Guidelines-Methodology). They are conceived to\nprovide the standard approach to diagnosis, treatment and\nsurvivorship on ACC and PPGL. Recommended interventions\nare intended to correspond to the ‘standard’ approaches,\naccording to current consensus among the European\nmultidisciplinary experts in the management of these\nextremely rare diseases. These are represented by the\nmembers of the ESMO Faculty and experts belonging to the\nEndocrine Tumour domain of EURACAN, the ENSAT and the\nEuropean Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions\n(Endo-ERN).\nExperimental interventions considered to be beneﬁcial\nare labelled as ‘investigational’. Other nonstandard ap-\nproaches may be proposed to the single patient as ‘options’\nfor a shared patientephysician decision in conditions of\nuncertainty, as long as some supporting evidence (though\nnot conclusive) is available.

They help health pro-\nfessionals weigh the beneﬁts and the risks of available diagnostic\nor therapeutic options. Randomised clinical trial (RCT) data on\nthe management of thyroid cancer (TC) are relatively scarce, and\nthe quality of available evidence is suboptimal. Retrospective\nanalyses of treatment efﬁcacy frequently show favourable out-\ncomes, but it is difﬁcult to discern the extent to which these\nresults are due to the natural history of the disease. The number\nof cases retrospectively analysed is not an index of the quality of\nthe data or the absence of biases. Consequently, large, well-\nplanned RCTs managed within a network of coordinated centres\nare urgently needed.\nThe main goals of any cancer treatment are to improve overall\nsurvival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Persistent disease in low-\nrisk TC patients is often associated with prolonged survival. The\nindolent behaviour of the tumours in these individuals—the vast\nmajority of the patients seen by clinicians—argues for the use of\nless aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches than those\nreserved for higher-risk patients. Therefore, clinical practice\nguidelines are also intended to provide oncologists with cost-\neffective strategies that will minimise the risks associated with\novertreatment.\nIncidence and epidemiology\nThe last three decades have witnessed steady, worldwide increases\nin the incidence of TC [1, 2]. Figures from the European Network\nof Cancer Registries show estimated incidence rates among\nfemales in 2012 that were approximately threefold higher than\nthose for males (9.3 and 3.1 cases per 100 000 person-years, re-\nspectively) [1]. Rates vary widely from country to country, with\nthe highest ﬁgures (per 100 000 person-years) reported in\nLithuania (15.5), Italy (13.5), Austria (12.4), Croatia (11.4) and\nLuxembourg (11.1). Estimated TC-related mortality rates, by\ncontrast, are low (0.7 and 0.5 cases per 100 000 person-years for\nwomen and men, respectively) with considerably less regional\nand temporal variation [3].\nThe rising incidence rates are almost entirely due to the\nincreased diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) and\npapillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) in particular. Incidence rates for\nfollicular (FTC), anaplastic (ATC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid\ncancers have remained relatively stable over the past 30 years. The\nexpanding use of imaging techniques, biopsy procedures [e.g.\nﬁne-needle aspiration (FNA)] and medical surveillance, along\nwith improved access to healthcare, has facilitated the detection\nof small, subclinical PTCs [4]. The resulting overdiagnosis has in-\nvariably been accompanied by overtreatment [5]. According to\nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force, the risks associ-\nated with TC screening in asymptomatic adults are likely to\nV\nC The Author(s) 2019.

Support is also growing for\nmore conservative, risk-tailored strategies for TC management\n(including watchful waiting) [7–10].\nDTC and poorly differentiated TC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nThe diagnostic work-up of DTCs (including poorly differentiated\nforms) comprises pre- and postoperative pathological and mo-\nlecular assessments. Preoperative FNA for cytology is not\nrequired for nodules measuring \u00021 cm. Decisions to aspirate\nlarger nodules should be guided by lesion size and sonographic\nappearance [8]. Cytology ﬁndings are classiﬁed into diagnostic\ncategories associated with different risks of malignancy [11].\nMost malignant thyroid tumours can be identiﬁed cytologically.\nNotable exceptions are FTCs and the newly deﬁned ‘non-invasive\nfollicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features’\n(NIFTP), which are usually classiﬁed as indeterminate in the vari-\nous thyroid cytology reporting schemes [12]. FNA-based diagno-\nsis of poorly differentiated carcinoma is also challenging unless\nthere is obviously increased mitotic activity and/or necrosis. FNA\ndiagnosis can be facilitated by assessment of malignancy markers\n(including proteins commonly overexpressed in tumours, e.g.\nHBME1 or galectin-3) and molecular alterations speciﬁcally asso-\nciated with malignancy (e.g. BRAF mutations, RET fusions, other\nnovel gene alterations). Speciﬁcally designed gene panels are re-\nportedly useful for identifying malignancy when cytology sam-\nples are morphologically indeterminate [13].\nResected DTCs are histologically classiﬁed according to the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) criteria (updated in 2017—\nTable 1). Based on clinical evidence of their low-grade behaviour\nduring long-term follow-up, encapsulated non-invasive follicular\nPTC variants are now referred to as NIFTPs. They account for up\nto 20% of cases in Europe [14]. Elimination of the term ‘carcin-\noma’ from the deﬁnition of this PTC variant underscores its ex-\ncellent prognosis: NIFTP is associated with no reports of cancer-\nrelated deaths and an estimated risk of recurrence of <1%. This\nnew entity shows partial overlap with the group of tumours\ndeﬁned in Europe as ‘well-differentiated tumours of uncertain\nmalignant potential’ [15]. Diagnosis of NIFTP requires a scrupu-\nlous pathological examination of the follicular-pattern nodule to\nconﬁdently exclude the presence of capsular invasion (even\nmicroscopic) and papillary formations. RAS but not BRAF muta-\ntions characterise NIFTPs. Correct identiﬁcation of NIFTPs\nshould reduce the unnecessary use of radical surgical procedures\nand the needless administration of radioactive iodine (RAI) after\na completion thyroidectomy. NIFTP follow-up strategies should\nmimic those of very-low risk carcinomas (see following sections).\nThere are numerous other PTC variants, including some that are\nparticularly aggressive and associated with higher tumour stages\nand lymph node metastases at diagnosis. The best-known of these\nare the tall cell, columnar, hobnail and solid variants [16, 17].\nThe WHO currently recommends reporting FTCs as ‘minimal-\nly invasive’ when capsular penetration is present without vascular\ninvolvement (a condition associated with an extremely good\nprognosis). The terms ‘angioinvasive’ and ‘widely invasive’\nshould be reserved for follicular cancers with neoplastic emboli\ninvolving <4 or \u00034 blood vessels, respectively.\nThe diagnostic criteria for poorly differentiated carcinomas re-\nmain controversial. A consensus conference in 2006 yielded the\nTurin proposal [18], which restricts this diagnosis to invasive\ntumours with a solid/trabecular/insular growth pattern plus at\nleast one of the following:\n• mitotic index \u00033 per 10 high-power ﬁelds;\n• necrosis;\n• convoluted nuclei (slightly smaller and darker than those typ-\nically seen in PTC, with irregular contours).\nThis deﬁnition delimits a category of TCs that behave aggres-\nsively while maintaining some degree of functional differenti-\nation [e.g. thyroglobulin (Tg) production].\nHu¨rthle cell carcinomas are no longer classiﬁed as ‘follicular\ntumours’, which are generally much less aggressive and less likely\nto present with lymph node metastases [16]. Hu¨rthle cell carcino-\nmas associated with extensive vascular and/or capsular invasion\nshould be managed like other high-risk carcinomas (see following\nsections). ‘Pure’ Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas (i.e., those with a\nHu¨rthle-cell component exceeding 75%) also present molecular\nabnormalities that distinguish them from conventional follicular\ncarcinomas. As for oncocytic PTCs and oncocytic variants of\npoorly differentiated carcinomas, they are no more aggressive\nthan their conventional counterparts.\nMolecular proﬁling has distinguished two major classes of PTCs\ncharacterised by BRAF-predominant and RAS-predominant mo-\nlecular signatures (Table 1) [19]. BRAF V600E mutations are fre-\nquently reported in a subgroup of PTCs with more aggressive\nclinicopathological behaviours, but the need for routine BRAF gen-\notyping of PTCs has not been established. The fatal forms of non-\nATC are generally PTC variants harbouring BRAF or RAS\nmutations plus other genomic alterations (e.g. mutations involving\nthe TERT promoter, TP53, POLE, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway\neffectors, SWI/SNF subunits and/or histone methyltransferases),\nsome of which are potential therapeutic targets [20]. The molecular\nproﬁles of follicular and Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas are less well-\ndeﬁned. Work is underway to deﬁne the genomic and transcrip-\ntomic proﬁles of poorly differentiated and anaplastic TCs [21, 22].\nStaging and risk assessment\nMortality risk. The Union for International Cancer Control\n(UICC) tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation of malig-\nnant tumours stages lesions based on their mortality risks. The\neighth edition [23] introduced important changes for thyroid\ntumours, including the downstaging of extrathyroidal extension\nthat is not macroscopically evident (pT3b) (Table 2). Primaries\nwith extrathyroidal spread that is exclusively microscopic are\nnow staged solely on the basis of tumour size as pT1, pT2 or\npT3a. TNM staging requires a complete review of prognostically\nrelevant morphological and immune-phenotypic parameters\n[20]. A checklist containing these parameters can be included in\nthe ﬁnal pathology report [IV, A] to supply details on the extent\nof invasion (capsular versus vascular, including number of\naffected vessels), tumour size and architecture, presence of necro-\nsis, proliferative activity, etc. [10].\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1857\n\n---\nRisk of persistent or recurrent disease. Table 3 summarises the\nsystem developed in 2015 by the American Thyroid Association\n(ATA) to estimate the risk of persistent or recurrent TC based on\ndata available shortly after treatment of the primary cancer\n[8, 24–26]. These criteria have now been revised and reﬁned\nbased on emerging evidence. The likelihood of persistent/recur-\nrent disease after an apparently complete resection depends on\nseveral factors. The overall estimated risk of recurrence ranges\nfrom <1% to 55% and is classiﬁed as low (\u00025%), intermediate\n(6%–20%) or high (>20%). A high-quality pathology report is\ncrucial for proper risk stratiﬁcation.\nThe initial risk class assignment is revised during follow-up to\nreﬂect the evolution of the disease and responses to treatments\n(dynamic\nrisk\nstratiﬁcation)\n[IV,\nA]\n[27–30].\nTreatment\nresponses are deﬁned as excellent, biochemical incomplete, struc-\ntural incomplete or indeterminate based on imaging ﬁndings >\n[mainly neck ultrasound (US)] and serum Tg and anti-Tg anti-\nbody (TgAb) levels (see Table 4) [8].\nPrimary tumour management\nSurgery. Primary tumour management will be determined by the\nresults of the preoperative risk assessment (Figure 1). Active US\nsurveillance of the thyroid and neck lymph nodes (every 6–\n12 months) can be proposed for unifocal papillary microcarcino-\nmas (\u000210 mm) with no evidence of extracapsular extension or\nlymph node metastases [III, B] [31]. In these cases, the only\nknown predictor of signiﬁcant tumour growth (\u00033 mm) or the\nonset of lymph node metastasis is age (10-year estimated risks:\n36% in patients <30 years old, 14% in those aged 30–50, 6% in\npatients 50–60 years old) [32].\nFor other TCs, total thyroidectomy is still considered the stand-\nard surgical treatment. Two large database studies on surgical man-\nagement strategies found that, for selected low-risk tumours (T1a–\nT1b–T2, N0), lobectomy alone does not reduce OS [IV, B] [33,\n34], but it may be associated with a slightly higher local recurrence\n[8]. However, even large database studies are subject to biases. In\nrisk-beneﬁt analyses, it is important to recall that total thyroidec-\ntomy can cause recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.5%, bilateral in\nrare cases) and temporary or permanent hypoparathyroidism\n(8.1%) [35]. The risk (even when done by high-volume surgeons)\nis almost twice that of lobectomy alone, and postoperative compli-\ncations are generally more likely with low-volume surgeons [36].\nThe use of prophylactic central neck dissection for low-risk\ntumours (T1b–T2, N0) varies from centre to centre [IV, C]\n[37–39]. Evidence of its effect on recurrence-free survival is con-\nﬂicting, and there is no high-level evidence for or against its use-\nfulness for low-risk tumours. Studies supporting prophylactic\nneck dissection for low-risk tumours have shown moderate\nreductions in central neck recurrence (5%–10%) but no im-\nprovement in OS. Prophylactic neck dissection does allow more\ncomplete staging of neck nodes, including identiﬁcation of\nmicrometastases not visible on preoperative US, and this infor-\nmation can be used to reﬁne the prognosis and guide subsequent\ntreatment and follow-up. Risks, however, include temporary\nhypoparathyroidism and overdiagnosis and overtreatment of\nsubclinical micrometastases. The potential beneﬁts of prophylac-\ntic neck dissection for low-risk tumours are now being evaluated\nin an RCT (NCT03570021—ESTIMABL3). For more invasive\ntumours (T3–T4), prophylactic neck dissection may improve re-\ngional control [IV, C] [40].\nRAI therapy. RAI is administered after total thyroidectomy for\nseveral reasons:\n• to eliminate the normal thyroid remnant, thereby ensuring\nundetectable serum Tg levels (in the absence of neoplastic tis-\nsue), which facilitate follow-up (remnant ablation);\n• to irradiate presumed foci of neoplastic cells, thereby reduc-\ning the recurrence risk (adjuvant therapy); and/or\nTable 1.

Some authors consider it a more aggressive form of DTC. When associated with extensive vascular and/or capsular invasion,\nthe recurrence risk should be classiﬁed as high. For minimally invasive Hu¨rthle cell carcinoma, robust data are lacking on the true risk of recurrence.\nfThe BRAF V600E mutation is associated with aggressive histologic features, lymph node metastases and ETE, but its relative contribution to the risk of recur-\nrence is not well-deﬁned. Co-existing BRAF V600E and TERT mutations act synergically to increase the risk of recurrence [25, 26].\n131I, iodine-131; ATA, American Thyroid Association; DTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; ERR, estimated risk of recurrence; ETE, extrathyroidal extension; FTC,\nfollicular thyroid cancer; NIFTP, non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features; PTC, papillary thyroid cancer; RAI, radioactive\niodine; Tg, thyroglobulin; WHO, World Health Organization.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1860 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\n• to treat persistent or recurrent disease (treatment of known\ndisease) [8].\nIn all three cases, RAI administration must be followed by an\niodine-131 (131I) whole-body scan (WBS) to stage the disease\nand document the 131I avidity of any structural lesion. The esti-\nmated level of risk for persistent/recurrent disease will deter-\nmine whether and how much RAI is given. Low activities are\nusually given for remnant ablation (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq); high\nactivities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) are used for treatment pur-\nposes. To optimise isotope uptake, RAI should be given after\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation, which can be\nachieved by withdrawing levothyroxine for 4–5 weeks, ideally\nuntil serum TSH levels reach \u000330 mIU/ml. Alternatively, re-\ncombinant human TSH (rhTSH) can be given (two daily injec-\ntions of 0.9 mg of rhTSH followed by RAI on day 3). The\nresulting TSH level is not usually measured (unless doubts arise\nas to whether the injections have been properly administered).\nLevothyroxine withdrawal is preferred if distant metastases are\npresent. The use of rhTSH is associated with superior short-\nterm QoL [41].\nAs shown in Figure 2, practice guidelines unanimously recom-\nmend treatment with high RAI activities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq)\nfor patients with high risk of recurrence [IV, A] [7–10, 42]. RAI\nadministration is not recommended for certain low-risk patients\n[i.e. those with a small (\u00021 cm) intrathyroidal DTC and no evi-\ndence of locoregional metastases] [II, E] [43]. The term ‘very\nlow-risk’ is often applied to these patients in the literature [7, 44].\nThere is less consensus regarding other low-risk DTC patients\n[IV, C] (see Table 3). In 2015, the ATA guidelines advised against\nthe systematic use of RAI in the latter group [8]. However, the\nEuropean Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) has not\nendorsed this recommendation [45], mainly because prospective\nRCT data showing that surveillance is non-inferior to RAI ad-\nministration are lacking. The ATA, the EANM, the Society of\nNuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) and the\nEuropean Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published a\njoint statement acknowledging the absence of high-quality evi-\ndence either for or against the postoperative use of 131I in low-\nrisk patients [46]. They conclude that decisions should be taken\non an individual basis, depending on tumour features (e.g. risk of\nrecurrence) (see Table 3), patient-related factors (e.g. comorbid-\nities, motivation, emotional concerns), health-care setting (e.g.\navailability and quality of thyroid surgeons, US, RAI imaging, Tg\nassays) and the local management team’s preferences. Lastly, the\nexpected beneﬁts of a given RAI dose should outweigh the risks\nassociated with its administration, which include adverse events\n(AEs) and diminished QoL [43]. The usefulness of 131I therapy in\nlow-risk TC patients is now being assessed in two large RCTs\n(NCT01837745—ESTIMABL2,\nNCT01398085—IoN).\nTwo\nother RCTs (ESTIMABL1 and HiLo) conducted in low-risk DTC\npopulations showed that, if RAI is given in these cases, low activ-\nities (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq) following rhTSH and high activities\n(100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) following levothyroxine withdrawal are\nequally likely to produce successful ablation [I, A] [47, 48]. This\nequivalence is also evident at the level of recurrence-free survival,\nTable 4.

RAI adjuvant therapy can\nbe considered for intermediate-risk patients. Decisions on RAI\ndosage and TSH stimulation modalities are based on case\nfeatures—surgical, clinical and pathological (particularly the ex-\ntent of lymph node involvement and the aggressiveness of the\npathological subtype) [IV, B] [43]. If given, low to high activities\n(30 mCi, 1.1 GBq to 100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) are recommended. In\nthese patients, the ATA recommends individualised decision\nmaking [8].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up tools and schedules (Figure 3) vary according to the\ntumour histotype, initial treatment, initial risk of persistent/re-\ncurrent disease (Table 3) and responses to treatment (Table 4).\nSerum Tg assays and neck US are the mainstays of DTC follow-\nup [51]. Patient management can be improved when health pro-\nfessionals collaborate as members of a multidisciplinary team.\nSerum Tg. Serum Tg is a sensitive marker for the presence of thy-\nrocytes, but it cannot discriminate between normal and\nmalignant cells. Undetectable levels thus have high negative pre-\ndictive values, but detectable values can be false-positives. To\nminimise variability, Tg levels should ideally be measured with\nthe same assay [52]. Concomitant assessment of serum TgAb is\nmandatory, as these antibodies can interfere with Tg assays, caus-\ning false-negative or, less commonly, false-positive results [53].\nSerum Tg can be assayed under basal conditions (i.e. during levo-\nthyroxine treatment) or after endogenous (levothyroxine with-\ndrawal) or exogenous (rhTSH injection) TSH stimulation. In\npatients treated with total thyroidectomy plus RAI remnant abla-\ntion, stimulated serum Tg levels <1 ng/ml are highly predictive of\nan excellent response to therapy, and subsequent stimulated Tg\nassays are unnecessary [54]. High-sensitivity (<0.2 ng/ml) assays\nof basal Tg levels can also be used to verify the absence of disease\n(excellent response) [II, B] [55]. If negative imaging ﬁndings are\naccompanied by detectable Tg levels, the treatment response is\nclassiﬁed as indeterminate or biochemical incomplete (Table 4).\nIn this case, the positive predictive value increases with the serum\nTg level or, if serial measurements are available, with levels that\nincrease over time. Almost 60% of patients who have total thyroi-\ndectomy without postoperative RAI administration will have\nbasal serum Tg levels \u00020.2 ng/ml [56, 57], which indicates an\nDTC \nafter TT ± neck dissection\nTherapeutic\nResidual disease (incomplete surgery, M1)\nRAI-refractory diseasea\n1.

When\nserum Tg levels are detectable, serial measurements of Tg should\nbe obtained on levothyroxine treatment [IV, B] [56, 57]. A simi-\nlar approach might be used following lobectomy [IV, C] [28].\nIncreasing Tg levels are highly suspicious for persistent/recurrent\nDTC, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nNeck US. Neck US is the most effective tool for detecting struc-\ntural disease in the neck, particularly when remnants of normal\nthyroid tissue are present. Combined with the results of FNA cy-\ntology [58] and serum Tg assays, neck US ﬁndings can achieve an\naccuracy of nearly 100% [59]. The shortcomings of US include\nsubstantial operator dependency [60], a high frequency of non-\nspeciﬁc ﬁndings [61] and the possibility of unsatisfactory visual-\nisation of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by\nbone or air. The latter sites are better explored with cross-\nsectional imaging modalities (see below). Abnormal US ﬁndings\ncan be classiﬁed as indeterminate or truly suspicious (Table 5)\n[62, 63]. Unlike PTC, FTC metastasis is typically haematogenous\nand rarely involves the locoregional lymph nodes, so neck US in\nthese cases serves mainly to exclude residual/recurrent thyroid-\nbed disease.\nOther imaging studies.

Rising Tg is highly suspicious for persist-\nent/recurrent disease, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nbHighly sensitive (<0.2 ng/ml) assays of basal Tg can be used in lieu of TSH-stimulated Tg to verify the absence of disease.\ncIn patients with serum TSH level of 0.5–2 mIU/ml after lobectomy, levothyroxine replacement therapy is not mandatory.\ndIn patients with excellent response to therapy, repeat neck US may be avoided.\neShort serum Tg doubling time (<1 year) is associated with poor outcome in DTC patients [72] and should prompt imaging staging.\nfShort tumour growth doubling time (<1 year) may guide the choice of starting a treatment [95].\ngIf FDG is normal, WBS can be carried out after the administration of a therapeutic activity.\nDTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; FDG, ﬂuorodeoxyglucose; FDG–PET, [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomography;\nON-LT4-Tg, thyroglobulin measurement on levothyroxine; q x months, every x months; RAI, radioactive iodine; rhTSH, recombinant human\nthyroid stimulating hormone; RRA, radioiodine remnant ablation; RxWBS, therapeutic whole-body iodine-131 scan; Tg, thyroglobulin; TgAb,\nserum thyroglobulin antibody; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total thyroidectomy; US, ultrasound; WBS, whole-body scan.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1864 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nTgAb levels in the absence of sonographically identiﬁable neck\ndisease or in patients with intermediate-to-high risks of persist-\nent/recurrent disease, irrespective of the neck US ﬁndings)\n[IV, B] [8].\nA WBS can be carried out after the administration of diagnostic\nor therapeutic doses of RAI. Because its sensitivity is low (27%–\n55%), diagnostic WBS is not indicated during follow-up [IV, A]\n[64]. Uptake is highly speciﬁc (91%–100%) for the presence of\nthyroid tissue, but false-positive results are possible. In these cases,\nsingle-photon emission computed tomography or computed\ntomography (CT) offers better anatomic resolution [64].\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomog-\nraphy (FDG–PET) combined with CT is useful for assessing the\nextent of disease and deﬁning the prognosis [65, 66]. Its sensitiv-\nity is around 94%, and speciﬁcity is between 80% and 84%.\nFDG–PET is more sensitive than therapeutic WBS for detecting\npersistent disease in patients with negative cross-sectional imag-\ning studies, serum Tg levels >10 ng/dl, and/or aggressive histo-\ntypes (e.g. aggressive PTC, poorly differentiated TC, widely\ninvasive follicular carcinoma) [67]. FDG uptake is associated\nwith a worse prognosis and refractoriness to RAI treatment [68,\n69], but it is not a reliable predictor of tumour growth [70].\nFDG–PET is the ﬁrst-line isotopic imaging technique for patients\nwith RAI-refractory disease.\nCross-sectional imaging modalities should be chosen on\nthe basis of the anatomic region to be explored. CT is best for\nneck and chest imaging. Contrast enhancement is used for\nstudies of the neck and mediastinal lymph nodes but not\nfor the lungs. All forms of RAI treatment should be deferred\nfor at least 6 weeks after administration of any iodinated con-\ntrast medium. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imag-\ning (MRI) is appropriate for exploring the neck, liver,\nbones and brain [64]. MRI of the neck is subject to\nsubstantial image degradation due to respiratory motion,\nand a CT scan is often a better alternative. Suspected\naerodigestive-tract involvement should always be assessed\nendoscopically.\nFollow-up strategies. All patients with DTC should have neck US\nand serum Tg and TgAb assays 6–18 months after primary\ntreatment (surgery 6 RAI therapy). The subsequent follow-up\nschedule will depend on the initially estimated risk of persistent/\nrecurrent disease and responses to therapy (Figure 3).\nPTC patients at low risk for recurrence who have no evidence\nof structural disease at the ﬁrst follow-up visit can be monitored\nwith periodic (12–24 months) Tg and TgAb assessments. Repeat\nneck US scans can be carried out as needed, depending on serum\nTg and TgAb levels [71]. The same schedule can be adopted for\nintermediate-risk PTC patients with excellent responses to treat-\nment [IV, A] [27, 30, 44]. TSH levels should be maintained in the\nlow-normal range (0.5–2 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. The follow-up\nprotocol for minimally invasive FTCs is often the same one used\nfor low-risk PTCs, although the evidence supporting such an ap-\nproach is insufﬁcient [V, C] [24].\nLow- or intermediate-risk PTC patients with a biochemical in-\ncomplete or indeterminate response to treatment should have\nserum Tg and TgAb assays and a neck US every 6–12 months.\nRising Tg or TgAb levels warrant further imaging studies [72].\nMild TSH suppression should be considered (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) in\npatients at intermediate risk of recurrence [IV, B] [8].\nIn patients with high-risk PTCs, poorly differentiated TCs or\nwidely invasive FTCs, serum Tg and TgAb levels should be\nassessed every 6–12 months if the response to therapy is excellent\nor biochemical indeterminate/incomplete. Cross-sectional or\nfunctional imaging studies should be repeated if detectable Tg\nlevels persist [IV, B] [27, 30]. For patients whose recurrence risk\nis initially classiﬁed as high, a more in-depth imaging work-up\nmay be advisable even if serum Tg levels remain or become un-\ndetectable, as the absence of the circulating Tg may simply reﬂect\nthe dedifferentiation of any residual tumour tissue that might be\npresent [8]. Serum TSH levels should be suppressed in all patients\nwith biochemical incomplete or indeterminate responses to treat-\nment (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. Patients with structural in-\ncomplete responses can be placed on active surveillance or\nreferred for local or systemic treatments.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nDistant metastases occur in fewer than 10% of patients with\nDTC. Half are present when the tumour is ﬁrst discovered; the\nothers are found later, sometimes decades after initial treatment.\nMetastases are observed most frequently in patients with aggres-\nsive histological subtypes (e.g. tall-cell, hobnail, solid, diffuse\nsclerosing and columnar-cell variants): vascular invasion, large\nprimary tumours, macroscopic extrathyroidal extension, bulky\nlocoregional nodal disease [8]. The most common sites are lungs\nand bones (involved in 49% and 25% of all cases, respectively),\nand in 15% of cases, both are affected [73]. Bone metastases are\nmore common in FTC than in PTC (55.5% versus 31.5%, re-\nspectively). Spinal (34.6%) and pelvic (25.5%) bones are the\nmost frequently involved, followed by those of the chest (18.3%),\nextremities\n(10.2%),\nshoulder\ngirdle\n(5.4%)\nand\nthe\nTable 5.

Brain, liver and skin in-\nvolvement is less common. The overall mortality rates 5 and\n10 years after diagnosis of distant metastases are 65% and 75%,\nrespectively [75].\nDistant metastases are usually diagnosed because of clinical\nsymptoms or suspicious imaging/laboratory ﬁndings (abnormal\nuptake on a post-ablation WBS, or a positive ﬁnding on an FDG–\nPET-CT scan or a cross-sectional study prompted by elevated Tg\nlevels in patients whose post-ablation WBS is negative).\nRAI therapy. Patients with distant metastases should receive 100–\n200 mCi (3.7–7.4 GBq) of 131I after TSH stimulation [IV, A] [73].\nThe latter can be achieved with levothyroxine withdrawal or, if\nwithdrawal is clinically contraindicated or the patients has hypo-\npituitarism, with injections of rhTSH (Figure 2). One-third of\npatients have lesions that are not RAI-avid and are considered\nRAI-refractory [IV, A] (Figure 2) [73, 76]. If the distant metasta-\nses are RAI-avid, 131I is administered every 6 months for 2 years\nand less frequently thereafter. Between treatments, suppressive\ndoses of levothyroxine are given to maintain serum TSH levels\nbelow 0.1 mIU/ml (unless there are speciﬁc contraindications)\n[III, B] [77–79]. Data from some prospective cohort studies sug-\ngest that disease progression, recurrence and death rates are\nreduced in patients undergoing TSH suppression for structurally\nidentiﬁable disease [77, 79], but it is still unclear how much sup-\npression is appropriate [78]. Between treatments, efﬁcacy should\nbe veriﬁed with periodic cross-sectional imaging studies.\nCompared with repeated administrations of standard doses of\nRAI (100 mCi or 3.7 GBq), use of higher, dosimetrically deter-\nmined activities appears to offer no beneﬁts in terms of OS [80].\nWhen distant metastases lose their ability to concentrate RAI or\nstructural progression occurs within 6–12 months after RAI ad-\nministration, the disease is considered RAI-refractory [IV, A]\n(Figure 2) [73, 76]. A cure is unlikely if lesions persist after ad-\nministration of a cumulative dose of 600 mCi 131I, and decisions\non whether to continue RAI therapy will be based on tumour\nburden, RAI-uptake intensity and responses to previous RAI\nadministrations [73].\nOverall, one out of three patients with distant metastases will\nbe cured with RAI and have a near-normal life expectancy [73].\nThese are usually young individuals with well-differentiated TC\nand small non-FDG-avid metastatic lesions. The other patients\nwill at some point be classiﬁed as RAI-refractory; the prognosis in\nthese cases will vary, depending mainly on the tumour burden\nand growth rate. Overall, their 5-year survival is <50%. RAI re-\nfractoriness, however, remains uncommon, with an estimated in-\ncidence of 4–5 cases per million population. Drugs for re-\ninducing or increasing RAI uptake by the tumours are currently\nunder investigation. The selective kinase inhibitors dabrafenib\n[81], vemurafenib [82] and selumetinib [83] can reportedly re-\nstore RAI uptake and tumour responses in selected patients, espe-\ncially in those with small tumour burden and low progression\nrate. Several trials are underway to validate these preliminary data\n(NCT03244956, NCT02456701, NCT02145143, NCT02152995,\nNCT03363347), but thus far, none of the three drugs has been\napproved for this indication.\nLocoregional therapy. Several locoregional approaches can be\nused to treat TC. The data and indications discussed below,\nhowever, are based mainly on studies of other solid tumours.\nSpeciﬁc recommendations are lacking for DTC or MTC patients;\ntherefore, the indications for locoregional treatments of these\ntumours will be discussed together. ATC patients will be dis-\ncussed separately, as their poor prognosis is a major factor in all\ntreatment decisions.\nBone metastases: The relatively long survival perspective places\nTC patients with bone metastases at high risk of skeletal-related\nevents (SREs), i.e. pathological fractures, spinal cord compres-\nsion, need for radiation (for pain or impending fracture) or sur-\ngery and hypercalcaemia. Up to 37% of TC patients experience\nSREs, and they are associated with poorer prognoses [84, 85].\nThere is a strong rationale and some clinical data supporting\nthe roles for bone resorption inhibitors (bisphosphonates or\ndenosumab) [V, B], external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or other\nlocoregional treatments in reducing SREs [86]. Bisphosphonates\nand denosumab have each been shown to decrease SRE rates and\nbone pain associated with breast, prostate and lung cancers.\nInhibition of bone resorption should be considered in TC\npatients with multiple bone metastases. Treatment can be admin-\nistered every 4 weeks (bisphosphonates and denosumab) or every\n3 months (bisphosphonates). The optimal duration of treatment\nis unknown, but in other more thoroughly studied tumours (e.g.\nbreast, prostate, lung), a minimum of 2 years is recommended.\nAdequate calcium and vitamin D levels should be maintained\nduring treatment. The most signiﬁcant AE of these drugs is jaw\nosteonecrosis, and the risk is increased in patients receiving\nantiangiogenic therapy [87]. A baseline dental evaluation is\nthus mandatory before starting treatment with bone resorption\ninhibitors, and regular checkups are recommended during\ntreatment.\nIf the bone metastases are RAI-avid, RAI therapy may control\nthe disease for some time and alleviate or delay symptoms, but it\nis unlikely to eliminate these lesions. Locoregional treatments\nmay allow longer progression-free intervals and even cures in\npatients with targetable, oligometastatic bone disease. Surgery\nfollowed by EBRT is associated with the best outcomes, at least\nfor limb lesions [88]. If surgery is not feasible, bone lesions associ-\nated with pain or a high fracture risk should be treated with frac-\ntionated (20 Gy in ﬁve fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions) or\nsingle-fraction (8 Gy) EBRT and/or with interventional radiology\ntechniques, including cementoplasty and thermal ablation [89].\nFor spinal cord compression in a patient whose life expectancy\nexceeds 6 months, longer fractionation schedules (e.g. 30 Gy in 10\nfractions over 2 weeks) are recommended. If the life expectancy is\n\u00026 months, a single fraction of 8 or 20 Gy in ﬁve fractions should\nbe used to minimise hospitalisation [II, B] [90].\nPercutaneous vertebroplasty can reduce the pain and deform-\nity associated with vertebral body fractures. The efﬁcacy of this\ninnovative approach has not been directly compared with surgery\nand should only be done in high-volume centres to minimise the\nrisk of complications (e.g. cement leakage outside the bone).\nThere is limited evidence that other conservative techniques\n[radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryotherapy] are effective for\ntreating TC-related bone lesions [V, B] [91].\nPalliative EBRT alleviates pain and neurological complications.\nPain relief is often achieved 48–72 h after treatment, although it\nmay take up to 1 month.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1866 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nLung metastases: The lung is a common site of TC metastasis.\nThe lesions are usually multiple, bilateral, of varying size (from a\nfew millimetres to 1 cm) and asymptomatic. Metastasectomy is\nnot the standard approach for these lesions, but it may be consid-\nered for oligometastasis in patients with good performance status\n(PS) [V, C]. RFA is also a possibility for solitary lesions or those\ncausing a speciﬁc symptom due to their volume and location [V,\nC]. RFA is considered for lesions <2–3 cm in patients not eligible\nfor surgery or those requiring an extensive resection [92].\nLiver metastases: Liver metastases are rare in DTC but more\ncommon in MTC. Liver involvement usually presents with mul-\ntiple lesions, but if true solitary lesions are detected, they may be\ncandidates for local ablation. In MTC patients with a dominant\nlesion that is growing more rapidly than the background dis-\nease, local ablation (e.g. RFA) may be useful for controlling\nsymptoms, systemic ones in particular, such as diarrhoea. The\noutcome of RFA will depend on the size of the lesion (optimally\n<30 mm), its location (at least 3 mm from all vessels) and its\nvisibility on US. Direct comparisons of surgery and RFA are\nlacking. In general, individuals who are ineligible for surgery are\nnot the best candidates for percutaneous ablation. If both sur-\ngery and RFA are contraindicated, hepatic intra-arterial embol-\nisation with drug-eluting beads might be an option: it has been\nused in other solid tumours [93] but its efﬁcacy in TC has not\nbeen validated.\nInvasion of upper aerodigestive tract: Invasion of the upper\naerodigestive tract should always be excluded in TC patients with\nlocoregional disease. Suspicious symptoms include haemoptysis\nand dysphagia. Contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI are helpful\nfor exploring suspicious cases, although endoscopy is more de-\nﬁnitive. In selected cases (e.g. bleeding, exophytic lesions), local\ntreatment (e.g. laser excision) is advisable before starting antian-\ngiogenic multikinase inhibitor (MKI) therapy.\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. TSH suppression\n(serum level <0.1 lIU/ml) is recommended for all TC patients\nwith persistent structural disease in the absence of speciﬁc contra-\nindications [III, B] [77].

Temporal trends in the levels of\nserum tumour markers (e.g. Tg doubling time) can be used to\nsupport and help decision making [95]. Importantly, however,\nan increase in serum Tg levels in the absence of radiologically evi-\ndent disease progression should not be used to select patients\nrequiring systemic therapy. A complete cross-sectional imaging\nassessment of the extent of the disease is mandatory for any treat-\nment decisions. RECIST v1.1 are used to deﬁne target lesions and\nmeasure responses to systemic treatment [94]. The imaging as-\nsessment should be repeated every 3–12 weeks during treatment.\nReductions in serum Tg are expected in responders, but clinical\ndecisions cannot be based on this parameter alone.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Lenvatinib and sorafenib should be\nconsidered the standard ﬁrst-line systemic therapy for RAI-\nrefractory DTC [I, A; ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 scores: 3 for lenvatinib, 2 for sorafenib].\nLenvatinib and sorafenib have been approved by the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) and the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration\n(FDA)\nfor\nprogressive,\nmetastatic,\nRAI-\nrefractory DTC. Both drugs have been investigated in two large,\nrandomised phase III trials (sorafenib in DECISION [96], lenva-\ntinib in SELECT [97]). Head-to-head comparisons of the two\nagents have not been undertaken. They cannot be compared\nbased on their performances in the RCTs cited above, which dif-\nfered substantially in terms of enrolment criteria. Unlike the\nDECISION population, participants in SELECT underwent man-\ndatory assessment of radiological disease progression at entry by\nan independent committee, and pre-treated patients were not\nexcluded. In addition, progression-free survival (PFS) in the pla-\ncebo arm of SELECT was shorter than that of DECISION, which\nalso suggests that the SELECT trial population may have had\nmore advanced or more active disease than that of the\nDECISION study.\nIn the DECISION trial, 417 patients were randomised (1 : 1)\nto treatment with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo,\nwith crossover permitted at disease progression [96]. The study\ndemonstrated that sorafenib signiﬁcantly prolongs PFS [me-\ndian PFS (mPFS) 10.8 versus 5.8 months with placebo, hazard\nratio (HR) 0.59, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.45–0.76,\nP ¼ 0.001]. Objective responses (all partial) occurred in 12% of\nthe sorafenib group and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients\n(P < 0.0001). The median response duration was 10.2 months\n(95% CI 7.4–16.6). Stable disease lasting \u00036 months (post hoc\nanalysis) was observed more frequently with sorafenib (82/196\npatients, 41.8% versus 67/202 patients, 33.2% in the placebo\ngroup). Disease control (partial response or disease stability\nlasting \u00036 months; post hoc analysis) was achieved in 106/196\npatients (54.1%) treated with sorafenib and 33.8% (68/201\npatients) of those receiving placebo (P < 0.0001). Most patients\n(71.4%) receiving placebo crossed over to sorafenib, and 20.3%\nof patients in sorafenib arm and 8.6% of patients in placebo\narm received additional therapies. OS was similar in the two\narms (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54–1.19, P ¼ 0.14), and the median\nOS (mOS) had not been reached at the data cut-off (31 August\n2012). The median durations of treatment were 10.6 months\n(interquartile range 5.3–15.7) with sorafenib and 6.5 months\n(3.3–12.9) with placebo.\nIn the SELECT trial, 392 patients were randomised 2 : 1 to re-\nceive lenvatinib or placebo [97]. The study met the primary aim,\ndemonstrating that lenvatinib signiﬁcantly prolonged PFS com-\npared with placebo, as ﬁrst-line therapy (mPFS 18.3 versus\n3.6 months in the placebo arm, HR 0.21, 99% CI 0.14–0.31,\nP < 0.001) and in pre-treated patients (mPFS 15.1 months). The\n6-month PFS rates were 77.5% (lenvatinib group) and 25.4%\n(placebo group). Responses to lenvatinib (complete in four cases)\nwere observed in 64.8% patients (compared with 1.5% in the pla-\ncebo group) (OR 28.87, 95% CI 12.46–66.86, P < 0.001).\nResponses occurred rapidly (median time to objective response:\n2 months, 95% CI 1.9–3.5).

Previous\nMKI therapy is not a contraindication for subsequent use of\nthese drugs, but data on second-line efﬁcacy are scarce [II, C].\nMKIs should be continued until the disease progresses, un-\nacceptable toxicities occur or the patient asks to stop treatment.\nIn the presence of single-site progression, locoregional treatment\n(e.g. EBRT, embolisation, percutaneous treatment modalities)\ncan be done for local control, without discontinuing MKIs [V,\nC]. Data on real life experiences with lenvatinib in DTC patients\nare now available and as expected, the drug’s efﬁcacy was not as\ngood as that observed in highly selected RCT populations [100,\n101]. Other antiangiogenic agents have been tested as ﬁrst-line\ntherapy in phase II trials, with widely varying response rates\n(Table 6) [102–110]. None of these agents has been approved yet\nfor RAI-resistant DTC. MKIs with speciﬁc targets [e.g. BRAF,\ntropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK)] have also been used.\nVemurafenib has reportedly displayed activity against BRAF\nV600E TCs in both MKI-naive [overall response rate (ORR)\n38.5%, 95% CI 20.2–59.4] and pre-treated patients (ORR 27.3%,\n95% CI 10.7–50.2) [81, 111]. Larotrectinib has been recently\napproved by the FDA and the EMA for all paediatric and adult\ncancers expressing the TRK gene fusion protein. Partial\nresponses were observed in all ﬁve TC patients treated with this\ndrug in a recently reported phase I/II trial [112]. There is a bio-\nlogical rationale for treating advanced TCs with antiangiogenetic\nagents plus immune checkpoint inhibitors [113], and an RCT is\ncurrently underway to assess the activity of lenvatinib plus pem-\nbrolizumab in this setting (NCT02973997).\nAEs of MKIs: AEs occurred in 98.6% of patients receiving sora-\nfenib during the DECISION trial [96]: hand–foot syndrome,\ndiarrhoea, alopaecia, rash or desquamation, fatigue, weight loss\nand hypertension were the most common. Serum TSH levels\nexceeding 0.5 mIU/ml were observed in 33.3% patients (69/207)\nin the sorafenib arm. TSH increases are a recognised AE of sorafe-\nnib and other MKIs, and levels should be checked monthly to en-\nsure that suppression is maintained.\nSerious AEs were documented in 37.2% (77/207) of the\nsorafenib-treated participants. Nine developed a second malig-\nnancy: squamous-cell skin cancer in seven cases (one patient also\nhad melanoma), acute myeloid leukaemia and bladder cancer in\nthe remaining two cases. Skin cancer is a consequence of sorafe-\nnib’s paradoxical activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase\nsignalling in keratinocytes harbouring mutated or activated RAS.\nIn clinical practice, skin cancer can be resected surgically with\ncurative intent and sorafenib continued, but monitoring and\nearly intervention for skin lesions is essential. The high rate of\nAEs inevitably diminishes treatment compliance. In DECISION,\nwhere the mean daily dose was 651 mg, AEs frequently led to\ntreatment interruptions (137/207 patients, 66.2%), dose reduc-\ntions (133 patients, 64.3%) or drug withdrawals (39 patients,\n18.8%).\nIn SELECT, at least one side-effect also occurred in all\nlenvatinib-treated patients [114], the most common being hyper-\ntension, diarrhoea, fatigue, proteinuria, rash and hand–foot syn-\ndrome. Treatment interruptions (82.4% of patients) and dose\nreductions (67.8%) led to a mean daily lenvatinib dose of 17.2 mg\n[97]. AEs generally occurred during the ﬁrst few weeks of treat-\nment and decreased rapidly after treatment is interrupted. A trial\ncomparing lenvatinib starting doses of 24 versus 18 mg is current-\nly recruiting (NCT02657369). More selective agents such as laro-\ntrectinib for TRK fusion-positive cancers and highly selective\nRET inhibitors (e.g. LOXO 292, BLU 667) have better toxicity\nproﬁles. Off-target side-effects are uncommon with these drugs,\nand toxicities are mild and manageable, mostly of grades 1 and 2\n[112, 115].\nPhysicians, patients and caregivers should be aware of these\nAEs. Caught early, they can be effectively managed, but preven-\ntion, when feasible, is always advisable [116]. The aim should be\nto manage the side-effects successfully without resorting to dose\nor treatment schedule adjustments, which can have detrimental\neffects on treatment efﬁcacy. A post hoc analysis of the impact of\ndose interruption on lenvatinib efﬁcacy in SELECT trial partici-\npants revealed that longer interruptions and lower mean dose\nintensities may diminish the potential beneﬁt conferred by the\ndrug [117]. As MKIs may cause fatal harm when administered to\na pregnant woman and may result in reduced fertility in both\nsexes, fertility preservation approaches should be discussed be-\nfore treatment starts [118].\nConventional cytotoxic therapy: The results of chemotherapy\n(ChT) administration (e.g. doxorubicin) in RAI-refractory DTC\nare disappointing; therefore, it is not recommended unless MKI\ntherapy is contraindicated.\nATC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nATCs are very rare tumours that usually present at an advanced\nstage, display extremely aggressive behaviour, and are associated\nwith a very poor prognosis. They are morphologically heteroge-\nneous and must be distinguished from other neck tumours,\nincluding squamous carcinoma of the larynx, sarcomas and lym-\nphomas. Preoperative biopsy assessment includes diagnostic\nimmunomarkers that can differentiate ATC from large cell\nlymphoma or pleomorphic sarcoma. The molecular proﬁle of\nATC includes mutations of the TERT promoter (associated with\nBRAF or RAS mutations) and TP53 [21, 22], as well as targetable\nabnormalities (e.g. NTRK and ALK rearrangements).\nStaging and risk assessment\nIn the eighth edition of the UICC TNM staging system [23], diag-\nnosis of ATC is no longer associated with pT4 stage by default.\nCases treated with resection are staged like other TC histotypes,\nbased on tumour size and extension (Table 2).\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1869\n\n---\nATCs are considered one of the most aggressive solid tumours\nin humans. The median survival after the initial diagnosis is\n\u00054 months and only one out of ﬁve patients survives more than\n12 months (1-year survival rates: 10%–20%). Long-term survival\nhas been reported, but the estimated rate at 10 years is <5%. The\ndismal prognosis stems from the fact that over 40% of the\npatients present at diagnosis with large primary tumours (mean\nsize: 6 cm), gross extrathyroidal extension and locoregional and\ndistant metastases, which make complete resection unlikely\n[119]. A thorough imaging work-up should be carried out soon\nafter the diagnosis. The FDG–PET-CT scan is the most sensitive\ntool for documenting the extent of disease. Scans should be\nrepeated at all stages of treatment [120].\nATC\nConﬁ rm diagnosis with histopathologya [V, A]\nResectable (R0/R1) with minimal morbidityc\nUnresectable/M1 disease\nMutated\nWild-type\nBest supportive \ncare [V, B]\nFully stage urgentlyb with cross-sectional imaging\nFDG–PET-CT useful for M1 disease [IV, A]\nFibreoptic analysis of airway and vocal cord function \n± endoscopic review of oesophageal invasion [IV, A]\nDiscussion in a multidisciplinary tumour board including palliative care [V, A]\nTT ± neck dissection [IV, A] \nIf R0/R1 and M0, \nconsider postoperative EBRT ± ChTd  \nas soon as possible post-surgerye [IV, A] \nDabrafenib + trametinib \n[V, B]\nClinical trials or palliative \nChTg [V, B]\nPalliative EBRT \n[V, B]\nFigure 5.

ATC is rarely amenable to complete resection (Figure 5).\nTotal thyroidectomy with bilateral central neck dissection may be\ncarried out in those very rare cases of localised ATC in M0\npatients. Extensive resection with total laryngectomy, oesopha-\ngectomy and/or resection of the great vessels has been reported in\nhighly selected cases in specialised centres, but postoperative\nmortality and morbidity are high and there is no high-level evi-\ndence to indicate that this approach improves survival. The prog-\nnosis is also unaffected by incomplete palliative resection (R2) or\n‘debulking’, which is not generally recommended [IV, E] [121].\nTracheostomy may be needed to alleviate symptoms in patients\nwith moderately progressive disease, but the impact of tracheos-\ntomy on QoL must be considered. Given the technical complex-\nity, the procedure is generally done under general anaesthesia. An\nexperienced team of surgeons and anaesthesiologists is essential,\nas is a complete preoperative cross-sectional imaging assessment\nof the trachea and tumour.\nRadiotherapy. Optimal outcomes in terms of survival and local\ndisease control in ATC require complete or near-complete [no\nresidual tumour (R0) or microscopic residual tumour (R1)] re-\nsection followed by high-dose EBRT, with or without concomi-\ntant ChT [V, A] [122, 123]. However, this multimodal approach\ncan strongly impact QoL and should be reserved for carefully\nselected patients to ensure clinical beneﬁt. Timely discussion\nwithin a multidisciplinary team setting is strongly recommended\n[V, A] (Figure 5).\nAnalysis of 1200 ATC cases in a large national database [121]\nrevealed signiﬁcantly better outcomes when multimodality\ntherapy included radical surgery (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.28–0.43,\nP < 0.0001 versus no surgery or palliative surgery), 40 Gy of\nEBRT (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38–0.56, P < 0.0001 versus no ERBT\nor <40 Gy EBRT) and ChT of any type (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52–\n0.76, P < 0.0001 versus no ChT). Outcomes also varied with\nUICC stage. For stage IVA disease, the beneﬁt from additional\ntherapies was nonsigniﬁcant. For stage IVB disease, however,\nradical surgery followed by both EBRT and ChT signiﬁcantly\nimproved cause-speciﬁc survival compared with radical sur-\ngery alone or with EBRT (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25–0.81,\nP ¼ 0.0083).\nA meta-analysis of 17 retrospective studies including 1147\npatients looked at the impact of postoperative radiotherapy\n(PORT) after radical ATC resection and found that it signiﬁcant-\nly reduced the risk of death as compared with radical resection\nalone (HR 0.556, 95% CI 0.419–0.737, P < 0.001) [124].\nExploratory analyses demonstrated that PORT might also confer\na survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IVA (HR 0.364,\nP ¼ 0.012) or IVB (HR 0.460, P ¼ 0.059) disease but not for stage\nIVC. For best outcomes, PORT must be delivered as soon as pos-\nsible after surgery [IV, A], but the patient must have recovered\nfrom surgery sufﬁciently to be able to lie ﬂat and tolerate\nimmobilisation.\nBecause of the improved dose distribution and the ability to re-\nduce toxicity, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (RT) is the rec-\nommended approach [IV, C] [125]. There is some evidence of a\ndose–response relation. Outcomes in ATC are improved with\ndoses exceeding 45–50 Gy [126, 127]. An analysis of the United\nStates National Cancer Database showed maximal beneﬁts with\ndoses >60 Gy [128]. Evidence that hyperfractionated accelerated\nRT (i.e. delivery of two or more fractions per day over a shorter\ntreatment time) improved survival over that obtained with con-\nventional fractionation is insufﬁcient, whereas it was clearly asso-\nciated with increased toxicity [129–131].\nFor stage IVA or IVB disease, concomitant ChT (usually with\ndoxorubicin or a platinum agent) has been used. Most of the data\nreported on this approach came from single-institution series\nand the clinical beneﬁts reported have been variable. It has been\nshown that concomitant taxane therapy has radio-sensitising\neffects [132].\nPalliative EBRT: In patients with unresectable disease, EBRT\nhas a role in symptom control [V, C] [133]. The aim is usually to re-\nduce the rate of growth of the neck mass and thereby the pressure\nsymptoms. Fractionation schedules vary according to the individual\npatient (most commonly from 20Gy in ﬁve fractions to 30 Gy in 10\nfractions). These fractionation regimens allow simple beam\narrangements such as parallel opposed or simple three-dimensional\nconformal techniques, so that RT can be started as soon as possible.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. Novel systemic\ntherapies are urgently needed to improve the generally poor out-\ncomes associated with ATC. Clinical trial enrolment should\ntherefore be encouraged for patients with good clinical PS [V, B].\nFor patients ineligible for systemic treatments or clinical trials,\nbest supportive care should be discussed (Figure 5) [133].\nTo date, cytotoxic ChT has been the primary treatment for\nmetastatic disease, but it is associated with very low response rates\nand signiﬁcant toxicities [133]. Recommended regimens consist\nof single-agent therapy with paclitaxel or doxorubicin or com-\nbined treatments (e.g. carboplatin/paclitaxel, docetaxel/doxo-\nrubicin) administered weekly or every 3–4 weeks [134–136]. No\ndata are available to guide decisions on second-line therapy\n[133]. Chemoradiotherapy can be considered for local control of\nunresectable stage IVB disease, ideally with weekly administra-\ntion of radio-sensitising ChT (see above).\nSeveral novel approaches (targeted therapy, immunother-\napy) are being studied, alone or in combination, to improve\nthe poor response rates achieved with current strategies. The ef-\nﬁcacy of lenvatinib in ATC is controversial. In 2015, the\ndrug was approved by the Japanese regulatory agency for treat-\nment of TCs, including ATC, based on data from a single-arm,\nopen-label, phase II study conducted on a population of 51\npatients [137], 17 of whom had ATC. The primary aim was to\nestablish the drug’s safety in this setting. The ATC patients had\nan mPFS of 7.4 months (95% CI 1.7–12.9), an mOS of\n10.6 months (95% CI 3.8–19.8) and an objective response rate\nof 24%. These ﬁndings prompted an international, multi-\ncentre, phase II trial, but the trial was stopped early due to futil-\nity (NCT02657369).\nMolecular proﬁling studies have begun to elucidate the mo-\nlecular drivers and the multistep dedifferentiation associated\nwith ATC tumourigenesis [21, 22]. Early mutation of BRAF and\nRAS has been reported in 25% and 28% of the cases, respectively\n[138]. In a phase II, open-label basket trial, patients with BRAF\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1871\n\n---\nV600E-positive malignancies (including 16 with ATC) were\ntreated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily)\nplus the MEK inhibitor trametinib (2 mg once daily). The ORR\nwas 69% (11/16; 95% CI 41%–89%), and the treatment was well\ntolerated [139]. In May 2018, this combination received FDA\napproval for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic\nATC with the BRAF V600E mutation. If available, this should be\nthe ﬁrst-line therapy for advanced BRAF V600E ATC patients\n[V, B]. Other rare mutations and genetic aberrations may also\nprove to be druggable, such as ALK translocations [21, 22].\nExtended molecular proﬁling of ATCs should be strongly\nencouraged as it may reveal promising possibilities for targeted\ntherapies.\nIn the presence of non-druggable mutations, targeting the tu-\nmour microenvironment or common cancer signalling pathways\nis an alternative approach. ATC immunoproﬁling has revealed\nhigh numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes in the tumour\nand tumour cell expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-\nL1) [138]. Immunotherapy with antibodies targeting pro-\ngrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor or PD-L1 has produced\nimpressive results in many malignancies, but few data are avail-\nable on their use in ATC. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody\nspartalizumab was tested in 41 heavily pre-treated patients with\nadvanced ATC, and responses were observed in 19.5%, opening\nthe road to the use of immunotherapy in ATC [140].\nInclusion of targeted therapy, immunotherapy, ChT and/or\nRT,\nadministered\nin\ncombination\nor\nsequentially,\nin\nmultidisciplinary ATC management regimens may improve pa-\ntient outcomes (NCT03181100).\nMTC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nMTC is morphologically heterogeneous and can mimic virtually\nall other primary thyroid tumours. Demonstration of calcitonin\n(Ctn) expression is mandatory for the diagnosis. Rare primary\nCtn-negative neuroendocrine carcinomas of the thyroid exist\nand must be distinguished from metastases from neuroendo-\ncrine neoplasms of the lung. In these cases, carcinoembryonic\nantigen (CEA) determination can be useful, being the only neck\ntumour expressing this marker. The preoperative diagnosis\ncan also be challenging in the absence of a consistent\nimmunophenotype.\nRET and RAS proto-oncogene mutations are detected in\n\u000590% of MTCs and are considered the predominant drivers of\nthese tumours [141]. RET mutations occur sporadically, as som-\natic events, or can be inherited as germline events associated with\nfamilial MTC or the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes\ntype 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B). A quarter of MTCs occur\nas part of an inherited syndrome, and germline RET mutations\nare present in up to 10% of the patients presenting with apparent-\nly sporadic MTCs.

Strong genotype–phenotype associations\naffecting age at onset (most MTCs occur either in childhood or\nearly adulthood) and tumour aggressiveness have been reported\nfor speciﬁc germline RET mutations. MTCs harbouring somatic\nRET mutations are also commonly associated with more aggres-\nsive behaviour than that of their wild-type RET counterparts. The\nvast majority (91.4%) of sporadic MTCs with distant metastases\nharbour such mutations, in most cases RET M918T (93.8%)\n[144]. There is currently no evidence supporting the value of rou-\ntine screening of MTC patients for somatic RET mutations.\nHowever, if treatment of advanced MTCs with selective RET\ninhibitors is planned, RET testing for somatic mutations is\nneeded to individualise therapy [III, C].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe UICC system is recommended for staging all MTC patients,\nbased on its utility in predicting disease-speciﬁc mortality [IV, A]\n[23]. The eighth edition of this system has introduced some im-\nportant changes in the criteria used for staging thyroid tumours,\nincluding MTCs. Extrathyroidal extension, for example, is now\nimportant only when it is macroscopically evident (pT3b) [23].\nIn the absence of gross extracapsular extension, the primary will\nbe staged solely on the basis of its size (pT1, pT2 or pT3a)\n(Table 2).\nCtn and CEA are valuable diagnostic, prognostic and predict-\nive markers for use with MTC. Their serum concentrations are\ndirectly related to the C-cell mass [145, 146]. Preoperative Ctn\nlevels correlate strongly with tumour diameter and postoperative\nCtn levels. They can also provide useful preoperative information\non the extent of the disease. An analysis of 300 consecutive cases\nof MTC treated with total thyroidectomy and compartment-\noriented lymph node dissections found that preoperative serum\nCtn levels <20 pg/ml (normal reference range: <10 pg/ml) were\nassociated with almost no risk of nodal metastases [147].

Serum Ctn levels exceeding\n500 pg/ml suggest distant metastatic disease and should be\nexplored with additional whole-body imaging procedures.\nSerum Ctn should be measured 60–90 days after thyroidectomy.\nPatients whose postoperative basal serum Ctn level is normal\n(<10 pg/ml) are considered ‘biochemically cured’ and have a 10-\nyear survival rate of 97.7%. However, 3% of patients with normal\nbasal serum Ctn levels following thyroidectomy experience bio-\nchemical recurrence within 7.5 years [143]. CEA is not a speciﬁc\nbiomarker for MTC, and serum assays are not informative for the\nearly diagnosis of MTC. However, they are useful for monitoring\nthe progression of clinically evident MTCs [IV, B] [148–150].\nDoubling times for postoperative serum Ctn and CEA levels\n(deﬁned as the interval of time in which the tumour markers lev-\nels have doubled) are established prognostic markers in MTC\n[IV, B] [148–150]. They are currently considered the best avail-\nable predictors of tumour behaviour, recurrence and cancer-\nrelated death. A Ctn doubling time exceeding 6 months is associ-\nated with 5- and 10-year survival rates of 92% and 37%, respect-\nively; shorter doubling times predict markedly worse survival\n(25% and 8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively) [148]. In patients\nwith poorly differentiated and aggressive MTCs, Ctn values may\nactually decrease over time, whereas CEA levels increase [151].\nDetails on the use of Ctn and CEA doubling times are available\nbelow in the ‘Follow-up, long-term implications and survivor-\nship’ section.\nManagement of local/locoregional disease\nSurgery. Preoperative screening for pheochromocytoma and\nhyperparathyroidism is highly recommended for all patients with\nMTC (except in those already known to have MEN2B) [IV, A]\n[142, 143]. Neck US should be carried out to identify regional\nmetastases; if sonographic (or clinical) ﬁndings are suspicious,\ncontrast-enhanced CT of the neck and chest is indicated. Work-\nup for distant metastases, including chest CT, liver and axial bone\nMRI and 6-ﬂuoro-(18F)-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA)-\nPET scan (if available), should be done if serum Ctn levels exceed\n500 pg/ml or clinical ﬁndings are suspicious. Neck dissection,\nwhen needed, should be done by surgeons with substantial ex-\nperience in TC surgery. The initial approach will depend on pre-\noperative serum Ctn levels and neck imaging ﬁndings (Figure 6)\n[IV, B]. The guidelines in the algorithm are based on retrospect-\nive cohort studies [147, 152]. The grade B recommendation is\nbased on the clinical beneﬁts of elective neck dissection in\npatients with serum Ctn levels <500 pg/ml, for whom surgery\nmay be curative.\nFor carriers of germline mutations, the recommended age for\nprophylactic total thyroidectomy depends on the type of muta-\ntion. Individuals with germline M918T mutations should under-\ngo total thyroidectomy within the ﬁrst year of life. For those with\na C634F or A883F mutation (also considered high risk), surgery\ncan be postponed until age 5 unless Ctn levels increase. Those\nwith other mutations should be monitored from age 5 on with\nCtn assays and neck US, and surgery should be done if Ctn levels\nincrease or if the parents request it [143].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nCtn and CEA monitoring should both be included in the early\nand long-term postoperative staging work-ups [IV, B] [150].\nSerial measurements allow the calculation of doubling times,\nwhich provide useful information as described above. Currently\navailable data indicate that Ctn doubling times should be based\non at least four consecutive measurements, preferably obtained\nover a 2-year period [IV, C] [142, 143]. All measurements must\nbe made by the same laboratory using the same assay. The ATA\nprovides an online calculator for rapid determination of doubling\ntimes from user-supplied series of serum Ctn or serum CEA levels\n[153]. Figure 7 summarises MTC management strategies guided\nby Ctn and CEA levels and doubling times. Clinically relevant dis-\nease sites are rarely detected in patients with Ctn levels <150 pg/\nml, but the likelihood of structural disease increases as Ctn and\nCEA levels rise.\nMultiple imaging modalities should be used to identify locore-\ngional and/or distant metastases [IV, B] [142, 143]. Contrast-\nenhanced whole-body (brain, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis)\nCT with ultra-thin reconstructions is sensitive and speciﬁc\nenough to allow one to estimate the burden of systemic disease\nand to assess and identify target lesions. Target and non-target\nlesions to assess are measured using RECIST v1.1 [94]. Contrast-\nenhanced MRI is more sensitive in identifying liver lesions, which\ncan be misdiagnosed on CT or US as benign cystic lesions. US is\nuseful for assessing neck lymph node involvement, although, as\nmentioned before, it sometimes provides inadequate visualisa-\ntion of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by bone\nor air. For these structures, CT and MRI are more sensitive, pro-\nvide greater morphological detail, and are recommended when\nsurgical interventions, EBRT or other locoregional ablative\napproaches are being planned. MRI is recommended for identify-\ning or excluding brain metastases. Bone scans in MTC patients\nare high in sensitivity but low in speciﬁcity. Whole-body\nbone MRI without contrast medium offers higher speciﬁcity,\nparticularly for osteoblastic lesions.

Disease behaviour varies widely—indolent\nin some cases, rapidly progressive in others—and can be reliably\npredicted by Ctn and CEA doubling times. Advanced MTCs are\ninvariably associated with the secretion of a variety of peptides\n(e.g. prostaglandins, kinins, vasoactive intestinal peptide, sero-\ntonin, histaminase), which can cause unpleasant symptoms such\nas ﬂushing and diarrhoea. Management of these symptoms\nshould be the ﬁrst goal of treatment.\nThe systemic therapies currently approved for MTC have not\nbeen shown to improve OS, so evidence-based guidance is lacking\non when to start these drugs and how patients with indolent\ndisease should be followed. Decisions are based mainly on clini-\ncians’ experience. Multidisciplinary input (e.g. from surgeons,\nendocrinologists, nuclear medicine physicians, medical and radi-\nation oncologists, pain therapists and palliative care specialists) is\nstrongly recommended to ensure optimal care for these patients.\nActive treatment (e.g. locoregional or systemic MKI administra-\ntion) should be considered in the presence of symptoms, lesions\nclose to vital structures, high-tumour burdens or disease progres-\nsion (as deﬁned by RECIST v1.1) [94].\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Cabozantinib [I, A] and vandetanib\n[I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] are the ﬁrst-line systemic treat-\nments for progressive metastatic MTC.

Both drugs inhibit RET kinase activity\nto some extent, and this was the major reason they were originally\nproposed for treating MTC patients. However, their antitumour\neffect is mainly due to their strong inhibition of key angiogenic\npathway components, including vascular endothelial growth fac-\ntor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2).\nThe ZETA trial compared vandetanib (300 mg daily) with pla-\ncebo (2 : 1) in 331 patients with symptomatic and/or metastatic\nMTC [158]. Radiological evidence of disease progression was not\nan enrolment requirement, and placebo-to-vandetanib crossover\nwas allowed if disease progression occurred. The predicted mPFS\nin the vandetanib arm was signiﬁcantly longer than that observed\nin the placebo group (30.5 versus 19.3 months; HR 0.46, 95% CI\n0.31–0.69, P < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the vandetanib\narm (45% versus 13% for placebo, OR 5.48, 95% CI 2.99–10.79,\nP < 0.001), and all but one of the responses in the placebo arm\nwere recorded after crossover to vandetanib. Radiological\nresponses\nwere\naccompanied\nby\nsigniﬁcant\nbiochemical\nresponses (reductions in Ctn and CEA levels in 69% and 52% of\ncases, respectively). Vandetanib exhibited activity independently\nof the tumour’s RET status, previous treatment, metastasis\nsite(s), disease progression status and tumour burden. When the\nZETA data were ﬁrst published, no survival advantage was\nreported for patients managed with vandetanib and no updates\nhave been published since then. In a phase I/II trial of vandetanib\nin children with MTC (two courses at 100 mg/day, then 150 mg/\nday), partial responses were seen in 47% patients, and the AE pro-\nﬁle resembled that observed in adults [160].\nIn the EXAM trial, cabozantinib (140 mg daily) was tested\nagainst placebo (2 : 1) in 330 patients with metastatic MTC [159].\nThe main inclusion criterion was disease progression within the\n14 months preceding study entry. Prior therapy, including MKIs,\nwas allowed, and crossover was not permitted. Compared with\nplacebo, cabozantinib was associated with a signiﬁcantly longer\nmPFS (11.2 versus 4.0 months, HR 0.28, 95% CI, 0.19–0.40,\nP < 0.001) and a higher rate of responses (all partial) (28% versus\n0%, median duration 14.7 months). Efﬁcacy was observed across\nall subgroups, regardless of age, tumour location, tumour bur-\nden, progression rate, prior kinase inhibitor treatment (in 20% of\npatients) or RET/RAS mutation status. mOS rates were similar in\nthe two arms (26.6 versus 21.1 months, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64–\n1.12, P ¼ 0.024), but in the subgroup with RETM918T-positive\nMTCs, cabozantinib was associated with signiﬁcantly longer sur-\nvival (44.3 versus 18.9 months with placebo, HR 0.60, 95% CI\n0.38–0.94, P ¼ 0.03). PFS was consistent with OS in the\nRETM918T-positive\ncases\n(HR\n0.15,\n95%\nCI\n0.08–0.28,\nP < 0.0001) [161].\nAlthough the ZETA and EXAM trials both focused on patients\nwith advanced and/or metastatic disease, their designs and inclu-\nsion criteria were different. The markedly longer mPFS in the pla-\ncebo arm of the ZETA trial—19.3 months [158] versus 4 months\nin EXAM [159]—suggests population differences. Indeed, unlike\nZETA participants, those enrolled in EXAM had to meet RECIST\ncriteria for disease progression and were thus likely to have more\nadvanced disease. The results of the two trials are therefore not\ncomparable, and there is no clear evidence supporting vandetanib\nover cabozantinib as ﬁrst-line treatment. Both are active in ﬁrst-\nand second-line regimens, both prolonged PFS compared with\nplacebo and both displayed RET/RAS status-independent efﬁ-\ncacy. The choice of which drug to use as ﬁrst-line treatment may\nbe based on potential toxicity in each patient (see below).\nHowever, cabozantinib, in a subgroup analysis, demonstrated a\nsigniﬁcant advantage in PFS and OS in patients with RETM918T\nor RAS-mutant MTCs [II, C] [161]. As noted for lenvatinib, re-\ncently released real world data on the efﬁcacy of vandetanib in\nMTC patients are somewhat less encouraging than those gener-\nated in the highly selected population of RCTs [162].\nOther anti-angiogenic MKIs (e.g. sorafenib, motesanib, pazo-\npanib, sunitinib, lenvatinib) have already undergone phase II\ntesting in advanced MTC patients. The most interesting results\nregarded sunitinib and lenvatinib, which were associated with\nresponse rates of 50% and 36%, respectively [157]. Thus far,\nhowever, no MKIs have been approved for second-line use. A\nrandomised trial assessing the efﬁcacy of nintedanib as second-\nline MKI therapy was prematurely closed due to ﬂat enrolment\n(NCT01788982). The more selective RET inhibitors (e.g.\nLOXO-292-NCT03157128,\nBLU-667-NCT03037385)\nappear\npromising and are now under investigation. The RET-\nsuppressing activity of these drugs is essential to their antitu-\nmour effects in MTC, whereas their anti-angiogenic activity is\nnegligible.\nManagement of side-effects: AEs are very common during MKI\ntherapy, and their management is critical for optimising these\ncompounds’ therapeutic ratios. In the ZETA trial, 35% of the\npatients in the vandetanib arm required dose reductions and 12%\ndiscontinued treatment due to toxicity [158]. The most common\nTable 9.

Corrected QT interval\n(QTc) prolongation was a severe, unexpected side-effect in 8% of\ncases. Attempts to reduce the rate of grade 2 or higher AEs with\nan active support programme (including patient contact/visit\nevery 2 weeks and supportive agents such as sunscreen and lo-\nperamide) have been unsuccessful [163]. AEs were also common\nin the EXAM trial, with grade 3 or 4 AEs in 69% of patients\nreceiving cabozantinib. The most common were diarrhoea\n(15.9%), hand–foot syndrome (12.6%) and fatigue (9.3%). Pre-\nexisting disease-related diarrhoea can be worsened by MKI ther-\napy (as a drug-related AE) or improved as a direct effect of the\ndrug’s activity. Increased TSH levels were reported in 57% of the\ncabozantinib-treated patients. TSH levels should be monitored\ncontinuously during treatment, as these patients are generally on\nhormone-replacement therapy if they have undergone total thy-\nroidectomy. Levels should be kept within the normal range: TSH\nsuppression produces no beneﬁts in patients with MTC (unlike\nthose with DTC). AEs associated with VEGF-pathway inhibition\n(e.g. hypertension, haemorrhage, ﬁstula formation, gastrointes-\ntinal\nperforation)\noccurred\nmore\nfrequently\namong\ncabozantinib-treated patients than in those treated with placebo.\nIn the EXAM trial, 79% of patients in the cabozantinib arm\nhad dose reductions, 65% interrupted treatment due to AEs, and\n16% stopped treatment because of toxicities. Randomised trials\nare underway to assess the activities of lower, potentially less\ntoxic doses of vandetanib (150 versus 300 mg, NCT01496313)\nand\ncabozantinib\n(140 mg\ncapsules\nversus\n60 mg\npills,\nNCT01896479).\nThe preliminary results comparing the effects of the two doses\nof vandetanib in patients with advanced MTC have been posted\non ClinicalTrials.gov and showed that the starting dose of 150 mg\nis equally effective as the high 300 mg dose in term of ORR.\nInterruption of treatment and dose reductions are the most\ncommon means for managing AEs. Most decrease in intensity\nafter a few days of withdrawal, but vandetanib AEs may be more\npersistent, given the drug’s 19-day half-life. However, frequent\ninterruptions might reduce the efﬁcacy of MKIs and/or trigger\ncertain escape mechanisms. Most AEs (e.g. hypertension, diar-\nrhoea) are well known and preventable. Useful guidelines for pre-\nventing and managing treatment-related AEs in these complex\ncases have been published by several societies. As for fertility pres-\nervation, the same measures taken for DTC patients are valid for\nthose with MTC.\nConventional\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nradionuclide\ntherapy:\nSystemically administered ChT has historically yielded poor\nresults in MTC. The available data have been generated by retro-\nspective analyses of small, single-institution cases series. The\nmost active drugs have been doxorubicin alone or combined with\ncisplatin, which achieved a response in around 20% at best, or as\na combination with 5-ﬂuorouracil and dacarbazine which did\nnot result in much greater responses [157].\nRadionuclide therapy is an option in selected cases [III, C]. The\nactivity of yttrium-90–DOTA-[D-Phe1-Tyr3]-octreotide (90Y-\nDOTATOC) was tested in a phase II trial including 31 patients\nwith metastatic MTC and increasing Ctn levels. Post-treatment\ndecreases in Ctn levels (the primary endpoint) occurred in 29%\nof the patients treated, and survival beneﬁts were also observed in\nthe responders [164]. RCTs have not been carried out to compare\nthe efﬁcacies of radionuclide and MKI therapies. Ideally, this\ncomparison should be done within a clinical trial setting. In short,\nthere is little evidence to support the use of either ChT or radio-\nnuclide therapy in patients with MTC, although either might be\nconsidered when MKIs are contraindicated.\nMethodology\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in accordance\nwith the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical\nPractice\nGuidelines\ndevelopment,\nhttp://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology.

Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may\nsecrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF\nto functional status.10\nRecommendation\n\u0002 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,\ngrading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and\nsynaptophysin should be reported. SSTR staining or spe-\nciﬁc staining for peptide hormones and amines as well as\nuse of molecular markers is optional and dependent on\nclinical requirements [III, A].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nDisease stage and tumour grade are the two major indepen-\ndent prognostic parameters and should always be assessed\n[III, A]. Since the WHO 2010 classiﬁcation, NENs are graded\nTable 1.

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic\nradical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph\nnodes can be achieved in \u000480% of cases if carried out by\nexperienced surgeons.40\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locore-\ngional\ndisease\nin\nNET\nG1\nand\nG2.\nBefore\nany\nFigure 2.

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].

However, in aggressive NENs (NEC\nG3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy\n(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are\nwarranted.\nMedical therapy\nThe goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-\nassociated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].\nTreatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-\ntide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning\nNETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved\nin 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations\n[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also\nnamed biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in\nNETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the\nmultiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been\nintroduced more recently in the management of NETs.

Most frequently, they are used in\nﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the\nsettings in which they have been studied. Overall response\nrates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48].

The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%). Other side-effects include\nhypertension (26%), lymphopaenia (26%) and hair colour\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.\nThe stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.\nA watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

The NETTER-2 trial has recently been\ninitiated to address this issue (NCT03972488).\nTreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE is in general considered\nsafe, however, up to 3%e4% of the patients may develop\nirreversible bone marrow toxicity such as leukaemia or bone\nmarrow dysplasia. Mild renal toxicity grade 1/2 has been re-\nported long term in 30% of the patients (see Section 5 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline).\nFor more information about PRRT and SSA combination\nand maintenance therapy, see Section 6 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 A surgical approach is indicated in selected patients\naffected by stage IV GEP-NETs who show exclusive or pre-\ndominant liver disease after careful evaluation of tumour\ngrading, distribution of LMs and primary site [IV, B].\n\u0002 Upfront surgery is not indicated in the presence of extra-\nabdominal metastases and high-grade GEP-NENs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Presence of an advanced NEC G3 is considered an abso-\nlute contraindication for an upfront surgery [IV, A].\n\u0002 Palliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV,\nC]. However, it is controversial if primary tumour\nremoval in patients with stage IV disease translates to\nan improvement in survival.\n\u0002 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-\ntoms in patients affected by metastatic functioning\nSI-NETs [IV, B].\n\u0002 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms\nrelated to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery\nmay be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered\nin patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].\n\u0002 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].\n\u0002 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].\nHowever, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy\nwith platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].\n\u0002 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid\noptions for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with\nother systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.\nThe choice of the procedures depends on the local\nexpertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and\nthe localisation of liver involvement [V, C].\n\u0002 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be\napplied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve\ncontrol of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-\ntions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)\n[IV, A].\n\u0002 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,\nlocoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-\ntive to systemic treatment [IV, B].\n\u0002 Systemic therapy should be administered to control\ntumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth\n[I, A].\n\u0002 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients\nwith CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,\nglucagonoma) [I, A].\n\u0002 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-\ntristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-\nment to SSAs [I, A].\n\u0002 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve\nsymptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of\nIFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].\n\u0002 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].\n\u0002 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires\ncareful information to be given to the patient before and\ndirectly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper\ntreatment [IV, A].\n\u0002 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on\npathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth\nbehaviour and SSTR imaging.\n\u0002 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients\nwith low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable\ndisease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term\nfavourable prognosis.\n\u0002 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for\ntumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing\nSSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,\nA; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. Positive SSTR\nstatus is generally required but is not predictive of\nresponse.\n\u0002 IFN-a can be considered for antiproliferative therapy\nif other treatment options have been exploited or\nare not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative on functional\nimaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where there\nare fewer therapy options compared with Pan-NETs\n[IV, B].\n\u0002 Everolimus is EMA-approved for progressive Pan-NET G1/\nG2 with or without prior ChT, for NF-GI and lung NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In GI NETs, everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive disease [I, A].\n\u0002 The use of everolimus after PRRT is recommended in\nintestinal NETs, if PRRT is available [V, A], although the\ntreatment sequence needs to be further studied in the\nabsence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\n\u0002 The combination therapy of SSA and everolimus for an\nantiproliferative purpose is not recommended [II, D].\nM.

Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence.

Patients with carcinoids are generally\nyounger, have a better prognosis and do not have a strong\nassociation with smoking, as compared with SCLC and\nLCNEC.1 The incidence of LC is very low, ranging from 0.2-2/\n100 000 persons/year in both the United States and\nEurope.2,3 Numbers are increasing, likely due to increased\nawareness and improved diagnostic techniques, although it\nmay also be a genuine overall increase in incidence.2,3 LCs\naccount for 20%-25% of all NETs and 1%-2% of all lung\ncancers. LCs prevail slightly more often in women than in\nmen. LCs occur during the ﬁfth or sixth decade of life for TC\nand a decade later for AC.4-10\nThC is an extremely rare tumour accounting for an age-\nadjusted rate of 0.02/100 000-0.18/100 000/year in the\nEuropean or USA populations, respectively.3,11 In the\nNetherlands cancer registry or the Surveillance, Epidemi-\nology and End Results (SEER) programme database, <0.5%\nof all neuroendocrine neoplasms were ThC, representing 5%\nof thymic tumours.3,11 The incidence of ThC is increasing in\nthe USA population.11 ThC prevails in men and the mean\nage at diagnosis is 55 years.1,11-13\nLC and ThC may also be present in multiple endocrine\nneoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome or when there is a\nfamily history of carcinoid tumours or diffuse pulmonary\nneuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) (Supplementary\nMaterial,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2021.01.003).1,14-17\nRecommendation\n\u0001 The scarcity of LCs and ThCs justiﬁes the therapeutic\nmanagement of these patients by expert multidisci-\nplinary teams in centres grouped within networks (na-\ntional or European networks) for care and research\noptimisation [V, A].\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nLC is revealed by non-speciﬁc tumour-related respiratory\nsymptoms (mainly, central forms) or incidentally (mainly,\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Note: Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last\nupdate December 2020.

A minority of cases present with symp-\ntoms related to hormonal hypersecretion, including carci-\nnoid syndrome (CS), due to serotonin and other compound\nsecretions, Cushing’s syndrome (CuS), due to adrenocorti-\ncotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion and acromegaly, due to\ngrowth\nhormone-releasing\nhormone\n(GHRH)\nsecre-\ntion.5,7,18,19 In a recent large population-based study series\nof 3002 LC patients, CS was present in 229 patients (7.6%)\nat diagnosis.20\nDiagnosis is carried out with bronchoscopic technique,\ntransthoracic biopsy or, less frequently, by mediastinoscopy\nor\nendobronchial\nendoscopic\nultrasonography\n(EBUS)\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).\nSurgery may be carried out upfront after adequate\nmedical\npreparation\nin\nlocalised\nresectable\ntumours\nresembling LCs or in tumours considered at high risk of\nbleeding or hormonal crisis or when previous biopsy has\nfailed. Once the diagnosis is suspected, standardised char-\nacterisation of LC comprises several speciﬁc steps for eval-\nuation that are described in Table 1 [III, B].4-9,18,20-34\nThC is revealed by tumour-related symptoms, or due to\nfunctionally active tumours or by chance.11-13 Diagnostic\nprocedures, including core biopsy under ultrasonography\nguidance, or preferably through a thoracic computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) scan, or upfront surgery following the guidelines for\nthymic tumour diagnosis, should be carried out.35 The authors\nrecommend standardised characterisation of ThC in multidis-\nciplinary expert centres as described in Table 1 [III, B].11,12,32-37\nThe histopathological diagnosis of LC or ThC relies on\ncharacteristic morphological features and on the demon-\nstration of the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour through\nthe immunodetection of a panel of markers including at least\nchromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin, which are usually\nexpressed in all carcinoids. This might be expanded to other\nmarkers such as CD56.1 Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1)\nmay be useful in well-differentiated tumours only, when\npositive, to suggest the lung origin of metastatic tumours.1\nTCs and ACs are distinguished (Supplementary Table S1,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003),\non the basis of mitotic count and presence or absence of\nnecrosis.1 While Ki-67 index is not included in the WHO\ncriteria, the WHO acknowledges that Ki-67 index might be\nuseful for the differential diagnosis between well- or poorly-\ndifferentiated NETs (Supplementary Table S1, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).1 Carcinoids\nare characterised by mutations involving either MEN-1 or\nother genes encoding chromatin-remodelling proteins.38,39\nTP53 and particularly RB1 gene alterations, which are rare\nmolecular events in carcinoids, might be potential tools to\ndiscriminate between well or poorly differentiated categories\nin difﬁcult cases like the recently identiﬁed LC with high\nproliferative features. This new subgroup is deﬁned by a\nmitotic count >10 and/or a Ki-67 index >20%, and a well-\ndifferentiated morphology (Supplementary Table S2, avail-\nable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).39-43\nThe ratio between TC and AC is about 6 : 10 in surgical se-\nries but may be closer to 1 : 1 in advanced cases.1,4,6,7,20\nThe ThC WHO classiﬁcation is identical to that of lung\nNETs with four categories including TC or AC deﬁned using\nthe same criteria (Supplementary Table S1, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003). The pattern\nof genetic alterations is different from LC.1,38 As for LCs, a\nsubgroup of ThC with high proliferative features has\nrecently been recognised.44 The ratio between atypical and\ntypical ThC is about 2 : 1.1,33,34,36\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Management of LC and ThC requires a multidisciplinary\nstandardised approach in specialised centres [IV, A]\n\u0001 Ki-67 (MIB 1) [IV, A], TTF1 [IV, B], p53/RB1 [IV, B]\nbiomarker analyses are recommended in selected cases\nfor differential diagnosis or site of origin orientation.\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nRisk assessments depend on pathology and TNM (tumoure\nnodeemetastasis) staging based on the combination of\nTable 1.

Insufﬁcient accuracy of CgA (30%-\n60% at the metastatic stage) makes research on new\nbiomarkers critical. Among these, a multianalyte molecular\nassay [51 transcripts; neuroendocrine tumor test (NETest)]\nis currently under development with potentially better\nsensitivity, but uncertainties remain regarding its positive\npredictive value and role as a prognostic marker for LC.22\nThe application of the 8th Edition of the Union for\nInternational\nCancer\nControl\n(UICC)\nTNM\nstaging\n(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) is recommended even\nif not speciﬁc to LCs.31,46,47 More than 80% of LCs are\ndiagnosed at TNM stage I or II.4,5-7,46 The most common\nsites of metastasis include liver, bone and lung. The diversity\nof metastatic sites and the potential overestimation of lung\nmetastasis and underestimation of brain metastasis must be\ntaken into account.46,47 The WHO classiﬁcation and patho-\nlogical TNM (pTNM) staging are intricate.5,21,48 In a recent\nstudy in which patients underwent \u000310 lymph node\nresection, frequency of positive lymph nodes was 17%\n(including 6% N2-N3) or 46% (including 23% N2-N3) in case\nof TC or AC, respectively.48\nMost ThCs are diagnosed at advanced-stage Masaokae\nKoga (Supplementary Table S5, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) or TNM stage III or\nIV.11,12,32 The most common sites for metastases include the\npleura, pericardium, bone, lung and liver.\nIn LCs, overall survival (OS) is mainly inﬂuenced by WHO\npathology and the pTNM classiﬁcations.1,5,21,45-49 In stage I,\nII, III or IV LC patients, 10-year disease-speciﬁc survival is\n96%, 85%, 81%, 59% and 88%, 75%, 47%, 18%, in TC or AC,\nrespectively, showing the major prognostic inﬂuence of the\nWHO classiﬁcation.46\nAfter resection, WHO classiﬁcation and pathological lymph\nnode staging (pN) status constitute the two main prognostic\nparameters (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).4,5,9,21,45,48-51\nAlthough\nKi-67 index is considered a promising prognostic marker by\nthe whole author panel, its technique of evaluation and the\nmost accurate thresholds remain a matter of debate; more-\nover, no deﬁnitive validation of its added value to WHO and\npTNM classiﬁcations has been provided so far in large series\nof LCs.18,28,45,52,53 At the metastatic stage, WHO classiﬁcation,\nperformance status, CgA levels, tumour burden and so-\nmatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) uptake, as well as tumour\ngrowth slope and the functioning syndrome, should be taken\ninto account for adequate risk assessment [IV, B].47 Prolonged\nsurvival of the majority of patients with LCs (including a 60%\n5-year OS for metastatic LC) makes adjusted toxicity proﬁle of\ntherapeutic interventions critical [V, A].47\nThe prognosis of patients with thymic NETs remains poor:\nin retrospective series, 5- or 10-year OS was 28%-72% or\n26%-60%, respectively.11-14,33 Based on a few large, retro-\nspective thymic NETs series, OS is inﬂuenced by stage,\nmainly\ntumour\nsize\nand\ncompleteness\nof\nresection\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).11-13,32,33,36 No speciﬁc staging\nsystem has yet been validated for ThC. The authors there-\nfore recommend the use of both staging systems (TNM,\nMasaokaeKoga) together with the WHO classiﬁcation and\nresection status for adequate prognostic stratiﬁcation.1\nRecommendations\n\u0001 WHO and pTNM classiﬁcations constitute the basis of\nthe prognostic classiﬁcation [II, B]\n\u0001 i.v. contrast-enhanced cross-sectional conventional imag-\ning including liver late arterial phase and PET-CT with\n68Ga-labelled SSAs constitute the basis of TNM evalua-\ntion [II, B]\n\u0001 Speciﬁc prognostic factors including tumour growth rate\nor presence of functioning syndromes are taken into ac-\ncount in advanced-stage LCs and ThCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Prolonged survival of most patients with LCs makes\nadjusted toxicity proﬁle of therapeutic interventions crit-\nical [V, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE,\nLOCAL RECURRENCE AND ADJUVANT THERAPY\nLocal/locoregional disease treatment\nControl of a functioning syndrome must be considered\nbefore any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]. Surgery\nrepresents the treatment of choice for LCs (both TCs and\nACs), even in the case of N2 lymph nodal metastases [IV,\nA].54 The surgical approach depends on tumour size, loca-\ntion and preoperative biopsy specimen assessment. The\nchoice of open surgery or minimally invasive approaches\nwill depend on the experience of the surgeon. Patients with\nsmall peripheral nodules may be candidates for minimally\ninvasive access including lung resection and lymph node\ndissection (usually a video-assisted lobectomy/segmentec-\ntomy). The surgical access for centrally located tumours,\nthose with suspected/proven metastatic lymph nodes,\nusually requires thoracotomy, depending on the surgeon’s\nexpertise.\nAnatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy,\nlobectomy,\nbilobectomy,\npneumonectomy)\nand\nlymph\nnode resection (with a minimum of six nodal stations:\nthree hilar and three mediastinaldalso including subcarinal\nstationdas recommended by the European Society of\nThoracic Surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer) is the\npreferred extent of resection [IV, B]. Indeed, wedge resec-\ntion may increase the risk of tumour recurrences, especially\nin N-positive TC or intermediate-grade ACs.4,5,55,56 In ACs,\nE. Baudin et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 32\n- Issue 4\n- 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003\n441\n\n---\nbut also in N-positive TCs, lobectomy is reported as superior\nto segmentectomy in terms of OS in some, but not\nall.5,7,8,18,51,54,55,57,58 Bronchoplastic procedures (e.g. sleeve\nresections) are preferred for suitable centrally located tu-\nmours, with the aim of avoiding pneumonectomy [IV B].\nTransfer of patients to specialist centres for sleeve resection\nshould be discussed [IV, B]. Frozen sections of bronchial and\nvascular margins are recommended to rule out tumour\ninvolvement of resection margins, a condition that conse-\nquently imposes a greater pulmonary resection. Systematic\nlymph node dissection is recommended as lymph node\nmetastases may be observed in up to 27% of TCs and in up\nto 47% of ACs, and lymph node resection inﬂuences the\nprognosis and the modality of follow-up5,45,48,49,56 [IV, B].\nR0 resection is achieved in >85% of cases.7,10\nIn case of distal lung parenchyma destruction, there is an\noption for endobronchial resection to relieve the obstruc-\ntion, followed by reassessment and deﬁnitive surgery a few\nweeks later.\nWatchful radiological follow-up, as an alternative to\nsurgery, may be considered in case of cT1N0 carcinoid\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH, but also in MEN-1 patients\nand patients with comorbid conditions, due to the indo-\nlent course of most tumours [IV, C]. Rarely, carcinoids\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH may progress and be\nconsidered\nfor\nsublobar\nresection\n(including\nwedge\nresection), especially in case of large tumour size and/or\npresence of lymph nodes and/or uncontrolled functioning\nsyndrome, as a potential alternative to anatomical surgery\nin these patients to preserve lung function; medical op-\ntions (SSAs) or nonsurgical locoregional therapeutic pro-\ncedures may also constitute potential alternatives to be\ndiscussed case by case [V, C].14,17,24 Patients with non-\nDIPNECH or non-MEN-1 multifocal LC primaries may\nconstitute a distinct entity which may beneﬁt from a\nsimilar management [V, C].59\nUpfront surgery can be offered for all ThCs deemed\nradically resectable [IV, B]. Resectability judgement is\nmostly based on the surgeon’s expertise in thymic surgery.\nProspective registration of these cases is recommended.\nMedian sternotomy is the standard surgical approach and\nless invasive forms of access (video-assisted, robotic-\nassisted) are currently being investigated; in selected\ncases (tumours invasive to the lung, great vessels or with\npleural/pericardial implants), a combined approach (ster-\nnotomy plus anterior thoracotomy) or a thoracotomy are\nrequired to achieve a complete tumour resection. Palliative\nsurgery is not recommended. Lymphadenectomy has his-\ntorically rarely been carried out at the time of resection of\nthymic tumours; however, the latest UICC TNM staging\nsystem recommends that locoregional lymph nodal dissec-\ntion should be carried out also during ThC resection.60 Due\nto the poor prognosis of ThC, prophylactic thymectomy\ncould be discussed in young male adult patients with MEN-\n1 at the time of initial or recurrent parathyroidectomy,\nespecially in families with aggressive thymic tumours [V,\nC];14,15,61\nthe\nbest\nsurgical\napproach\nmay\ninclude\ncervicotomy and upper sternal split or other surgical pro-\ncedures to avoid incomplete thymic resection.\nLocal recurrence therapy\nAfter a median follow-up of 54-121 months, recurrences\noccur in up to 7% of TCs and up to 35% of ACs.4,7,18,53,54\nOne-third are local recurrences.\nIn case of local recurrence, surgical resection with radical\nintent is recommended when technically feasible.

However, it may be\nconsidered in selected ﬁt patients with particularly high risk\nof relapse (i.e. AC N2) after multidisciplinary discussion [IV,\nC].

The most\nfrequent functioning syndrome is CS in LC, which requires\nannual echocardiography screening for carcinoid heart dis-\nease, when present or in case of increased 5-HIAA levels [V,\nC].60 In addition, prospective studies are expected to deter-\nmine the added value of N-terminal pro hormone B-type\nnatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the detection of carcinoid\nheart disease. In contrast, CS is rare in ThC. Based on\napproval and recommendations in gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NET patients with CS, we recommend long-acting SSAs\nas ﬁrst-line symptomatic treatment of CS [V, B].61,63-65 SSAs\nare also an option in DIPNECH patients presenting with res-\npiratory symptoms.65 Among second-line options described\nin Figure 3 and Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003,64-71\nonly\ntelotristat\nethyl has been approved by the European Medicines Agency\n(EMA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) for the treatment of the diarrhoea of refractory CS.

Palliative surgery\nor radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation or endo-\nbronchial treatment (EBT) of the primary tumour are oc-\ncasionally considered in cases of advanced disease at risk of\nlocal events or refractory CS [V, B]. More frequently, liver,\nbone and lung metastases represent potential targets for\nsuch strategies with the triple objectives of reducing the\nlocoregional risks, the primary tumour and the secretory\nburden (Figures 3 and 4). Such multiple locoregional man-\nagement may represent the only anti-tumour strategy in\npatients with slowly progressive tumours (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) [V, B].67,68,73-75\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Palliative surgery or locoregional procedures (RFA, cryoa-\nblation, EBT) of the primary tumour are occasionally\nconsidered in cases of advanced disease at risk of local\nevents or refractory CS [V, B]\n\u0001 Multiple locoregional therapies including surgery, com-\nbined or not with SSAs, are recommended to decrease\nthe tumour burden, to control hormonal secretions\nand to prevent local complications, as a ﬁrst-line thera-\npeutic approach in patients with advanced slowly pro-\ngressing LC [V, B].\nSystemic anti-tumour therapy\nSystemic anti-tumour therapies of patients with advanced\nLC are various, including SSAs, ChT, everolimus, peptide\nreceptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and interferon-a (IFN-\na) (Figure 4). These systemic therapies should be discussed\nwithin expert multidisciplinary teams for patients with\nmorphologically progressive tumours, high tumour burden\nor refractory functioning syndromes. No speciﬁc phase III\ntrial for LC exclusively has been published so far, therefore\nevidence comes mostly from retrospective analyses, less\nfrom phase II, single-arm trials, and sporadically from\nrandomised phase II or subgroups of phase III trials that\nenrolled a majority of GEP-NET patients. Everolimus is the\nonly treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA for LC.\nBased on the very limited data available in advanced ThC,\nwe recommend applying the same strategy as for LC.\nSSAs\nOctreotide [long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg] and lanreotide\n(120 mg) are the two SSAs most commonly used in clinical\npractice. Both showed antiproliferative activity and gains in\ntime to progression or progression-free survival (PFS) in\nplacebo-controlled, phase III trials enrolling good prognostic\nor\nslowly\nprogressive\nGEP-NETs,64\nwhere\nthey\nwere\napproved by the FDA and EMA for antiproliferative pur-\nposes. The placebo-controlled, randomised phase III trial,\nwhich evaluated lanreotide 120 mg in advanced LC, was\nstopped\nfor\ninsufﬁcient\nenrolment\n(SPINET\ntrial\nNCT02683941). Therefore, the feasibility of phase III trials in\nLC remains an issue. Two dedicated retrospective case series\nreported potential positive impact of SSAs, with a PFS of 17\nand 11 months, respectively.76,77 In the single, published,\nrandomised phase II LUNA trial, pasireotide 60 mg every 4\nweeks, in ﬁrst or second line after standard SSA therapy,\nachieved a 39% progression-free rate (PFR) at 9 months, in\na series of 41 LCs or ThCs with Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumours (RECIST) progression before enrolment\n(LUNA study). The PFR was not signiﬁcantly different from\nthat achieved with everolimus alone.20 On this basis, the\nauthors recommend SSA, for its better tolerability, as ﬁrst-\nline therapy in TC or slowly progressing somatostatin re-\nceptor (SSTR)-positive LC [IV, C].\nTargeted therapies\nEverolimus has been investigated in several clinical trials\nwhich included metastatic LCs and is currently the most\nstudied agent in LC. The RADIANT-4 study represents the\nlargest series of LCs ever included in a phase III trial\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10\n.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).78,79 Based on these results,\nthe FDA and EMA approved everolimus in advanced, pro-\ngressing, non-functional pulmonary and digestive NETs in\n2016. Furthermore, in the RADIANT-4 trial, everolimus\ndelayed\ntumour\nprogression\nwhile\npreserving\noverall\nhealth-related QoL.80 Everolimus has been reported to be\npotentially effective also in a post hoc analysis of the\nRADIANT-2 trial regarding a subgroup of LC associated with\na history of CS (Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).71,81\nEver-\nolimus is considered as ﬁrst-line therapy in the majority of\nACs or following progression to SSA for both TC and AC\npatients [II, B] (see Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003 for detailed\nLUNA trial data).\nE.

It affects predominantly older,\nfair-skinned Caucasians and exhibits aggressive behaviour\nwith a high recurrence rate and a propensity for early\nmetastasis.1 Despite new advances in therapies for MCC,\nthe prognosis remains poor. With the incidence of MCC\nincreasing rapidly across Europe, prompt diagnosis and\neffective and harmonised management are imperative for\nimproving patient care.2\nThe European Parliament and the European Commission\nrecommend treating patients with rare cancers in centres\nlinked to the European Reference Network for Rare Adult\nSolid Cancers (EURACAN). In these referral centres with a\nhigh volume of MCC patients, the clinical experience of a\nmultidisciplinary team (MDT) specialising in skin cancers\nguarantees better treatment outcomes and access to\nclinical trials. Therefore, the objective of this guideline is to\nprovide a comprehensive reference for MCC, which is based\non a critical evaluation of current evidence and opinion of\nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) experts in\npartnership with EURACAN.\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nThe global incidence rates of MCC are difﬁcult to calculate\nbecause of its rarity, geographic and demographic vari-\nability and lack of large epidemiological studies.3 Since its\nﬁrst description in 1972, MCC incidence rates have\nsteadily increased, likely due to both the reﬁnements in\ndiagnostic capabilities and the progressively ageing pop-\nulation.4,5 The Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe\n(RARECARE) database reported the crude incidence esti-\nmate as 0.13 per 100 000 in 1995-2002.6 The incidence\nrate reported over time in the recent analysis of the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data-\nbase showed that in 1986, incidence and mortality rates\nper 100 000 were 0.22 and 0.03, respectively; these rates\nincreased to 0.79 and 0.43, respectively, in 2011.7 The\nhighest incidence rates of MCC are in Australia, where the\nage-adjusted incidence rate reported in Queensland was\n1.6 per 100 000.8\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: February 2024.\n2059-7029/© 2024 The Author(s).

In Australia, this\nis the opposite, with 80% UV- and 20% MCPyV-related.3\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nClinical diagnosis\nThe clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional lymph nodes (LNs),\ncomorbid conditions and patient life expectancy. MCC\nclassically presents as a pink or red-violaceous, painless,\nﬁrm, rapidly growing, dome-shaped or red plaque skin\nlesion, ranging in size from 1 to 2 cm. It typically occurs in\nolder patients in sun-exposed areas of their bodies. The\npredominant sites of MCC localisation include the head and\nneck (45%), upper limbs (24%), lower limbs (10%) and trunk\nor other sites (<10%), while in 11% of cases, there is no\nidentiﬁable primary lesion. Ulceration may occur in more\nadvanced MCC lesions. MCC enlarges rapidly, metastasises\nin transit to the skin and/or to ﬁrst-echelon LNs (26% of\ncases at initial presentation) and then to higher-order nodal\nregions and distant sites such as bones, liver and brain (8%\nof cases at initial presentation).12 MCC may be mis-\ndiagnosed as squamous- or basal-cell carcinoma, amela-\nnotic melanoma, adnexal tumour, primary cutaneous B-cell\nlymphoma or skin disorders such as pyogenic granuloma\nand\ninﬂammatory\ndisorders.13\nSince\nMCC\nhas\nbeen\nobserved contiguous to, or intermingled with, other skin\ncancers, the detection of polymorphous vessels and/or\nmilky-red areas by dermatoscopy enhances the differential\ndiagnostic accuracy, especially for patients with multiple\nskin lesions.14\nAetiology and molecular biology\nDespite major advances in understanding MCC carcino-\ngenesis, the cellular origin of MCC is still unclear. MCC has\nbeen hypothesised to originate from dermal ﬁbroblasts,\npre-/pro-B cells, Merkel-cell precursors potentially derived\nfrom epidermal stem cells and hair follicle stem cells.15 MCC\ncarcinogenesis can be initiated in the cell of origin either by\nUV-mediated DNA damage caused by chronic exposure to\nsunlight or by integration of the MCPyV into the host\ngenome.16,17 MCPyV is a ubiquitous virus usually acquired\nduring childhood, as indicated by frequent seropositivity of\nantibodies against the capsid protein VP1 in the blood.18\nHowever, primary infection with MCPyV does not cause\nany discernible signs or symptoms. Despite the high prev-\nalence of MCPyV infection, very few people develop MCC.\nAn essential feature of MCPyV-associated MCC is that the\ntumour cells express speciﬁc products of the viral early\ngenes, i.e. small T antigen (ST) and a truncated version of\nlarge T antigen (LT). LT and ST have also been referred to as\nviral oncoproteins, and their capacity to interact with mul-\ntiple cellular proteins, thereby altering their function, has\nbeen demonstrated.19,20 While MCPyV-associated MCCs are\ncharacterised by very low frequencies of somatic mutations,\nvirus-negative MCCs are among the tumours with the\nhighest mutational load, typically displaying UV signa-\ntures.21 Among the aberrations found in MCPyV-negative\nMCC,\nmutations\ndisrupting\nthe\ngene\nencoding\nthe\nretinoblastoma-associated protein RB1 (the key protein\ncontrolling cell cycle entry) are almost always present.\nAnalogously, RB1 function in virus-associated MCC is\ninhibited by binding the LXCXE motif of LT to RB1; in either\ncase, cells are unable to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell\ncycle.21 Interestingly, MCPyV is not found in cases of MCC\nassociated with cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, indi-\ncating that it does not play a part in these combined\ntumours.22,23\nHistopathology\nHistopathological features of MCC are those of a small-blue-\nround-cell tumour with a vesicular nucleus and scant\ncytoplasm.24 However, several different histopathological\npatterns exist, including trabecular, intermediate and small-\ncell variants. Neoplastic cells can also be large and may\npresent with a pleomorphic morphology. The nucleoli are\nmultiple and usually not prominent. Mitotic and apoptotic\nrates are frequently high. The tumour regularly inﬁltrates\nthe reticular dermis and subcutis. The epidermis, papillary\ndermis and adnexal structures are usually spared, although\nepidermotropism is observed in up to 10% of cases. The\npresence of intra-lymphatic emboli and isolated tumour\ncells close to the surgical margins may explain the high rate\nof local recurrences.24,25 As the histomorphology of MCC on\nhaematoxylineeosin (H&E) sections is rather nonspeciﬁc,\nthe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires immunohisto-\nchemical staining to rule out other tumours that display a\nsmall-blue-round-cell morphology (e.g. basal-cell carci-\nnoma; metastatic small-cell carcinoma, particularly from the\nlung; cutaneous lymphoma; anaplastic sweat gland carci-\nnoma; melanoma; Ewing’s sarcoma; neuroblastoma and\nrhabdomyosarcoma).24\nMCC cells express several types of cytoskeletal keratins\n(CKs), particularly CK20 (membranous and/or paranuclear\ndot-like), CK8, CK18 and CK19. A small subset of MCCs\n(<10%) are negative for CK20; these cases are characterised\nby a high mutational burden and are generally not associ-\nated with MCPyV. In addition to CKs, neoplastic cells also\nexpress chromogranin A, synaptophysin, cluster of differ-\nentiation\n(CD)56,\nneuron-speciﬁc\nenolase\n(NSE)\nand\nhuntingtin-interacting protein 1. MCC is usually negative for\nthyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), leukocyte common\nantigen, melan A, mammalian achaete-scute homologue 1,\nvimentin, protein S100 and CK7.23,24,26 However, rare cases\nESMO Open\nI. Lugowska et al.\n2\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\n\n---\nof MCC can be positive for TTF1 or CK7, and so interpre-\ntation of the staining patterns of these two antigens should\nbe carried out with caution. These markers should be\nincluded in an immunopanel for MCC conﬁrmation and\nexclusion of other diagnostic considerations.\nNo histological marker has been reliably associated with\nthe selective identiﬁcation of either virus- or UV-associated\nMCC: while positive staining for MCPyV LT strongly suggests\nan MCPyV-associated MCC, negative staining does not\nnecessarily rule it out.27,28 Although all of these markers are\nhelpful and essential for diagnosis, particularly in the\npresence of artefacts, no convincing evidence supports their\nuse to predict prognosis or response to therapy. Concerning\nthe latter, variable numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating cytotoxic\nT lymphocytes (not identiﬁed, brisk, non-brisk) are found in\nMCC tumours, and their presence is associated with a\nbetter prognosis, which is particularly favourable if their T-\ncell receptor repertoire is characterised by clonal diversity.29\nThe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires histopatholog-\nical examination of tissue obtained by incisional/excisional\nbiopsy.4 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other tissues such\nas fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical margins;\ntumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratumoural\nlymphocyte\ninﬁltration;\nimmunohistochemical\nproﬁle;\nMCPyV status and mitotic rate.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional LNs, comorbid\nconditions and patient life expectancy [III, A].\n\u0003 Histopathological MCC conﬁrmation should include H&E\nwith the dedicated immunopanel [III, A].\n\u0003 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other structures\nsuch as fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical mar-\ngins; tumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratu-\nmoural lymphocyte inﬁltration; immunohistochemical\nproﬁle; MCPyV status and mitotic rate [III, A].\n\u0003 Dermatoscopymayenhancedifferentialdiagnosticaccuracy,\nespecially for patients with multiple skin lesions [IV, B].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nThe preferred classiﬁcation is the eighth version of the\nUnion\nfor\nInternational\nCancer\nControl\n(UICC)\nTNM\n(tumourenodeemetastasis) staging and classiﬁcation sys-\ntem, which provides information for both management and\nprognosis of patients with MCC (see Supplementary\nTables\nS1-S4,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nesmoop.2024.102977).30 This classiﬁcation was developed\nbased on data collected from 9387 patients with MCC in the\nNational Cancer Database. Staging and risk assessment\nprocedures are determined based on disease presentation\nat diagnosis.31\nThe initial evaluation in MCC should include a complete\nexamination of the skin with particular attention to any\nsuspicious cancerous skin lesions, tumour satellites, in-\ntransit metastases, regional LNs and systemic metastases.\nThe assessment of disease extension in all patients is\nmandatory: ultrasound of regional LNs for patients with\nclinical stage I-II disease and computed tomography (CT) of\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis (and head/neck for head/\nneck primaries).32 Positron emission tomography (PET)eCT\nappears more sensitive than CT alone based on published\nmeta-analyses and other retrospective studies; it was\nshown that 16.8% of patients who underwent PETeCT had\ntheir disease upstaged compared with 6.9% of those who\nunderwent CT scans only.33,34 Therefore, if PET and/or PETe\nCT with [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) are available,\nthey are the preferred cross-sectional imaging methods to\nassess local and distant disease.16 If additional clinical\nsymptoms are present, detailed imaging studies using\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be carried out.\nSentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) with an appropriate immuno-\npanel is considered the most reliable staging procedure for\nidentifying subclinical nodal involvement. As such, it is\nrecommended for all patients with clinically node-negative\ndisease who are ﬁt for radical therapy. SLNB should be\ncarried out alongside local surgical therapy of the primary\ntumour with special attention to drainage patterns. The\nobserved 17.1% false-negative SLNB results may occur in\nimmunocompromised patients or tumours localised in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region.35,36 SLNB enables the\ndetection of micrometastases in approximately one-third of\npatients with clinically node-negative MCC, and its positivity\nrate is w20% for T1 and 40%-50% for T2 MCCs.37-39 In\nchallenging locations for SLNB, single-photon emission\ncomputed tomographyeCT techniques should be utilised.40\nAccess to a full pathological report with the number of\ninvolved LNs, the size of metastatic deposits and the status\nof the extracapsular extension is crucial for staging, pre-\ndiction and decision making.41 Patients with clinically\napparent nodal disease at presentation with an unknown\nprimary should have a biopsy for histological conﬁrmation\nof MCC.12,42\nThe 5-year overall survival (OS) in all MCC patients is be-\ntween 48% and 63%: 64% in patients without metastases\n(stage I-II), 51% in those with regional LN involvement (stage\nIII), 68% in those with an unknown primary tumour and 17%-\n29% in patients with distant metastases (stage IV).39,43-45\nRetrospective data have shown that unfavourable clinical\nprognostic factors are the presence of regional and distant\nmetastases, primary tumour diameter >2 cm and/or its\nextension beyond the dermis, location in the head/neck\nregion, >75 years of age, male sex and presence of co-\nmorbidity, especially immunosuppression (e.g. HIV, chronic\nlymphocytic leukaemia).3,39,43,46 The poor prognosis has\nalso been linked to histopathological futures such as posi-\ntive margins after resection, a high mitotic rate, inﬁltrative\n(rather than circumscribed) growth pattern, lymphovascular\ninﬁltration and p63 expression, whereas LT and RB1 protein\nexpression and intratumoural CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltra-\ntion correlate with a more favourable prognosis.10,12,24\nHowever, there are no prospective data available in MCC.\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n3\n\n---\nProgrammed\ndeath-ligand\n1\n(PD-L1)\nexpression\nis\nfrequently detected in MCC tumour cells and the tumour\nmicroenvironment. Nevertheless, its expression does not\ncorrelate with prognosis.47-49 Serum markers such as anti-\nbodies against MCPyV or NSE require further prospective\nvalidation.50,51\nRecommendations\n\u0003 SLNB is indicated to improve prognostic staging, e.g. to\nrule out occult nodal disease, but the precision of\nSLNB is less reliable in immunocompromised patients\nand in patients whose tumours are located in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region and with aberrant\nLN drainage [III, A].\n\u0003 Mandatory imaging studies comprise CT scans of the\nchest, abdomen, pelvis and head/neck (for head/neck\nprimaries). If available, whole-body FDGePET/CT is pref-\nerable over contrast-enhanced CT scan; MRI imaging of\nspeciﬁc organs should be carried out if clinically indi-\ncated [III, A].\n\u0003 The value of immunohistological markers, such as p63,\nPD-L1, NSE or CD200, is not fully established [IV, B].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nThe mainstay of treatment for patients with localised MCC\nis wide local excision (WLE) followed by tumour bed\nradiotherapy (RT) and management of the nodal basin. A\nproposed algorithm for the management of locoregional\nMCC is shown in Figure 1.\nSince wide excision can potentially compromise lymphatic\ndrainage, an SLNB should be carried out simultaneously with\nsurgical treatment of the primary MCC. A precise surgical\ntechnique called Mohs surgery may be considered instead of\nWLE in selected cases based on results from meta-analyses of\npatients with stage I MCC, which showed similar recurrence\nrates for both surgical modalities: local recurrence rates were\n6.8% for WLE versus 8.5% for Mohs surgery, and regional\nrecurrence rates were similar at w15%, although no rando-\nmised trials comparing traditional WLE with Mohs surgery\nwere included in these meta-analyses.52\nAfter resection, there is a need to obtain a clear patho-\nlogical margin, although the size of surgical margin is under\ndebate.53 In one publication, a margin >2 cm was associ-\nated with a signiﬁcant improvement in OS54; however, other\ndata have not supported a correlation between margin size\nbeyond 1 cm and additional clinical beneﬁt. In a study of\n6156 patients with localised MCC, resection margins >1 cm\nwere associated with improvements in OS compared with\nmargins of <1 cm; 5-year survival rates were 90% and 77%\n(P < 0.001), respectively.55\nAccording\nto\nﬁndings\nfrom\na\nretrospective\nstudy\ncomprising a cohort of patients who had clear margins\nfollowing resection and received post-operative RT, surgical\nexcision with margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus >1.0 cm was not\nassociated with any signiﬁcant difference in terms of OS,\nany recurrence-free survival (RFS) or local RFS.56 Thus,\nsurgical margins might be reduced to avoid reconstruction,\nespecially for preserving cosmetics (face) or function (lo-\ncations close to joints). Findings from this retrospective\nstudy also showed that excision, even with narrow margins\n(0.5-1.0 cm), was not associated with outcome. Cancer-\nspeciﬁc survival was 76.8% versus 76.2% for patients with\nresection margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus 1-2 cm, respectively.\nHowever, for patients with narrow resection margins, post-\noperative RT to the tumour bed is mandatory.56 In sum-\nmary, there is a need to obtain surgical margins of 1-2 cm\nand histologically negative margins, if feasible, which must\nbe followed by adjuvant RT regardless of the type of sur-\ngery.15,57-59\nThe beneﬁt of adjuvant RT following excision of the pri-\nmary tumour was shown in a systematic review and meta-\nanalysis considering >17 000 patients with stages I-III MCC\nfrom 29 observational studies.60 A favourable OS beneﬁt\nwas associated with surgery plus adjuvant RT versus surgery\nalone [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)\n0.75-0.86, P < 0.001]. The study also reported a signiﬁcant\nbeneﬁt in locoregional and local disease-free survival (DFS),\nbut not distant DFS (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.22-0.42; HR 0.21, 95%\nCI 0.14-0.33 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49-1.14, respectively).60\nThe largest series to date to assess whether adjuvant\ntherapy was associated with better survival included 6908\ncases from the National Cancer Database.61 It showed that\nfor localised MCC, surgery and adjuvant RT was associated\nwith a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in OS compared\nwith surgery alone (stage I: HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80; stage\nII: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89), but in patients with regional\nnodal metastases (stage III), neither the addition of adju-\nvant RT nor chemotherapy (ChT) had a signiﬁcant impact on\nOS. These ﬁndings suggest that the addition of RT may\nbeneﬁt the local control of localised disease; however, it is\nreasonable to believe that survival in patients with more\nadvanced disease may be driven by the presence of sub-\nclinical distant metastasis.61\nIt is worth noting that the MCC patient population con-\ntains elderly patients, which frequently causes clinicians to\ndeviate from standard treatment protocols. This was\nrecently\nillustrated\nin\na\nstudy\nthat\ninvestigated\nthe\nconcordance to adjuvant treatment guidelines in patients\nwith stage I-II MCC.62 Of the 2330 patients in this study,\n1858 had an indication for adjuvant RT [according to Na-\ntional Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines\ncriteria63] but only 57% of these patients received RT; those\nwho received RT had a 5-year OS advantage over those who\ndid not (76% versus 68%, P < 0.0003). Conversely, of the\n472 patients without an indication for adjuvant RT (ac-\ncording to NCCN criteria), 43% received RT; this group did\nnot show an OS beneﬁt over those who did not receive RT\n(79% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.48).62\nThe optimal adjuvant RT dose is unclear.64 In a retro-\nspective study of 2093 patients who underwent surgery\nfollowed by adjuvant RT, four groups of patients receiving\ndifferent doses of RT (30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy, 50-55 Gy and 55-\n70 Gy) were analysed; the 3-year OS rates were 41.8%,\n69.0%, 69.2% and 66.0%, respectively.65 An Australian study\nESMO Open\nI. Lugowska et al.\n4\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\n\n---\ndocumenting a dose response showed that no patients with\nmacroscopic MCC developed in-ﬁeld relapses at doses\n>56 Gy.66 Furthermore, in a large population-based study\nof patients with head and neck-located MCC (N ¼ 1625)\nundergoing adjuvant RT (85% with negative margins and\n15% with residual MCC), a dose range of 50-55 Gy conferred\na survival advantage compared with doses <50 Gy. There\nwas no signiﬁcant improvement by escalating doses beyond\nthis range, which could reﬂect toxicity-related morbidity or\ndeath from competing risks in this mostly older patient\ncohort.65 Therefore, a radiation dose of 50-60 Gy is often\nrecommended in MCC, achieving in-ﬁeld control.\nIn some patients, surgical therapy is not feasible due to\nthe extent of disease (technically inoperable) or the pres-\nence of signiﬁcant (co)morbidity. Since MCC is radiosensi-\ntive, RT as a single modality is an alternative to surgery in\nthis group. The natural history of patients treated with\ndeﬁnitive RT is out-of-ﬁeld relapse with in-ﬁeld control\nachieved in most patients.38 In a systematic review, an\nalmost 90% in-ﬁeld control rate was documented following\ndeﬁnitive RT with a mean dose delivered of just under\n50 Gy.38 Recurrences occurred at 39/332 sites (13 local\nrelapses, 26 regional) for a cumulative post-RT in-ﬁeld\nrecurrence rate of 11.7%. Of note, there was no association\nbetween RT dose and incidence of recurrence or non-\nrecurrence. RT of the primary tumour can also be curative\nwhen excision is not possible due to severe comorbidity\ndisqualifying the patient from surgery or in individuals who\nrefuse surgical treatment.67 However, there is also a lack\nof consensus regarding the optimal dose/fractionation\nschedule. Independently, the European Consensus-based\ninterdisciplinary guideline and NCCN guidelines propose\ndoses of 60-66 Gy for deﬁnitive treatment of patients with\ngrossly positive primary tumour resection margins and/or\nclinically evident lymphadenopathy.15,63\nManagement of early-stage MCC (stage I-II)\nIn the early stages of MCC (stage I-II), the standard treat-\nment approach is WLE of the primary tumour.15,68 In T1-4\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage I-III)\nPrimary tumour management\nLN management\nSLN\npositive\nSLN\nnegative\nClinically negative LNs\nClinically positive LNs and in CUP\nNodal dissection and/or RT [III, B]\nAdjuvant RT ± nodal\ndissection [III, B]\nClinical trials with\n(neo)adjuvant systemic\ntherapy [III,A]\nClinical trials with (neo)adjuvant\nsystemic therapy [III,A]\nSLNB with immunopanel [III,A]\nOperable:\nWLE ± RT [IV, B]\nObservation\nDeﬁnitive RT [III, B]\nInoperable:\ndeﬁnitive RT [V, B]\nor\nanti-PD-1 therapya [III,A]\nRT (high risk of false-negative\nSLNB)b [IV, B]\nFigure 1.

In a review of\n29 studies that included patients with stage I-II MCC, no\nsigniﬁcant difference in regional recurrence rate was\ndemonstrated with versus without adjuvant RT (14.3%\nversus 4.6%, P ¼ 0.31).38 Furthermore, similar regional\nnodal recurrence and OS rates were reported in a cohort\nof 240 patients who underwent SLNB or elective LN\ndissection\nwithout\nprior\npathological\nnodal\nstaging\n(P ¼ 0.056).69 However, in selected clinical situations,\nthere is value in adjuvant regional RT. It is recommended\nin patients with profound immunosuppression, if SLNB is\nnot carried out or its accuracy is questionable [i.e.\nanatomic compromise, aberrant LN drainage or the pres-\nence of multiple sentinel LN (SLN) basins which is typical\nin head, neck or midline trunk MCC].70\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III)\nPatients with stage III MCC have a competing risk of sys-\ntemic recurrence. On the other hand, in elderly patients,\nsevere comorbidity may lead to increased risk for intra-/\npost-operative complications and higher morbidity related\nto local therapy. Each decision on adjuvant therapy should\nideally be made within the conﬁnes of an MDT. In this sit-\nuation, there is a recommendation to include patients in\nclinical trials for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy when\navailable.\nIn the presence of microscopic metastasis detected on\nSLNB or during node dissection [pathological stage IIIA: T1-\n4, N1a, N1a(sn), M0], adjuvant RT alone or in combination\nwith complete LN dissection (CLND) may be considered and\nrequires an individualised approach. In a prospective study,\n163 patients with SLN metastasis only underwent CLND or\nRT, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in survival\noutcomes (5-year OS: 71% versus 64%, P ¼ 1.0; DFS: 52%\nversus 61%, P ¼ 0.8; nodal RFS: 76% versus 91%, P ¼ 0.3 or\ndistant relapse-free survival: 65% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.3,\nrespectively). With sufﬁcient in-ﬁeld control of macroscopic\nMCC, in selected fragile patients who cannot tolerate nodal\nexcision under local anaesthesia, RT as monotherapy should\nbe considered.71 Another retrospective study of 447 pa-\ntients with MCC and a positive SLNB collected in the Na-\ntional Cancer Database showed that adjuvant RT \u0004 CLND\nled to a survival beneﬁt compared with CLND alone or\nobservation.72 Therefore, in younger patients (<75 years of\nage) with fewer comorbidities, a multidisciplinary approach\nwith adjuvant RT and CLND may be beneﬁcial. However, the\npotential beneﬁt may be decreased by the potential com-\nplications of CLND, such as lymphoedema, post-operative\nwound infection, skin necrosis and wound dehiscence,\nwhich is higher in the inguinal basin than in axillary\ndissection (26% versus 9%, respectively).73\nNo randomised trials have evaluated the efﬁcacy of\nadjuvant ChT or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with\nMCC. Therefore, adjuvant ChT is not routinely indicated. The\ndata supporting CRT are derived from a retrospective study\nof 4815 patients with head and neck MCC.74 In male pa-\ntients with positive margins and a tumour size of >3 cm,\npost-operative CRT and RT both provided a survival beneﬁt\ncompared with surgery alone (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81;\nHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92, respectively).74 In a study of\n6908 patients in the National Cancer Database, there was\nno beneﬁt (or detriment) of giving adjuvant ChT to patients\nwith high-risk disease.61 In this fragile population, the risk of\nserious side-effects is signiﬁcantly higher due to existing\ncomorbidities, and ChT-related mortality is between 4% and\n8%. There is also a concern about the immunosuppressive\neffects of ChT, which may lead to the development and\nprogression of MCC.75-77\nA limited number of published case reports and series\nhave addressed MCC of unknown primary (pathological\nstage IIIA: T0, N1b, M0). This group has a better outcome\nthan patients with known primary and synchronous nodal\nmetastases.12,42 The recommendation in this group is to\ncarry out a biopsy for pathological conﬁrmation of MCC,\nFDGePETeCT to rule out distant metastatic disease and\nmanagement of the nodal lesions similar to that proposed\nfor stage IIIB MCC.\nFor patients with clinically positive nodal disease (path-\nological stage IIIB, T1-4, N1b-3, M0), cross-sectional imaging\nis advised before surgery. There have been no prospective\ntrials evaluating the appropriate extent of CLND clearance\nfor MCC; in the absence of such evidence, it is recom-\nmended to follow the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline\n(CPG) for cutaneous melanoma.78 An analysis of the SEER\ndatabase incorporated propensity scoring and matched-pair\nanalysis and reported no difference in MCC-speciﬁc survival\nin patients who received RT after CLND versus observa-\ntion.79,80 In another study, Lewis et al. carried out a data-\nbase analysis encompassing 1254 patients and found\nreductions in local and regional recurrences with similar\nrates of distant metastases, but no statistical difference in\nterms of OS and MCC-speciﬁc survival.81 Therefore, patients\nwith node-positive MCC should be considered for clinical\ntrials with (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy because neither\nadjuvant RT nor ChT has been associated with a statistically\nsigniﬁcant impact on OS.61\nSatellite or in-transit metastases (pathological stage IIIB,\nT1-4, N2-3, M0) at post-operative histology are caused by\nthe cutaneous or subcutaneous intra-lymphatic spread. The\nfrequency is unclear but it is always associated with poor\nsurvival.42,82,83 In bulky, multiple and/or frequently recur-\nrent locoregional metastases, isolated limb perfusion may\nESMO Open\nI.

In a phase I-II study (CheckMate 358) of\nnivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting, surgical resection\nwas conducted after two doses of nivolumab 240 mg given\n2 weeks apart.85 Among the 36 patients who underwent\nsurgery, 17 had a conﬁrmed pathological CR (pCR) and 18\nhad a partial response (PR) by radiological assessment. At a\nmedian follow-up of 20 months, no patient with a pCR\nexperienced disease relapse. Additional studies are required\nto conﬁrm the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and the\nextent of surgery or post-operative RT in patients with a\npCR.85 In the adjuvant setting, although initial reports failed\nto show a therapeutic beneﬁt with ipilimumab as adjuvant\nmonotherapy, interim results from a prospective rando-\nmised study suggest a beneﬁt in terms of DFS for the pro-\ngrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab.\nHowever, ﬁnal results from prospective randomised trials\nare required to determine the true beneﬁts of adjuvant PD-\n(L)1 blockade.86\nRecommendations\n\u0003 An MDT meeting comprising experts with signiﬁcant\nMCC experience should be convened to diagnose and\nmake decisions about therapy; the preferred option is\nparticipation in clinical trials [III, A].\nManagement of local/locoregional disease (stage I-III)\n\u0003 After excisional biopsy, WLE with a margin of 1-2 cm\nis considered adequate; if a resection margin of\n1-2 cm is not technically achievable, a narrower\nmargin (0.5-1.0 cm) with adjuvant RT may also be\nacceptable [IV, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant RT with 50-60 Gy to the tumour bed is recom-\nmended for tumours of \u00051 cm in diameter and/or with\nnegative prognostic features (stage \u0005IB) [IV, A].\n\u0003 In patients at very low risk of locoregional recurrence\n(stage IA), clinical observation may be an alternative\nbut such a decision should only be made at referral cen-\ntres [V, A].\n\u0003 When WLE is not feasible, deﬁnitive RT of the primary\ntumour is an alternative approach [V, B].\nManagement of early-stage MCC (stage I-II; T1-4 N0 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 SLNB should be carried out during local surgical therapy\nof the primary tumour with special attention to drainage\npatterns [III, A].\n\u0003 In patients with a negative SLNB, observation is an op-\ntion, but in case of a risk of false negativity of SLNB or\nwhen SLNB is not carried out, adjuvant RT to the primary\nsite and nodal basin may be considered. This decision\nmust only be made at referral centres [IV, B].\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III; T1-4 N1-3 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 After a positive SLNB, adjuvant RT alone or in combina-\ntion with CLND is recommended after an MDT discussion\n[IV, B].\n\u0003 In clinically positive LNs, multiple nodal involvements or\nextra-nodal extension of the SLN, regional LN dissection\nwith post-operative RT is recommended (or deﬁnitive RT\nin inoperable patients) [III, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant ChT is not recommended [IV, D]; patients should\nbe considered for clinical trials with (neo)adjuvant sys-\ntemic therapy of modern immunotherapies [III, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE\nDespite the recent advances in diagnosis and treatment,\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC remain incurable. Admin-\nistration of immunotherapy in the ﬁrst-/second-line settings\nis recommended (if there is no contraindication for immu-\nnotherapy).87,88 ChT, palliative RT, best supportive care or\nparticipation in clinical trials should be considered based on\nthe clinical situation. In patients with recurrent oligometa-\nstatic and resectable disease, surgical removal or stereo-\ntactic irradiation of metastases can be considered if\nsystemic immunotherapy is contraindicated or the disease\nis refractory. A proposed algorithm for the management of\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC is shown in Figure 2.\nImmunotherapy\nPD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors are effective in the treatment\nof metastatic MCC.89 These drugs allow the reactivation of T\nlymphocytes and the triggering of the adaptive immune\nsystem by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 of the\ntumour\nmicroenvironment\nand\nPD-1\nexpressed\non\nlymphocyte surfaces. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 restores the\nantitumour activity of effector T cells and the function of\nexhausted T cells.89\nDespite their proven efﬁcacy, resistance to immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can occur due to different\nmechanisms: intrinsic resistance in patients who do not\nrespond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or acquired resistance in\npatients\nwhose\ntumours\nprogress\nafter\nthe\ninitial\nresponse.90-92 Open questions regarding the immunogenic\ncharacteristics\nof\nboth\nMCPyV-positive\nand\n-negative\nMerkel-cell tumours and the lack of predictive biomarkers\nof response to treatment are still under evaluation. Clinical\nbeneﬁt was not associated with any other biomarker eval-\nuated to date, such as PD-L1, MCPyV status, tumour\nmutational burden or CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltration.90-92\nImmunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab [ESMO-\nMagnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale (ESMO-MCBS) v1.1\nscore: 4; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Euro-\npean Medicines Agency (EMA) approved], pembrolizumab\n[ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA approved, not EMA\napproved], retifanlimab (FDA and approved) and nivolu-\nmab (not EMA or FDA approved), have shown high\nresponse rates both as ﬁrst- and second-line treatments,\nI.

Therefore,\nimmunotherapy is recommended in this setting if no\ncontraindications exist.\nThe ideal duration of ICI therapy is currently unknown.\nOne retrospective analysis of data collected at a single\ninstitute showed that among 65 patients treated with\navelumab, 25 had an FDGePETeCT-conﬁrmed CR. The 12-\nmonth RFS rate in these patients was 88% (95% CI 0.74-\n1.0). Reasons for stopping treatment included completion\nof 1 year of treatment (13 patients), toxicity (5 patients) and\npatient preference (7 patients).93 Prospective data from\nlarger patient cohorts and with longer follow-up are\ntherefore required to conﬁrm the ideal duration of ICI\ntherapy in patients with MCC.\nAvelumab. The efﬁcacy and safety of avelumab, an anti-PD-\nL1 inhibitor, were analysed in the JAVELIN Merkel 200 study,\nwhich was divided into parts A and B.94,95 Part A included\n88 patients with metastatic MCC who progressed after at\nleast one line of ChT. After >2 years of follow-up, the\nobjective response rate (ORR) was 33.0% (11.4% CR), me-\ndian duration of response (DoR) was 40.5 months and the\nDoR was >2 years in 67.0% of responders.90,94,95 In part B,\npatients who had not received prior systemic treatment for\nmetastatic disease were enrolled; the ORR was 39.7%\n(16.4% CR) with 30.2% having a response lasting >6\nmonths; the median OS was 20.3 months. First-line avelu-\nmab treatment was generally well-tolerated, and no\ntreatment-related deaths or grade 4 adverse events (AEs)\noccurred.\nIn\nthe\npretreated\npopulation,\ngrade\n3-4\ntreatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were observed in 11.4% of\npatients. From December 2015 to March 2019, 494 patients\nreceived avelumab as a ﬁrst- or second-line treatment for\nMCC within an expanded access programme (EAP); the ORR\nwas 46.7% (22.9% CR) and the disease control rate was\n71.2%. Avelumab was also associated with long-lasting\ndisease\ncontrol\nand\na\npositive\neffect\non\nOS.90,94,95\nEmerging real-world data suggest that outcomes with ave-\nlumab in clinical practice are in line with those seen in\nclinical trials.96 Recently published global data from EAPs\nand retrospective studies reported ORRs ranging from\n29.1% to 72.1% [CR 15.8%-37.2%; PR 18.2%-42.1% and\nstable disease (SD) 7.1%-30.9%], with median progression-\nfree survival (PFS) ranging from 8.1 to 24.1 months.\nImportantly, immunosuppressed patients also beneﬁted\nfrom avelumab, with response rates equivalent to the\ngeneral population. The best outcomes were achieved when\navelumab was given as ﬁrst-line therapy. The most common\nAEs were fatigue and infusion-related reactions; autoim-\nmune hepatitis and thyroiditis were also observed.97\nPembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab, a humanised immuno-\nglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that selectively\nbinds PD-1 on the surface of T lymphocytes, has been\ntested as a ﬁrst-line treatment in patients with MCC.98,99 In\na phase II clinical trial (KEYNOTE-017), 50 patients received\npembrolizumab for up to 2 years. TRAEs of any grade\noccurred in 49 of 50 patients (98%) and 15 patients (30%)\nhad grade \u00053 TRAEs with one death due to pericardial and\npleural effusion. The ORR was 58%, with 30% of patients\nachieving a CR. At 3 years, the PFS was 39.1% with a median\nPFS of 16.8 months; the 3-year OS rate was 59.4%, with a\nmedian OS not reached.99 Age, gender, baseline tumour\nburden, anatomic sites of metastasis and tumour PD-L1\nexpression and viral status expression did not correlate\nwith ORR, PFS or OS.98,99\nNivolumab.

In this\ntrial, retifanlimab treatment resulted in an ORR of 52% (95%\nCI 40% to 65%) in ChT-naive patients (N ¼ 65; CR 18% and\nPR 34%) with a median DoR between 1.1 months and >24.9\nmonths. Twenty-two\npercent\nof\npatients\nexperienced\nserious TRAEs, including fatigue, arrhythmia and pneumo-\nnitis, and 11% discontinued therapy due to AEs (the most\ncommon AEs were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus,\ndiarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and nausea).101\nChT\nAs there are no randomised trials in patients with MCC and\ndistant metastases, the impact of systemic ChT on survival is\nunclear. To date, available data are insufﬁcient to determine\nwhich of the different ChT regimens ensures the best PFS\nand OS in patients with metastatic MCC.\nChT regimens that have been used to treat patients with\nMCC include taxanes, topotecan, a combination of etopo-\nsideecisplatin, etoposideecarboplatin or cyclophosphamidee\ndoxorubicinevincristine.102 Response rates ranged from 20%\nto 75%, with higher response rates in the ﬁrst-line setting\n(53%-61%) versus the second-line setting (23%-45%); among\nresponders, the median DoRs were w2-9 months.76,103,104\nUnfortunately, in this fragile, elderly population, the occur-\nrence of toxic deaths limits ChT usage; toxic deaths were\nobserved in 3%-10% of patients.76,103,104 However, ChT might\nbe proposed after failure on immunotherapy or when\nimmunotherapy is contraindicated.\nTargeted therapies\nIn the UKMCC-01 trial, the efﬁcacy of pazopanib was\nassessed in 16 patients with MCC and a median age of 73\nyears (range 56-90 years).105 A clinical beneﬁt was reported\nin nine patients (three had a PR and six had SD) with a\nmedian duration of 8.0 weeks (range 1.3-38.4 weeks). The\ntrial was stopped due to slow accrual.105 A lack of activity\nand limited tolerance were also shown in a phase II trial\nwith cabozantinib in patients with recurrent/metastatic\nMCC after platinum failure.106 Based on published results,\nthe use of targeted therapy is not recommended.\nWith regard to radioligand therapy, although MCC\nfrequently\nexpresses\nsomatostatin\nreceptors,\nGa68-\nDOTATOC and Lu177-DOTATATE have only been studied\nin a few patients and further clinical trials are needed to\ndetermine their role in MCC.102,107 As such, they should not\ncurrently be considered as a standard of care.\nPalliative RT\nPalliative RT has mainly been assessed retrospectively. In a\nstudy applying an 8-Gy single fraction, a CR with almost 80%\nof in-ﬁeld lesion control was documented in 45% of pa-\ntients.87 Another study comparing 8 Gy as a single or\nmultiple fractions (3 \u0006 8 Gy) documented a CR in 10%\nversus 48% and a recurrence rate of 41% versus 5% (P ¼\n0.04), respectively.108 Patients of poor performance status\nshould be considered for a lower dose hypofractionation\nschedule (e.g. 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions),\nwhich can still achieve tumour regression.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Patients should receive individualised multimodality\ntreatment in referral centres for rare skin cancers with\naccess to clinical trials [III, B].\n\u0003 In oligometastatic disease progression, surgical removal\nor stereotactic irradiation of operable locoregional recur-\nrence or a single distant metastasis should be considered\nin ﬁt patients, although systemic immunotherapy should\nbe considered as the ﬁrst step [V, B].\n\u0003 Immunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab (III, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4; FDA and EMA approved),\npembrolizumab (III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA\napproved, not EMA approved), retifanlimab (III, A; FDA\nand EMA approved) and nivolumab (III, A; not EMA or\nFDA approved), are recommended as ﬁrst- and second-\nline treatments if no contraindications exist.\n\u0003 In cases of inoperable/disseminated disease, ﬁrst-line\ntreatment with an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody is suggested\nas it is more effective and safer than ChT [II, B].\n\u0003 In patients with contraindications or after failure of\nimmunotherapy, palliative RT and/or ChT may be op-\ntions, but their impact on OS is uncertain [III, B].\nPOPULATIONS OF SPECIAL CONSIDERATION\nSince MCC is present mainly in elderly patients, use of\ngeriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity assessments\nare important for decision making to achieve disease con-\ntrol and assure an acceptable quality of life. For patients\nwho are not medical candidates for surgery, RT alone may\nbe considered. However, in patients with inoperable/met-\nastatic disease, given the relatively good tolerability of ICIs,\nthese agents are the preferred choice of systemic therapy\nfor this subset of patients.\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n9\n\n---\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Use of geriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity as-\nsessments are important for decision making [V, A].\n\u0003 RT alone may be considered in patients not suitable for\nsurgery [IV, A].\n\u0003 In elderly patients with inoperable/metastatic disease,\nICIs are the preferred choice of systemic therapy [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nAfter primary surgical excision, local recurrence develops in\n27%-60% of patients, regional nodal involvement is reported\nin 45%-91% of patients and distant metastases are found in\n18%-52%.42,109,110 Risk factors for recurrence include immu-\nnosuppression, advancing age, advancing stage of disease\n(stage II-IV), individuals assigned male at birth, non-SLN\nmetastases, MCPyV-negative status, as well as additional\nfactors as determined by the treating physicians. No formal\nclinical\ntrials\nhave\nevaluated\nthe\noptimal\nsurveillance\nschedule in MCC, either in terms of frequency or type of\ndiagnostic examinations. As the risk of relapse is higher in the\nﬁrst 2-3 years after initial treatment (40%-50% nodal and 33%\ndistant metastases),15 more intense follow-up should be\napplied in this period. Follow-up examinations are recom-\nmended every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, and then\nevery 6 months until year 5. After 5 years of observation, a\ngeneral physical examination is recommended every 12\nmonths lifelong, including a complete skin check-up. Physical\nexamination should include total-body skin examination and\nLN assessment with particular attention to the scar region,\nincluding the primary site, in-transit region and regional LN\nbasin. Distant metastases may develop in a wide range of\nanatomical locations; thus, routine cross-sectional imaging\nmay be proposed in higher-risk patients.\nThe radiological examination may be either a diagnostic CT\nof the thorax/abdomen/pelvis (and head/neck for patients\nwith head and neck primaries) or whole-body PETeCT, un-\ndertaken every 6-12 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, with ul-\ntrasound scans used for local LN assessment. After year 3,\nimaging studies should be carried out as clinically indicated.\nPatients with MCC have a higher risk for developing another\nskin cancer9,15,39,111,112; therefore, education regarding self-\nexamination of the whole skin surface is valuable. The role\nof MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncertain but it\nmay be utilised in patients who are seropositive at base-\nline.50,113,114 The early detection of a locoregional relapse\nmay be cured by surgery. However, inoperable/metastatic\nrelapse should be treated as metastatic disease, as described\nin the previous section.115-117 Therapy should be coordinated\nby an MDT at the referral centre.87,118,119\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Follow-up examinations are recommended in radically\ntreated patients every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years,\nand then every 6 months up to year 5. After 5 years of\nobservation,\na\ngeneral\nphysical\nexamination\nis\nrecommended every 12 months lifelong, including a\ncomplete skin check-up [IV, A].\n\u0003 Patient education regarding self-examination of the\nwhole skin is valuable as patients with MCC have a\nhigher risk of developing another skin cancer [IV, A].\n\u0003 The role of MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncer-\ntain, but it may be utilised in patients who are seropos-\nitive at baseline [V, A].\n\u0003 Routine cross-sectional imaging may be proposed in\nhigher-risk patients [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG has been developed by ESMO in partnership with\nEURACAN, in accordance with the ESMO standard operating\nprocedures for CPG development (http://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-GuidelinesMethodology).\nThe\nrelevant\nliterature has been selected by the expert authors. The\nguideline is conceived to provide a standard approach to\ndiagnosis, treatment and survivorship of MCC. Due to the\nrarity of MCC incidence, prospective and randomised\nstudies are limited; therefore, the basis of this guideline was\nmainly\ndata\nfrom\nretrospective,\nobservational\ncohort\nstudies, both institutional and cancer registry-based, often\nwith heterogeneous results. These studies have many limi-\ntations, such as selection bias, confounding factors, limited\nand missing data and lack of randomisation. Recommended\ninterventions are intended to correspond to the ‘standard’\napproaches according to current consensus among the Eu-\nropean multidisciplinary MCC community of experts. These\nare represented by the members of the ESMO Melanoma\nFaculty and experts appointed by all institutions belonging\nto the Rare Skin Cancer domain of EURACAN. Experimental\ninterventions considered to be beneﬁcial are labelled as\n‘investigational’. Other non-standard approaches may be\nproposed to the single patient as ‘options’ for a shared\npatientephysician decision in conditions of uncertainty as\nlong as some supporting evidence (though not conclusive) is\navailable. Algorithms accompany the text, covering the\nmain typical presentations of disease, and are meant to\nguide the user throughout the text. An ESMO-MCBS table\nwith ESMO-MCBS scores is included in Supplementary\nTable S5, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.102977. ESMO-MCBS v1.1120 was used to calculate\nscores for new therapies/indications approved by the EMA\nand/or the FDA (https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-\nMCBS). The scores have been calculated and validated by\nthe ESMO-MCBS Working Group and reviewed by the au-\nthors.

The pri-\nmary tumour site for NENs remains unidentiﬁed in 13%-20%\nof cases.1 NENs account for w8% of unknown primary\n(UKP) malignancies and UKP-NENs represent the fourth\nmost common NEN with an increasing incidence of 8.4 per\nmillion, representing 10%-15% of NETs and NECs.1,2\nGenitourinary and gynaecological (GUGy)-NENs account\nfor 1%-2% of GUGy malignancies, 12% of NECs and 4% of\nNETs.3 Their estimated incidence in Europe is 0.5-1 per\nmillion.4 GUGy-NENs arise from the bladder, kidney, ureter,\novary, cervix, endometrium, prostate, testis or presacral\nspace5-7 (see Section 1 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.1036\n64).\nNENs arising from the head and neck (HN) account for\n<1% of HN malignancies, 2% of NECs and 0.6% of NETs.4\nTheir estimated incidence in Europe is 0.1-0.15 per\nmillion.4 HN-NENs arise most frequently from the larynx8\nfollowed by the middle ear9 and sinonasal tract10 (see\nSection 1 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nDiagnosis and pathological classiﬁcation\nPathological classiﬁcation.

The objective of the initial diagnostic\nwork-up of UKP-NENs is to identify the occult primary\ntumour. Metastatic patterns can be indicative of primary\ntumour location. The most common site for the occult pri-\nmary is the ileum followed by the pancreas.16 Ileal NETs\noften present as a mesenteric mass on computed tomog-\nraphy (CT).16 Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging (SRI)\nwith\ngallium-68-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-\ntetraacetic acid-labelled somatostatin analogue ([68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSA)epositron emission tomography (PET)eCT is the\nmost sensitive technique for NETs, detecting an occult pri-\nmary in 61% of cases.17 If SRI is uninformative, [18F]\nF-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)ePETeCT and endoscopy\ntechniques can be useful (see Supplementary Table S1,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664, and Section 3 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664).\nFor\nNECs,\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose\n(FDG)ePETeCT may be used. The presence of secretory\nsyndromes and elevated hormone levels may also facilitate\nidentiﬁcation of the primary NET. A minimum panel of\npeptide\nhormones\nshould\nbe\nmeasured\nin\npatients\nwith\nUKP-NETs\n[calcitonin,\nmetanephrines\nand\n5-\nhydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)]. Other hormones may\nbe measured depending on symptoms (see Supplementary\nTable S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664,\nand\nSection\n3\nof\nthe\nSupplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664). Chromogranin A has demonstrated a sensi-\ntivity of 71% and speciﬁcity of 84%-85% for the detection of\ngastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs.18\nIt is important to distinguish between primary GUGy-\nNETs and metastasis in the GUGy system from primary tu-\nmours in another site. Indeed, ovarian, testicular and renal\nmetastases occur in patients with GEP or lung NETs.\nSymptoms result from local inﬁltration in patients with\nmore aggressive GUGy-NENs and performance status (PS)\ndeterioration. Less than 15% of GUGy-NETs present with\nhormone-related symptoms (mostly carcinoid syndrome).1\nHN-NENs induce non-speciﬁc symptoms such as hoarse-\nness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, nasal obstruction, epistaxis and\nconductive hearing loss.19,20 Laryngeal NENs arise from the\nsupraglottic region in 85% of cases.8 Middle-ear NENs appear\nas a retrotympanic mass extending into the ossicles, mastoid,\nauditory canal and Eustachian tube.9,19 Sinonasal NENs occur\nin the ethmoid (64% of cases), nasal cavity (32%) and maxil-\nlary sinus (14%). The most common metastatic sites are the\nlymph nodes, lungs, liver and bones.21 Skin metastases can be\nextremely painful and suggestive of laryngeal NETs.22 Func-\ntional syndromes are rare and include carcinoid syndrome,\nsyndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hor-\nmone, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome and\nLamberteEaton myasthenic syndrome.23\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients\nwith UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs should be discussed in a\nNEN multidisciplinary tumour board (MTB) [V, A].\n\u0003 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs should be classiﬁed and\ngraded according to the common IARCeWHO 2018\nconsensus classiﬁcation together with the organ-speciﬁc\nWHO classiﬁcation [V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, IHC should be carried out to exclude para-\ngangliomas (cytokeratin) and to identify the primary [as a\nminimum: thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and\ncaudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX-2)]. Calcitonin, serotonin\nand other IHC markers may be used [IV, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, secretory syn-\ndromes should be diagnosed based on hormone-related\nsymptoms. As a minimum, metanephrines, 5-HIAA and\ncalcitonin should be measured in those with UKP-NETs\n[V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, cross-sectional imaging may identify meta-\nstatic patterns suggestive of a primary site (e.g. a mesen-\nteric mass indicative of an ileal NET) [IV, A].

FDGePETeCT may be helpful\nin NENs with a higher proliferation index (G3 NETs\nand NECs) [V, B]. [18F]F-DOPAePETeCT may also detect\nan ileum primary, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma\nin patients with UKP-NETs [V, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-NECs, searches for the primary\nshould not delay treatment intervention, apart from cuta-\nneous examination for Merkel-cell carcinoma and IHC for\ncytokeratin 20 and Merkel-cell polyomavirus, if available\n[V, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nAdequate staging of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs relies on\ncross-sectional imaging and nuclear medicine techniques.\nCT scans are effective for the detection of lung metastases\nwhereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is better for\nliver and bone metastases. MRI is also preferred in young\npatients as radiation exposure is lower. SRI has a high\nsensitivity for NETs and should be part of the initial work-\nup. SSTR scintigraphy is less sensitive and should only be\ncarried out when SRIePETeCT is not available. Whole body\nCT, or FDGePETeCT in case of limited tumour burden, are\nrecommended for the staging of G2-3 NETs and NECs.24\nStaging of middle-ear HN-NENs is based on the system\nproposed by Marinelli et al.19 while staging of GUGy- and\nHN-NENs is based on the eighth edition of the Union for\nInternational Cancer Control (UICC) TNM (tumourenodee\nmetastasis) classiﬁcation25 (see Supplementary Tables S2-\nS10, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). There is no staging classiﬁcation for UKP-NENs\nunless an occult primary is identiﬁed by the initial diag-\nnostic work-up.\nPrognosis for all NENs relies on pathological grading and\nstaging. In patients with metastases, differentiation, WHO\ngrade, age, PS, tumour burden, SRI and/or FDG uptake, the\npresence of a functional syndrome at baseline and tumour\ngrowth rate should be considered for optimal risk assessment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 CT and/or MRI are recommended for staging. MRI should\nbe mainly considered in young patients to reduce irradi-\nation anddusing late arterial phase imagingdimprove\ndetection of hepatic, pancreatic, brain and bone NETs\n[III, A].\n\u0003 SRIePET is recommended for initial and preoperative\nstaging, and when indicated for restaging [V, A].\n\u0003 FDGePETeCT can be used for staging G2-3 NETs and\nNECs [IV, B].\n\u0003 Major independent prognostic factors are disease stage\n(TNM) and pathological features including differentiation\nand WHO grade [IV, A]. Age, PS, tumour burden, the pres-\nence of functional syndromes and tumour growth rate\nare additional prognostic factors [IV, B].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nPatients with UKP-NENs may present with lymph node\nmetastases without the detection of a primary tumour or\ndistant metastases. For G1-3 UKP-NETs, radical resection of\nlocoregional\ndisease\nis the\npreferred\ntreatment\n(see\nFigure 1). While searching for an occult primary, the site of\nlymph node metastasis may guide surgical exploration (e.g.\nan involved mesenteric node is suggestive of an ileal pri-\nmary). There is no evidence to support adjuvant therapy\nfollowing curative resection of NETs. For UKP-NECs, down-\nstaging of locoregional disease with chemotherapy (ChT)\nand/or radiotherapy (RT) may be considered before surgery.\nSome patients with NECs, particularly with isolated inguinal\nor neck nodes, may have prolonged disease control and\nsurvival following multimodal treatment including sur-\ngery.26 In this setting, Merkel-cell carcinoma should be ruled\nout. It is unclear whether post-operative treatment of NECs\nimproves\noutcomes,\nbut\nfour cycles of carboplatine\netoposide may be considered, particularly if neoadjuvant\nChT has not been used.27\nThere are no prospective data on the management of\nlocal and locoregional disease in patients with GUGy-NENs.\nRecommendations are therefore extrapolated from site-\nspeciﬁc ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs).28 For\nGUGy-NETs,\nupfront\nradical\nsurgery\nwithout\nadjuvant\ntreatment is recommended when feasible (see Figure 2);\nhowever, a conservative surgical approach should be dis-\ncussed whenever possible, particularly for low-grade local-\nised NETs. The role of adjuvant therapy for G3 GUGy-NETs is\nalso unknown. For GUGy-NECs, multimodal therapy should\nalways be discussed for localised disease. Further details\nregarding the management of local and locoregional GUGy-\nNENs are available in Section 4 of the Supplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664.\nFor HN-NENs, locoregional treatment depends on the\nprimary site (see Figure 3). In the larynx, NETs are mainly\nsupraglottic and their sensitivity to ChT and RT may be low.\nBased\non\nretrospective\ndata,\nradical\nresection\nafter\ncompletion of whole body imaging (including PETeCT) is\nrecommended whenever possible with homolateral neck\ndissection, as it may lower the risk of regional lymph node\nrecurrence.8 Post-operative RT should be discussed in a\nmultidisciplinary meeting, particularly for G2 NETs.8 For\nlaryngeal NECs, treatment relies mainly on ChT and RT8;\nsurgery may be discussed in selected cases.29 For sinonasal\nNETs, surgery was associated with longer survival in retro-\nspective series.30,31 The role of prophylactic neck dissection\nis unknown. Post-operative RT should be discussed but\nthere is no evidence that it prevents locoregional relapse.\nFor sinonasal NECs, treatment should be multimodal.\nRetrospective data suggest that induction ChT is beneﬁ-\ncial,10 in combination with RT in most cases and surgery in\nselected cases.21,31 Most middle-ear tumours are NETs.\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment,19,32 but complete\nresection with no tumour at the margin (R0) is challenging\nand there is a risk of locoregional relapse when ossicles are\nJ. Hadoux et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\n3\n\n---\ninvolved. There are no data on post-operative RT; however,\nRT may be discussed for patients with a higher risk of\nrelapse due to adherence to important neurovascular\nstructures. RT might prevent extension to the skull base and\nsubsequent\ndebilitating\ncomplications.\nThis\nmust\nbe\nbalanced against the risk of long-term RT-induced toxicity.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-NETs with locoregional disease, the\naim of surgical resection with exploration is to identify\nand treat the primary tumour with microscopic radical\nintent [V, A].\n\u0003 For GUGy-NETs, surgery of the primary tumour and nodes\nwith microscopic radical intent (according to site-speciﬁc\nESMO CPGs) is the treatment of choice for local and\nlocoregional disease, irrespective of grade [V, A]. A con-\nservative surgical approach should be discussed when-\never feasible, particularly in low-grade, early-stage NETs\n[V, B].\n\u0003 For laryngeal and sinonasal NETs, surgery of the primary\ntumour with microscopic radical intent and homolateral\ntherapeutic neck dissection is recommended whenever\npossible [IV, A].\n\u0003 Adjuvant treatment cannot be recommended for UKP-\nNETs [V, D] but adjuvant RT may be discussed for GUGy-\nNETs in patients with microscopic (R1) or macroscopic\n(R2) tumour at the margin and/or G3 disease [V, C].\n\u0003 For HN-NETs, adjuvant RT may be discussed after radical\nresection, particularly in case of locoregional spread,\nnon-R0 resection and G2 disease; however, the beneﬁt\nin terms of local control is unknown [V, C].\n\u0003 For locoregional sinonasal NECs, neoadjuvant ChT with\nplatinumeetoposide may be considered before surgical\nresection [IV, C].\n\u0003 For NECs treated with radical surgery, adjuvant therapy\nwith four cycles of platinumeetoposide may be consid-\nered [V, B].\n\u0003 Neoadjuvant ChT may be an option for UKP- and GUGy-\nNECs [V, C].\n\u0003 Combining RT with ChT is recommended for HN-NECs [IV,\nA] and could be discussed for UKP- and GUGy-NECs as\ndeﬁnitive or (neo)adjuvant treatment [V, C].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nFor UKP-NETs there are few clinical trials with low patient\nnumbers and for UKP-NECs there are only retrospective\nFigure 1.

For advanced or metastatic\nGUGy- and HN-NENs, neither retrospective nor prospective\nstudies are available. Thus, recommendations for the man-\nagement of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs are based on the\nmanagement of NENs of GEP or lung origin and so systemic\ntreatments approved for GEP-NETs are used off-label in this\nsetting.28 When an occult primary is identiﬁed or suspected\n(such as a mesenteric mass from an ileal NET), its man-\nagement should follow the dedicated guideline.\nTreatment decisions (see Figure 4) should be based on\ncomprehensive multidisciplinary characterisation of the\ntumour (see ‘Staging and risk assessment’). In particular,\nWHO grade, differentiation (well versus poor),33 SSTR status\nbased on SRIePETeCT24 and presence of a functional syn-\ndrome should be considered.\nSurgery and locoregional therapies. Surgery should be\ndiscussed\nfor\nslowly\nproliferating\n(oligo)metastatic\ntumours in patients with G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs;\nthis includes surgical exploration for occult primary\nidentiﬁcation in case of UKP-NETs.34 Metastatic spread in\nHN-NETs frequently involves the skin, particularly in those\narising from the larynx.20,22 Skin metastases are usually\nmultiple and small in size, causing hard-to-treat pain and\ndiscomfort, which affects patients’ quality of life. In most\ncases, they are resistant to systemic treatment. Repeated\nlocoregional therapies may be used, including surgical\nresection, electrochemotherapy35 and RT for the largest\ntumours.22\nSomatostatin analogues. Two phase III trials [CLARINET\n(lanreotide) and PROMID (octreotide)] have reported longer\nprogression-free survival (PFS) or time to progression with\nsomatostatin analogue (SSA) treatment compared with\nplacebo in patients with metastatic GEP-NETs. Both studies\nincluded some patients with UKP-NETs but none with GUGy-\nor HN-NETs.36,37 Extrapolating the results from CLARINET\nand PROMID, SSAs may be recommended for tumour\nFigure 2.

Based on data from the RADIANT-2,42\nRADIANT-343 and RADIANT-444 trials (NETs of various pri-\nmaries), everolimus monotherapy may be considered as\nﬁrst-line treatment for SSTR-negative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and\nHN-NETs, or as second-line treatment after SSAs in patients\nwith progressive disease. The RADIANT studies, however,\nincluded only 36 patients with UKP-NETs and no patients\nwith GUGy- or HN-NETs. Based on the randomised CABI-\nNET,45 AXINET46 and SANET-ep47 trials, antiangiogenic\nmultikinase inhibitors (MKIs) may be considered as alter-\nnatives to everolimus for ﬁrst-line treatment of SSTR-\nnegative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NETs, or for second-\nline treatment after SSAs in patients with progressive dis-\nease. These studies included 34-49 patients with UKP-NETs\nor NETs of other origin not otherwise speciﬁed (see Sec-\ntion 5 of the Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nChT. In patients with progressive G2 (Ki-67 >10%) and G3\nNETs, alkylating agent-based and oxaliplatin-based ChT\nregimens may be considered. Most data for management of\nG3 NETs with these regimens are from patients with\npancreatic NETs, with response rates of up to 30% and\nmedian PFS of 8-16 months.48 Loss of O-6-methylguanine-\nDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression or promoter\nhypermethylation may prompt use of alkylating agent-\nbased ChT (see Section 5 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664).49,50 For the management of NECs, ﬁrst-line\ncarboplatineetoposide or cisplatineetoposide is recom-\nmended based on retrospective series showing response\nrates of 40%-60%, median PFS of 4-6 months and median\noverall survival (OS) of 12 months.2,10,21,29,51 Carboplatine\netoposide or cisplatineetoposide should not be used for\nwell-differentiated NETs, regardless of grade.33,51\nFigure 3.

With the exception\nof UKP-NENs (see Section 6 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664),\nthere are no data on long-term follow-up. Follow-up carries\nthe risk of excessive radiation exposure, so low-dose CT (for\nlung metastases) or MRI should be used whenever possible,\nespecially in patients for whom prolonged follow-up is\nanticipated. There is a consensus for the use of molecular\nimaging for SSTR-positive NETs, especially SRI with [68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSAePETeCT, at initial staging and for post-surgical\nrestaging, but not for routine follow-up.24 Molecular imag-\ning may play a role, however, in the follow-up of secondary\nlesions that are hard to evaluate with conventional imaging,\nsuch as peritoneal carcinomatosis and bone metastases.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected G1 and low G2 (Ki-\n67 <10%) UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-\ndose CT or MRI is recommended every 6 months for\n2 years, annually for years 3-5 and every second year\nthereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected G2 (Ki-67 \u000510%)\nand G3 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-\ndose CT or MRI is recommended every 3 months for\n2 years, every 6 months in year 3, annually for years\n4-5 and every second year thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or\nHN-NECs,\nfollow-up\nshould\nbe\ncarried\nout\nevery\n2-3 months for 2 years, every 6 months in year 3 and\nthen discussed on a case-by-case basis thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or HN-\nNENs, the best molecular imaging technique (according to\nSRIePET and/or FDGePETeCT positivity at initial staging)\nis recommended 6 months after resection and then in\ncase of unclear or abnormal imaging results [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual\nor metastatic disease, restaging is recommended every\n4-6 months [G1 and low G2 (Ki-67 <10%) NETs] or every\n3-4 months [G2 (Ki-67 \u000510%) and G3 NETs]; the interval\ncan be increased in case of stable disease [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual or\nmetastatic disease, systematic follow-up using PET imaging\nis not recommended but may be considered in case of\ndoubtful or abnormal imaging results, increasing bio-\nmarkers, clinical suspicion of new metastasis (particularly\nin the bone) and/or depending on the metastatic sites\nand their measurability using conventional imaging, espe-\ncially when locoregional therapies are discussed [V, C].\n\u0003 Patientswithdisseminateddiseasemaybeneﬁtfromreferral\nto specialised palliative care units for appropriate pain treat-\nment, psychosocial support and rehabilitation [II, B].\nPARATHYROID CARCINOMA\nIncidence and epidemiology\nParathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare neoplasm, accounting\nfor <1% of primary hyperparathyroidism cases.56 PC affects\nmale and female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of\n50 years. PC occurs as a sporadic form, or less frequently as\nfamilial forms such as hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour\nsyndrome (HPT-JT; w15% of cases) linked to a germline\nmutation in the CDC73/HRPT2 gene.57 Rarely, it can occur as\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 (MEN1) or type\n2A (MEN2A).58 Even in the absence of a family history,\n20%-40% of patients with apparently sporadic PC have a\ngermline CDC73 mutation.58,59\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nDiagnosis.\nClinical presentation. PC can be suspected in patients\nwho present with severe primary hyperparathyroidism\ncharacterised by severe hypercalcaemia-related symptoms\nand markedly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.\nLess than 10% of patients have normal serum calcium and\nPTH levels and present with a non-functional PC with only\nlocal symptoms, such as a palpable cervical mass, hoarse-\nness, dysphagia or dyspnoea.60\nLaboratory studies. Most patients with PC have markedly\nhigh levels of calcium (>14 mg/dl or 3.5 mmol/l) and non-\nsuppressed intact PTH 1-84 molecule (3-10 times above the\nupper limit of normal). The combined presence of high\nserum calcium (>3 mmol/l) and a parathyroid lesion >3 cm\n(the so-called ‘>3, >3 rule’), should raise suspicion of PC.\nSome patients with PC may overproduce N-terminal PTH\nfragment and have elevated serum and urinary levels of\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin; their determination could\nbe useful for differential diagnosis with benign adenoma,\nalthough this has only been tested in a small series.61\nImaging. Neck US is the ﬁrst-line imaging technique for\nthe diagnosis of parathyroid lesions. Its sensitivity varies\nfrom 67% to 96% with a positive predictive value of 89.7%-\n97%62; however, there are no speciﬁc patterns of malig-\nnancy (see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with cytology and\nwashout PTH measurement can help to differentiate from\nlesions of other origins (e.g. thyroid, distant metastases\nfrom other tumours).63 Complications associated with the\nFNA procedure (including occasional seeding) are rare.64\nContrast-enhanced CT and MRI can be used in highly\nsuspicious cases to evaluate inﬁltration of surrounding tissue\nbut are not routinely carried out for differential diagnosis.65\nParathyroid\nscintigraphy\nwith\n[99mTc]Tc-sesta-methox-\nyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) single-photon emission CT (SPECT)\nor SPECTeCT, in combination with neck US, is the procedure\nof choice for preoperative identiﬁcation of hyperfunctioning\nparathyroids. During initial PC evaluation, the sensitivity and\ndiagnostic accuracy of [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI scintigraphy are\nJ. Hadoux et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\n9\n\n---\n\u000580% when used with neck US or CT. Nevertheless, there are\nno clear scintigraphic parameters that allow a real preoper-\native differential diagnosis between PC and adenoma.\nPET procedures such as [11C]-methionineePETeCT and\n[18F]-cholineePETeCT are effective for the diagnosis of pri-\nmary hyperparathyroidism but their added value in the dif-\nferential diagnosis between PC and adenoma is unknown.66\nPathology. Histological diagnosis of PC is based on the 2022\nWHO classiﬁcation criteria: (i) vascular invasion; (ii) lymphatic\ninvasion; (iii) perineural (intraneural) invasion; (iv) local ma-\nlignant invasion into adjacent anatomical structures; or (v)\nhistologically or cytologically documented metastatic disease.\nThe morphology of PC is usually reminiscent of parathyroid\nadenoma or hyperplasia.67,68 Features suggestive of malig-\nnancy and warranting a diagnosis of atypical adenoma [also\ncalled parathyroid neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential\nor atypical parathyroid tumour (APT)] are macroscopically\nevident necrosis, size >3 cm, weight >500 mg, mitotic index\n>5 mitoses/2 mm2 and the presence of atypical mitosis67,69\n(see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Some rare\nvariants have been described, including oncocytic carcinomas\nand carcinosarcomas with more aggressive behaviour.70,71\nAlthough PC generally shows a higher proliferation index\n(Ki-67 6%-9% compared with <4% in adenoma), there is no\npredeﬁned Ki-67 cut-off to support or exclude a PC diagnosis.\nThe International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)\nhas issued a dataset on PC and APT that covers PC grading,\nconsidering it high grade in the presence of sheets of pleo-\nmorphic enlarged nuclei, coagulative necrosis, abnormal\nmitosis and/or increased proliferation rate.69\nMolecular biology. The most frequent molecular alteration\nin PC is on the CDC73 gene (40%-50% of cases). Phospha-\ntidylinositol-3-kinase\n(PI3K)eprotein\nkinase\nb\n(AKT)e\nmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the most\nfrequently altered pathway (40%-80% of cases).65,72,73 IHC\nevaluation of paraﬁbromin loss of expression to identify a\ndouble-hit inactivation of the CDC73 gene is a recognised\nancillary diagnostic method for malignancy, as is evaluation\nof loss of p27, other types of cyclins or cell cycle regulators,\ngalectin-3 and protein gene product 9.5.69,74\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Genetic testing for germline CDC73 mutation should be\ncarried out to rule out HPT-JT in all patients with PC,\nincluding those without a family history [IV, A].\n\u0003 The combined presence of markedly elevated serum cal-\ncium [>12 mg/dl (>3 mmol/l)] and parathyroid lesions\n>3 cm should raise suspicion of PC [IV, B].\n\u0003 US of the neck should be carried out to assess lesions sus-\npicious for PC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are used to evaluate\nlocoregional invasion before planning surgery [V, A].\n\u0003 FNA cytology and washout PTH measurements can be\nused to differentiate PC from other neck or thyroid nod-\nules but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [V, C].\n\u0003 [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBIeSPECT may be useful for the diag-\nnosis of PC but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [IV, C].\n\u0003 PC pathology reporting should follow the 2022 WHO clas-\nsiﬁcation (ﬁfth edition) and ICCR template [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe prognosis for patients with PC is variable, with 5- and 10-\nyear OS rates after surgery of w80% and 40%-80%, respec-\ntively. Good prognosis is associated with early diagnosis and\nradicality of initial surgery, whereas poor prognosis is mainly\nrelated to older age and the presence of lymph node me-\ntastases.75-79\nStaging is based on the eighth edition of the American\nJoint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system (see\nSupplementary Table S11, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).80 Only 15%-30% of patients\nhave level VI lymph node metastases and one-third have\ndistant metastases, most commonly in the lung, liver or\nbone. The detection of locoregional or distant metastases is\nbased on neck US, thoracic and abdominal CT, or MRI.\nAmong nuclear medicine techniques, total body acquisi-\ntion with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI can identify possible extra-\ncervical uptake and unexpected lesions. FDGePETeCT can\nalso be applied as PC generally shows high FDG uptake. It\ncan be used to complement conventional imaging in the\ninitial staging and for residual or relapsing disease, albeit\nbased on limited data.81 Other PET tracers such as [11C]-\nmethionineePETeCT and [18F]-cholineePETeCT have not\nbeen validated for routine staging of PC.66,81,82\nRecommendations\n\u0003 PC staging should follow the eighth edition of the AJCC\nTNM system [IV, A].\n\u0003 Cross-sectional imaging is the reference method [V, A] but\nadditional FDGePETeCT may improve staging accuracy\n[IV, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nManagement of hypercalcaemia. Medical management of\nhypercalcaemia is the main treatment for patients awaiting\nsurgery and those with inoperable PC. Cinacalcet, a potent\nsecond-generation calcium mimetic, is effective for con-\ntrolling hypercalcaemia in patients with inoperable or\npersistent disease.83,84 The greatest reductions in calcium\nwere reported in patients with the highest serum calcium\nlevels before therapy. The cornerstones of treatment for\nsevere or symptomatic hypercalcaemia are intravenous sa-\nline hydration and bisphosphonate administration (see\nSection 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nSurgery. Surgery is the recommended ﬁrst-line treatment\nfor PC (Figure 6).85 Inadequate and non-radical surgery\nrepresent the strongest prognostic factors for recurrence\nand mortality. In case of high suspicion of PC, en bloc\nremoval of the parathyroid lesion avoiding capsule rupture\nand local seeding, homolateral thyroid lobo-isthmectomy\nand central node dissection are recommended.86\nESMO Open\nJ.

Analysis of data from the National Cancer Database\nidentiﬁed 885 patients with PC who underwent surgery\nbetween 2004 and 2016, including 126 (14.2%) who also\nreceived external beam RT. The latter group had a higher\nfrequency of extensive regional disease, nodal metastases\nand residual microscopic disease. The 5-year OS rate was\n85.3% with a median follow-up of 60.8 months. RT was not\nassociated with a difference in OS based on multivariate\nanalysis87; however, small series from highly specialised\ntertiary centres have reported lower locoregional relapse\nrates in patients undergoing adjuvant RT,88-90 particularly in\npatients with R1 or R2 resection.90 Although not recom-\nmended for all patients, adjuvant RT should be discussed in\nthe case of R1 or R2 resection and/or lymph node metas-\ntasis (Nþ) and/or persistent hypercalcaemia.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Medical treatment of hypercalcaemia is required before\nsurgery [V, A].\n\u0003 Cinacalcet is recommended to control hypercalcaemia [II,\nA].\n\u0003 Hydration with saline infusion, at a starting dose of 200-\n500 ml/h, is the ﬁrst step in the treatment of severe or\nsymptomatic hypercalcaemia [IV, A].\n\u0003 The bone antiresorptive drug zoledronic acid is recom-\nmended as ﬁrst-line treatment and should be preferred\nover pamidronate for severe or symptomatic hypercalcae-\nmia [II, A].\n\u0003 Denosumab is recommended in patients with resistant\nhypercalcaemia [III, A; FDA approved, not EMA approved].\n\u0003 When a preoperative diagnosis of PC is made, upfront\nsurgery with en bloc removal of the parathyroid lesion\n(avoiding capsule rupture and local seeding), homolateral\nthyroid lobo-isthmectomy and central node dissection is\nrecommended [IV, A].\n\u0003 In case of pathological diagnosis of PC after parathyroid-\nectomy,\nreoperation\nwith\nipsilateral\nthyroid\nlobo-\nisthectomy and\ncentral node\ndissection\nshould\nbe\ndiscussed within 1 month of initial surgery [IV, A].\nFigure 6.

Brown\ntumours (osteolytic lesions of the bone caused by hyper-\nparathyroidism) should be differentiated from bone me-\ntastases, but this may be difﬁcult as they can show FDG\nuptake; MRI can be useful to better characterise bone le-\nsions.91 In case of known distant metastases, the probability\nof achieving a complete response is low and frequently only\nlocoregional treatments can control the disease.92 Cina-\ncalcet should be continued in case of persistent severe\nhypercalcaemia.\nData on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in PC are\nscarce with only 79 patients reported in the literature be-\ntween 1898 and 2018.93 A recent pooled analysis of all\nmetastatic PC cases reported that the most frequent\ntreatments were dacarbazine or anthracycline-containing\nChT and antiangiogenic drugs.93 The most frequent ChT\nprotocols included dacarbazine monotherapy, dacarbazinee\n5-FU, cyclophosphamide monotherapy or methotrexatee\ndoxorubicinecyclophosphamideelomustine, but response\nrates were low.93 Most cases in which antiangiogenics were\nused involved sorafenib.94,95 PC is usually radioresistant;\ndespite limited data showing that RT can be applied as\nadjuvant therapy to reduce local recurrence, its role is\nmainly palliative.85\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The efﬁcacy of systemic treatment in advanced and met-\nastatic disease is limited; thus, whenever possible,\ndebulking surgery and/or locoregional treatments should\nbe discussed to control tumour burden and hormonal\nsecretion [V, A].\n\u0003 First-line systemic treatment may involve antiangiogenic\ndrugs [V, B] or alkylating agent-based ChT (dacarbazine,\ntemozolomide or streptozocin combined with 5-FU or\ncapecitabine) [V, C].\n\u0003 Inclusion in clinical trials should be prioritised whenever\npossible [V, A].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nThe reported risk of recurrence is w50% at 2-5 years (based\nmainly\non\ncases\nin\nwhich\nnon-radical\nsurgery\nwas\nused).56,75-77,79 Laboratory follow-up includes lifelong mea-\nsurement of calcium and PTH every 3 months, although\nlonger intervals (up to 4-6 months) are an option.79 Pro-\ngressive and repeated increases in PTH and calcium levels\nare suggestive of PC recurrence and cross-sectional imaging\n(neck US, CT and/or MRI) should be carried out to identify\nthe site of recurrence. There is no validated role for scin-\ntigraphy with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI in the follow-up of PC.\nRecurrences and distant metastases can be small or\nbelow the resolution of imaging (<1 cm), and occasionally\nPC can evolve towards aggressive and rapidly progressive\nforms and lose the ability for signiﬁcant uptake of [99mTc]Tc-\nsesta-MIBI. In these cases, FDGePET can complement\nconventional imaging.\nThe identiﬁcation of a germline CDC73 mutation should\nprompt periodic screening for tumours associated with HPT-\nJT (ossifying ﬁbromas of the mandible or maxilla, benign\nand malignant uterine involvement, renal cysts).58 Genetic\ntesting should be carried out in all family members of\naffected individuals. In ﬁrst-degree relatives, measurement\nof\nserum\ncalcium\nlevels\nand\nUS\nmonitoring\nare\nrecommended.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Lifelong laboratory follow-up, including measurement of\ncalcium and PTH, is recommended every 3-4 months\nduring the ﬁrst 2 years, every 6 months during the sub-\nsequent 3 years and annually thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 In case of calcium and/or PTH elevation, neck US and CT\nscan of the neck, chest and abdomen together with a\nneck MRI are recommended [V, A]. FDGePET can be pro-\nposed to complete work-up, especially in rapidly pro-\ngressing cases [V, C].\nINTRATHYROID THYMIC CARCINOMA\nIncidence and epidemiology\nPreviously known as carcinoma showing thymus-like dif-\nferentiation (CASTLE), intrathyroid thymic carcinoma (ITC) is\nrare and believed to arise from the thymic remnants or\nbranchial pouch96 and, more rarely, from major salivary\nglands.97 ITC accounts for <0.15% of thyroid neoplasms.98\nFemales are affected slightly more frequently than males\nand the median age at diagnosis is 50 years.99\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nITC presents as a slow-growing neck mass with hard con-\nsistency and poor mobility, located at the lower poles of the\nthyroid gland. It appears as a cold nodule on thyroid scin-\ntigraphy and as a solid, heterogenous and hypoechoic mass\non US. Most patients have locally advanced disease with\ninvasion of surrounding structures, including the recurrent\nlaryngeal nerve, strap muscle, trachea, oesophagus, soft\ntissues and skin. Cervical lymph nodes are frequently\ninvolved but few patients have distant metastases.99 At\ndiagnosis, w20% of patients have dyspnoea, dysphagia,\nright laryngeal nerve paralysis and pain. FNA does not\nprovide a deﬁnitive diagnosis; histological conﬁrmation is\nwarranted.\nITC exhibits histological and immunophenotypic re-\nsemblances to eutopic thymic carcinoma. The tumour cells\ngenerally grow in a solid or nested pattern, identical to\nsquamous-cell carcinoma arising in the thymus. Positive IHC\nresults for cluster of differentiation (CD)5, CD117 and p63\nsuggest\na\ndiagnosis\nof\nITC\n(see\nSection\n8\nof\nthe\nSupplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\nESMO Open\nJ. Hadoux et al.\n12\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\n\n---\n1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Similar to thymomas and\nthymic carcinoma, on comparative genomic hybridisation\nITC is characterised by chromosomal imbalances such as\ngains on chromosomal arm 1q and losses on 6p, 6q and\n16q.100 The most frequently altered gene is the telomerase\nreverse transcriptase promoter mutation C228T, identiﬁed\nin 22% of cases.101 EGFR mutations have been docu-\nmented102 but their prevalence cannot be estimated due to\nthe limited number of cases analysed.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 ITC should be suspected in the presence of a cold nodule\nin the lower lobes of the thyroid gland with a cytological\ndiagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma [V, A].\n\u0003 Positive IHC for CD5, CD117 and p63 may allow for a pre-\noperative diagnosis [V, B].\n\u0003 Histological features that allow for a post-operative diag-\nnosis of ITC are lymphoid stroma, squamous-cell differen-\ntiation, infrequent mitoses and rare necrosis, positive IHC\nfor CD5, CD117 and p63, negative IHC for thyroglobulin,\nTTF-1 and calcitonin, and Ki-67 <20% [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nDisease stage is the main prognostic factor. Application of\nthe eighth edition of the UICC staging classiﬁcation25 for\nthyroid tumours is recommended, even if not speciﬁc for\nITC (see Supplementary Table S12, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Neck US, CT of the\nneck, thorax and abdomen, and neck MRI can be used for\nstaging. On CT, ITC appears as a well-deﬁned soft tissue\ndensity without calciﬁcation, whereas on MRI, it appears as\nan isointense and hyperintense mass on T1/T2-weighted\nimages.103 Similar to thymoma, ITC can show intense up-\ntake on FDGePETeCT; however, data on the use of FDGe\nPETeCT in patients with ITC are very limited.104\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Accurate assessment of local extension with US or MRI is\ncrucial for planning appropriate surgical intervention\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 CT of the chest and abdomen should be carried out to\nrule out the rare possibility of distant synchronous metas-\ntasis [V, A]. Complementary FDGePETeCT may be useful\nin some cases [V, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nSurgery is the treatment of choice (Figure 7). A pooled\nanalysis of published cases99 showed that thyroidectomy\n(total, subtotal or near total) was the most frequent surgical\nprocedure. Due to frequent nodal involvement at diagnosis,\nneck lymph node dissection [i.e. modiﬁed radical neck\ndissection (levels I-V), selective neck dissection of central\ncompartment (level VI) or lateral selective neck dissection\n(levels II-IV)] was carried out in >55% of cases. Among\npatients with a small ITC, 40% underwent thyroid lobec-\ntomy without lymph node dissection. RT was used in only\ntwo cases of locally advanced ITC not amenable to surgery\nwith radical intent.\nThe prognosis for patients with local or locoregional\ndisease is very good. In the pooled analysis,99 estimated\nmedian disease-free survival was 144 months (range 91-197\nmonths), median OS was not reached and w85% of\nFigure 7.

Based on these data,\nsurgery is recommended as the ﬁrst-line therapeutic option\nin patients with ITC with locoregional disease. The type of\nsurgery (i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be plan-\nned according to the available guideline for thyroid can-\ncers,28 using conservative surgical treatment whenever\npossible. Adjuvant RT does not improve prognosis and can\nbe avoided in most patients, although it may be discussed\nfor more advanced or aggressive cases. There is no role for\nadjuvant ChT. Patients with locoregional disease not\namenable to surgery with radical intent could be offered RT\nor chemoradiotherapy (CRT).\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Surgery is the mainstay of therapy. The type of surgery\n(i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be planned ac-\ncording to the available guidelines for thyroid cancers\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 Due to the indolent course of the disease and its good\nprognosis, conservative surgical treatment is preferred\nwhenever possible [V, B].\n\u0003 Neck dissection should be carried out according to guide-\nlines for thyroid cancers [V, A].\n\u0003 RT or CRT are reasonable options in case of locally\nadvanced disease not suitable for radical surgery [V, B].\n\u0003 If possible, adjuvant RT should be avoided due to the\nindolent disease course of ITC [IV, D]. It is an option in\nselected cases after careful multidisciplinary discussion\n[IV, B].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nAmong 120 patients with ITC who underwent primary\ntumour resection, 29 (24%) experienced recurrence at a\nmedian of 19 months (range 13-25 months).99 The recur-\nrence was locoregional in 21 patients (72%), and was\ntreated surgically in 90% and using RT in 42% of cases, with\nexcellent prognosis. A minority (w10%) of patients devel-\noped distant metastases; ﬁve patients (4%) had metastases\nat diagnosis and eight (6%) developed metachronous\ndistant metastases. The most common metastatic site was\nthe lung. Data on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in\npatients with metastatic ITC are limited. Similar to the\nrecommendations for locally advanced or metastatic thy-\nmoma or thymic carcinoma,28 cisplatin-containing regimens\nhave been used in most ITC cases, with a reported objective\nremission rate of 58%.99 Immunotherapy with the immune\ncheckpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab was used in one case,\nresulting in long-lasting disease control. Based on this single\nexperience, it is not possible to recommend immuno-\ntherapy for the treatment of metastatic ITC.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In case of local recurrence, salvage surgery is recommen-\nded [IV, A] and adjuvant RT may be discussed by an MTB\nfor patients who have not received prior RT [V, B].\n\u0003 In case of metastatic disease, cisplatin-based combination\nChT regimens with either doxorubicin and cyclophospha-\nmide or etoposide are the recommended options [V, B].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up is aimed at identifying locoregional recurrences\nand, more rarely, distant recurrences, usually within the ﬁrst\n5 years after initial treatment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In localised disease, neck US and CT scan of the neck and\nthorax are recommended 6-12 months after initial treat-\nment and then annually up to 5 years [V, C].\n\u0003 In metastatic disease, follow-up by CT and/or MRI (in case\nof liver, bone or brain metastases) every 3-6 months is rec-\nommended, depending on the tumour growth rate [V, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG was developed in accordance with the ESMO\nstandard\noperating\nprocedures\nfor\nCPG\ndevelopment\n(https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-\nMethodology).

Die Diagnose wurde histologisch bestätigt. Die Patientin ist 65 Jahre alt und hat keine bekannten Komorbiditäten, die eine aggressive Therapie ausschließen würden. Die Hyperkalzämie ist ein lebensbedrohlicher Zustand, der dringend behandelt werden muss. Das fortgeschrittene Stadium des Karzinoms mit Lungenmetastasen bedeutet, dass eine kurative Resektion nicht möglich ist. Die primäre Behandlungsstrategie muss daher auf die Kontrolle der Erkrankung, die Linderung der Symptome (insbesondere der Hyperkalzämie) und die Verbesserung der Lebensqualität abzielen.\n</beurteilung>\n\n<therapieempfehlung>\n1.  **Management der Hyperkalzämie:**\n    *   **Akut:** Aggressive intravenöse Hydratation mit isotoner Kochsalzlösung (z.B. 0,9% NaCl) mit einer Rate von 200-300 ml/h, bis die Hydratation erreicht ist und die Urinausscheidung > 100 ml/h beträgt.\n    *   **Medikamentös:**\n        *   **Bisphosphonate:** Intravenöse Gabe von Zoledronsäure (z.B. 4 mg über 15 Minuten) oder Pamidronsäure. Dies ist die bevorzugte Therapie zur Senkung des Kalziumspiegels bei malignomassoziierter Hyperkalzämie.\n        *   **Denosumab:** Eine Alternative zu Bisphosphonaten, insbesondere bei Niereninsuffizienz oder wenn Bisphosphonate nicht vertragen werden (60 mg subkutan).\n        *   **Calcitonin:** Kann zusätzlich zu Bisphosphonaten oder Denosumab eingesetzt werden, um den Kalziumspiegel schnell zu senken (z.B. 4 U/h subkutan oder i.m. für 48 Stunden). Die Wirkung ist jedoch oft kurzlebig.\n        *   **Kortikosteroide:** Können bei malignomassoziierter Hyperkalzämie, insbesondere bei hämatologischen Malignomen oder Lymphomen, hilfreich sein, aber ihre Rolle beim Parathyreoidkarzinom ist weniger klar.\n    *   **Weitere Maßnahmen:** Vermeidung von Diuretika (außer Thiaziden), Mobilisierung des Patienten, wenn möglich, und gegebenenfalls Dialyse bei schwerer Hyperkalzämie oder Niereninsuffizienz.\n\n2.  **Systemische Therapie:**\n    *   **Chemotherapie:** Da es keine standardisierte, effektive Chemotherapie für Parathyreoidkarzinom gibt, sollte eine platinbasierte Kombination (z.B. Cisplatin oder Carboplatin) in Betracht gezogen werden, möglicherweise in Kombination mit einem Taxan (Paclitaxel oder Docetaxel) oder Gemcitabin. Die Wahl sollte auf Basis der verfügbaren Evidenz (oft Fallberichte oder kleine Serien) und des Allgemeinzustands der Patientin getroffen werden. Die Therapie sollte palliativ mit dem Ziel der Krankheitskontrolle und Symptomlinderung erfolgen.\n    *   **Zielgerichtete Therapie:** Es gibt keine etablierten zielgerichteten Therapien für Parathyreoidkarzinom. Die Untersuchung auf spezifische Mutationen (z.B. RET, MEN1) könnte in Zukunft therapeutische Optionen eröffnen, ist aber derzeit nicht Standard.\n    *   **Immuntherapie:** Die Rolle der Immuntherapie (z.B. Checkpoint-Inhibitoren) ist beim Parathyreoidkarzinom unklar und sollte derzeit nur im Rahmen klinischer Studien oder als letzte Option in Betracht gezogen werden.\n\n3.  **Lokale Therapie:**\n    *   **Chirurgie:** Eine Resektion des Primärtumors und/oder der Metastasen ist in der Regel nicht kurativ und wird nur in ausgewählten Fällen (z.B. isolierte, resektable Metastasen) oder zur Linderung lokaler Symptome (z.B. Atemnot durch Lungenmetastasen) in Betracht gezogen.\n    *   **Strahlentherapie:** Kann zur Linderung lokaler Symptome (z.B. Schmerzen durch Knochenmetastasen, Kompression von Atemwegen durch Lungenmetastasen) eingesetzt werden.\n\n4.  **Supportive Therapie:**\n    *   **Schmerzmanagement:** Adäquate Schmerztherapie ist essenziell.\n    *   **Ernährungsberatung:** Unterstützung bei der Aufrechterhaltung des Ernährungszustands.\n    *   **Psychosoziale Unterstützung:** Begleitung der Patientin und ihrer Angehörigen.\n    *   **Palliativmedizinische Betreuung:** Frühzeitige Einbindung eines Palliativmedizin-Teams zur Optimierung der Lebensqualität und Symptomkontrolle.\n\n</beutheilung>\n\n<begründung>\nDie Therapieempfehlung basiert auf den aktuellen ESMO-Leitlinien für neuroendokrine Neoplasien und Parathyreoidkarzinome sowie den allgemeinen Prinzipien der palliativen Krebstherapie.\n\n*   **Hyperkalzämie:** Die aggressive Behandlung der Hyperkalzämie ist lebensrettend und hat höchste Priorität. Bisphosphonate oder Denosumab sind die Standardtherapie für maligne Hyperkalzämie.\n*   **Systemische Therapie:** Da Parathyreoidkarzinom selten ist und keine standardisierte, effektive Therapie existiert, wird eine platinbasierte Chemotherapie als palliativ empfohlen, um die Krankheitslast zu reduzieren und Symptome zu lindern. Die Wahl der spezifischen Chemotherapie sollte individuell getroffen werden.\n*   **Lokale Therapie:** Lokale Therapien wie Chirurgie oder Strahlentherapie haben in der Regel nur eine palliative Rolle bei fortgeschrittenem Parathyreoidkarzinom.\n*   **Supportive Therapie:** Eine umfassende supportive Therapie, einschließlich Schmerzmanagement, Ernährungsberatung und psychosozialer Unterstützung, ist entscheidend für die Verbesserung der Lebensqualität der Patientin. Die frühzeitige Einbindung der Palliativmedizin ist essenziell.\n\nDie Prognose für Patienten mit fortgeschrittenem Parathyreoidkarzinom ist generell schlecht. Die Therapieziele sind daher primär palliativ ausgerichtet: Kontrolle der Symptome (insbesondere der Hyperkalzämie), Verlängerung der Lebensdauer und Verbesserung der Lebensqualität.\n</begründung>\n```",

Both malignancies are rare. ACC has an estimated\nincidence of w0.5-2 new cases per million people per year.1,2\nPhaeochromocytomas are catecholamine-producing neuro-\nendocrine tumours arising from chromafﬁn cells of the\nadrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia. The latter are\nusually called paraganglioma, leading to the combined term\nphaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs). The\ndetected incidence of PPGLs is commonly reported at 2-8 per\nmillion per year3 (supplementary information, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).\nAll patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL\nshould be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team\nmeeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis (ideally\nbefore surgery) and in case of progressive disease.\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nEvery patient with (suspected) ACC or PPGL should undergo\ncareful clinical assessment, including case history, clinical\nexamination for symptoms and signs of adrenal hormone\nexcess. For more details on this topic, we refer to more\ncomprehensive guidelines and reviews.3-8\nHormonal evaluation\nThe aims of hormonal evaluation are multiple: (i) hormone\nassays provide orientation to the nature of the adrenal\nmass and can be useful to assess presence of malignancy;\n(ii) a phaeochromocytoma should always be ruled out,\nbecause these tumours can induce life-threatening crises,\nrequiring speciﬁc management before any intervention; (iii)\nmassive adrenocortical steroid excess can impact short-\nterm survival and quality of life (QoL), requiring speciﬁc\ntreatments to block impacts of hormonal excess; (iv)\nabnormal hormone secretions may serve as biological\nmarkers for the follow-up of patients; (v) in case of large\nbilateral adrenal masses, a systematic assessment of adre-\nnal function is recommended to rule out adrenal insufﬁ-\nciency. Precise hormone assays have been detailed in recent\nguideline statements,4,5,9,10 and are summarised in Table 1.\nFor all adrenal masses, the diagnosis of phaeochro-\nmocytoma\nshould\nbe\nsystematically\nassessed\nby\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: June 2020.

For differential diag-\nnosis of an adrenal mass, computed tomography (CT) and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both effective [IV, A].\nAlthough these methods cannot determine the exact entity\nof the mass, both are able to correctly diagnose a subset of\nbenign tumoursdat least when carried out according to\nstate-of-the-art criteria. The single best criterion to diagnose\na benign tumour (e.g. adenoma) remains Hounsﬁeld units\n\u000210 in an unenhanced CT.17 However, other imaging\ncriteria, such as rapid washout in 10- or 15-min delayed\ncontrast-enhanced CT, signal intensity loss using opposed-\nphase MRI, and low 2-ﬂuorine-18 [18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-\nglucose (FDG) uptake in [18F]FDG-positron electron to-\nmography (PET)/CT are also suggestive of a benign tumour.\nMost ACCs show an inhomogeneous appearance in CT or\nMRI with irregular margins and irregular enhancement of\nsolid components after intravenous injection of contrasted\nagent. Detection of local invasion or tumour extension into\nthe inferior vena cava, as well as lymph node or other\nmetastasesdincluding lung and liverdis mandatory before\nplanning any surgery. Therefore, cross-sectional imaging\nof the chest, abdomen and pelvis is required preoperatively\n[V, A].\nFor PPGLs, conventional radiological imaging can be\nimportant to determine the presence of metastases. How-\never, neither CT nor MRI can be used to determine whether\nPPGLs are benign or malignant. Malignancy can only be\ndetermined from the presence of metastatic lesions at sites\nwhere chromafﬁn cells are normally absent. Without such\nevidence, all PPGLs should be considered potentially ma-\nlignant, with risk dependent on several factors as outlined\nbelow.\nThere are a number of functional imaging modalities\navailable for patients with PPGLs (supplementary File,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). The indication is twofold: (i) best tumour staging in\npatients with suspected metastases (e.g. by conventional\nimaging) or with presumably high risk for metastases; (ii) to\nevaluate the option of a radionuclide-based therapy in pa-\ntients with nonresectable PPGL. For assessments of meta-\nstatic risk for the ﬁrst indication the authors suggest the\npresence of one or more of the following criteria:\n\u0003 tumour size \u00045 cm;\n\u0003 any extra-adrenal paraganglioma;\n\u0003 known succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur\nsubunit B (SDHB) germline mutation; or\n\u0003 plasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above\nthe upper cut-offs of reference intervals.\nFor imaging-based diagnosis of metastatic PPGLs, it is\nimportant to avoid confusing metastases with multiple\nprimary tumours that often occur in patients with heredi-\ntary PPGL syndromes. Additionally, local recurrences should\nnot be misdiagnosed as metastases.\nPathology\nBiopsy of adrenal tumours is usually contraindicated\nbecause of the risk of tumour spillage, poor diagnostic po-\nwer to discriminate benign from malignant adrenocortical\ntumours and risk of hypertensive crises in phaeochromo-\ncytoma. However, a biopsy might be indicated in an adrenal\nmass without any hormone excess in patients with a history\nof extra-adrenal cancers to exclude or prove an adrenal\nmetastasis of an extra-adrenal malignancy, and in patients\nin whom tumour sequencing is desired.\nThe pathological differential diagnosis of adrenal neo-\nplasias in both biopsied and resected specimens is primarily\nbased on morphological features requiring an experienced\npathologist [IV, A]. Preferably, a panel of immunohisto-\nchemical markers should be applied to aid diagnosis; for\nexample, steroidogenesis factor 1 (SF1) or, alternatively,\ninhibin-alpha, calretinin and melan-A for identiﬁcation of\nadrenocortical tumours and chromogranin A for identiﬁca-\ntion of PPGL [IV, A]. Staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and\nsynaptophysin may also be helpful to highlight PPGL, but\npositive results for synaptophysin are also possible in\nadrenocortical tumours. The differential diagnosis between\nACC and adenoma may be challenging as no single marker\nindicates malignancy. The most widely used diagnostic score\nhas been introduced by Weiss18,19 and includes nine pa-\nrameters (supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099) [IV, A]. A score of \u00043\nsuggests malignancy. In addition, the Ki-67 labelling index,\nas a marker of proliferative activity, may be useful and is\nvery\nhelpful\nfor\nprognostic\npurposes\n(supplementary\nTables S2 and S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nannonc.2020.08.2099).\nFor phaeochromocytomas, the situation is similarly\ndemanding. Tumour size, SDHB mutation status, extra-\nadrenal location and plasma methoxytyramine may all be\nused to indicate riskof metastasis. However,there is no single\nhistological or immunohistochemical parameter that can\npredict the clinical behaviour of PPGL. Nevertheless, several\nhistological scoring systems have been developed.20-23 All\nthese scores have value but none of them has reached\ngeneral acceptance. Therefore, according to the current\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcation, all PPGLs\nshould be considered to have some malignant potential.24 A\ndeﬁnitive diagnosis of malignancy can only be made by the\npresence of metastases at sites where chromafﬁn tissue is\nnormally absent (e.g. liver, bone, lungs or lymph nodes),\nassessed by pathology or imaging, in particular functional\nimaging.\nM.

The\ngene encoding subunit B of the SDHB complex is by far the\nmost important molecular contributor to malignant PPGL,\nwith at least 40% of all cases of metastatic PPGLs carrying\nmutations of this gene.25 Inactivation of SDHB reduces\nfunction of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, leading\nto activation of the hypoxia-inducible pathway and a\npseudohypoxic state characterised by increased angiogen-\nesis, growth and expression of mitogenic factors,26 but also\nto DNA hypermethylation, which is believed to provide a\nfurther drive to metastatic progression.27\nAt least 35% of PPGLs result from germline mutations of\nover 18 tumour-susceptibility genes identiﬁed to date,28-33\nwith those resulting in stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible fac-\ntors 1a and 2a (HIF1a and HIF2a) carrying a higher risk of\nmetastatic disease than those due to other mutations\n(supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). Risk is particularly high, reach-\ning 70% in patients with PPGL due to mutations in the SDHB\ngene.34 The vast majority of all metastatic PPGLs, including\ndisease due to SDHB mutations, develop from noradrenergic\nor dopaminergic PPGLs with poorly developed secretory\npathways. Nevertheless, a small minority of about 10% of\nmetastatic PPGLs develop from adrenal adrenergic tumours\nthat are characterised by production of epinephrine, as man-\nifested by increased plasma or urinary metanephrine.35\nOf note, metastatic disease may only become apparent\nmany years after the primary tumour is resected. This and\nlater development in some patients of locally recurrent\ndisease underscore the importance of recommendations for\nfollow-up of all patients with previously resected PPGLs.9\nRecommendations\n\u0003 All patients with an adrenal tumour suspected to be an\nACC or a phaeochromocytoma should undergo careful\nclinical assessment for signs of adrenal hormone excess.\n\u0003 All patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL\nshould be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team\nmeeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis and in\ncase of progressive disease.\n\u0003 All patients with suspected ACC require a comprehensive\nendocrinework-uptoidentifypotentialautonomousexcess\nTable 1.

Recent data suggest\nthat lymph node involvement correlates with stage IV\nrather than stage III behaviour.37\nOverall, the prognosis of ACC is limited. However, pro-\nspective data suggest that in patients with complete\nresection of a localised stage II tumour 5-year overall sur-\nvival (OS) can be as high as 90%.38 In metastatic ACC, me-\ndian survival is about 15 months. However, even in this\ngroup, there is a subgroup of patients with long-term\nsurvival.36,37\nIt is well established that disease stage and margin-free\nresection are currently the most important prognostic fac-\ntors in ACC. For the European Society of Endocrinology\n(ESE)eENSAT guidelines, a comprehensive literature search\nfor prognostic factors has been carried out and only the\nproliferation marker Ki-67 and glucocorticoid excess showed\na robust association with prognosis [IV, A] (supplementary\nTable S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.\n08.2099).4,39 Many other (molecular) markers for aggres-\nsiveness and survival have been recently proposed, but their\nclinical use requires validation.\nPPGL\nIn 2017,the WHO proposed a tumourstaging system for PPGL\n(supplementary Table S6, available at https://doi.org/10.1\n016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).24 Although this staging classi-\nﬁcation remains to be validated, the authors recommend\nusing this system to harmonise disease classiﬁcation.\nDespite limitations, the authors suggest assessing the risk\nof metastatic disease in an individualised manner, taking into\naccount previous history of disease and the presence or\nabsence of a germline mutation of a tumour-susceptibility\ngene (supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/\n10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). For ﬁrst-time patients\nwithout any history of disease or known mutation, size and\nlocation of the primary tumour, and when available, any el-\nevations of plasma methoxytyramine during biochemical\ntesting seem important to consider when evaluating risk\nfor malignancy. As described above, the authors suggest\nestablishing ‘high risk of metastases’ when any patient pre-\nsents with one or more of the following criteria: (i) adrenal\nphaeochromocytoma \u00045 cm; (ii) an extra-adrenal para-\nganglioma; (iii) a known SDHB germline mutation; or (iv)\nplasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above the\nupper limit of reference intervals. In these patients, whole-\nbody functional imaging may be justiﬁed, particularly for\ncases involving more than one of those four criteria.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The ENSAT TNM system should be used for initial staging\nof ACC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Genetic counselling should be offered to all patients with\nPPGL.\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nSurgery\nSurgery is essential for treatment of both ACC and phaeo-\nchromocytoma.

In addition to\nexpertise in adrenal surgery, sufﬁcient experience in onco-\nlogical surgery is essential [V, B].4 For best clinical outcome,\nthe entire operative team (including anaesthesiologists)\nshould be well-trained in adrenal surgery.\nM.

Therefore, a\nmargin-free complete resection (R0 resection) is key to\nachieving long-term survival [V, A].2,44 In order to obtain an\nR0 resection of a locally advanced ACC, it may be necessary\nto resect (parts of) adjacent organs such as the wall of the\nvena cava, liver, spleen, colon, pancreas and/or stomach [V,\nB]. Complete en bloc resection of the tumoural mass,\nincluding periadrenal fat and adjacent organs if necessary, is\nmandatory to avoid tumour rupture or spillage that por-\ntends an adverse outcome.45 Locoregional lymphadenec-\ntomy improves tumour staging and seems to lead to a\nfavourable oncological outcome.46\nRoutine lymphadenectomy should include at least the\nperiadrenal and hilar nodes [IV, A], although the best extent\nFigure 2.

One study with 207 patients\n(including 88 with mitotane) found that adjuvant mitotane\nwas associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS)50;\nhowever, the mitotane group was likely selected for a higher\nrisk of recurrence, a bias that cannot be fully adjusted for in\nmultivariate analysis.\nProbably, the best evidence supporting adjuvant mitotane\nuse comes from a multicentre, case-control study that cir-\ncumvented confounders by comparing patient groups treated\nat centres adopting two different treatment strategies. The\nstudy involved 177 patients, of whom 47 were followed in\nItalian reference centres that systematically adopted adjuvant\nmitotane to all radically operated ACC. Fifty-ﬁve Italian pa-\ntients and 75 German patients were followed in institutions\nnot administering adjuvant mitotane therapy.51 The outcome\nof this cohort has been recently updated, conﬁrming that the\nmitotane-treated patients have prolonged RFS compared with\npatients left untreated after surgery.52\nTwo recent meta-analyses have reported that adjuvant\nmitotane treatment reduces the risk of recurrence and\ndeath.4,53 In both analyses, the beneﬁt associated with mito-\ntane was signiﬁcant forOS, whereas itwas signiﬁcant forRFS in\nonly one study.53 Another retrospective multicentre study\ndemonstrated that blood mitotane concentrations \u000414 mg/l\nwere associated with a prolonged RFS in patients treated with\nadjuvant mitotane following macroscopically radical surgery.54\nOn these bases, the recent ESEeENSAT guidelines on the\nmanagement of ACC suggest that patients at high risk of\nrecurrence (stage III, or R1-RX resection, and/or Ki-67 index\n>10%) should be offered adjuvant mitotane [IV, B].4 By\ncontrast, adjuvant therapy has to be discussed on an individual\nbasis in patients fulﬁlling all the following criteria: stage I or II\ndisease, histologicallyproven R0 resection and Ki-67expressed\nin \u000210% of neoplastic cells, which deﬁne the category of low\nrisk of recurrence [V, B] (Figure 1).4 For these patients, the\nresults of the still ongoing randomised ADIUVO trial55 testing\nthe efﬁcacy of adjuvant mitotane therapy are awaited.\nThere are no data regarding the optimal duration of\nadjuvant mitotane; however, the authors recommend that\nadjuvant mitotane should be administered for at least 2\nyears [V, B], because the greatest frequency of disease\nrecurrence is expected within this time frame. However, it is\nnot advised to continue adjuvant mitotane beyond 5 years,\ndue to the low number of ACC recurrences occurring after\nthis time [V, B].4\nAdjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is able to reduce the risk of\nlocal recurrence but does not prevent distant recurrences\nand, as a consequence, does not impact OS.4 Therefore, it is\nreasonable to associate mitotane with RT in selected pa-\ntients with stage III ACC and/or R1 or RX resection, although\nthe combination carries increased toxicity [IV, B].4\nThe adjuvant use of cytotoxic drugs is not well established\nin ACC. Nevertheless, some centres are beginning to apply\ncytotoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin plus etoposide) in selected\npatients with very high riskof recurrence and this approach is\nbeing investigated in a randomised trial (NCT03583710).\nSpecial considerations on mitotane. Mitotane is a difﬁcult\ndrug to manage, with a long half-life, dose-limiting toxicity\nand a narrow therapeutic window.

AsinACC,thesurgicalexcisionofthetumouristheﬁrst-\nline treatment of PPGLs (Figure 2). However, laparoscopic/\nminimal invasive surgery is commonly the technique of ﬁrst\nchoice for resection adrenal and extra-adrenal PPGLs [V, A],\nbecause local invasion is rare and the likelihood of rupture of\nthe capsule seems less common than in ACC. It is obvious,\nhowever,that the resection should be complete and if there is\nany risk that this cannot be achieved by laparoscopic surgery,\nan open approach should be carried out. In patients with\nPPGL, exposure to high levels of circulating catecholamines\nduring surgery could cause hypertensive crises and arrhyth-\nmias. Therefore, all patients with PPGL should receive pre-\noperative preparation at least 10-14 days before surgery [V,\nA].5 Blood pressure targets for the treatment are <130/80\nmmHg in the supine position, and a systolic blood pressure\npreferably >90 mmHg in the upright position. The noncom-\npetitive a-adrenoreceptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, is\ntraditionally the most frequently used adrenergic blocking\nagent. A standard starting dose is 10 mg twice daily with ad-\njustments over the following days. Alternatively, doxazosin, a\ncompetitive and selective a1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, can\nbe similarly effective. If the target blood pressure is not\nreached, calcium antagonists (slow-release nifedipine) or\nmetyrosine may be used. Blockade of b-adrenergic receptors\nis indicated in patients developing tachyarrhythmias but\nshould never be started before blockade of a-receptors.\nGiven the likelihood of rapid intraoperative haemody-\nnamic lability, continuous monitoring of arterial and central\nvenous pressures is essential throughout surgery. Although\ntoday’s volatile anaesthetics are not inductive of hyperten-\nsive crisis, such crises can be induced by other manipulations\nduring surgical procedure (e.g. intubation, insufﬂation of\nperitoneum, direct palpation of the PPGL) or administration\nof certain drugs (e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines).56 Therefore,\nit is strongly recommended that anaesthesia is supervised by\nan experienced anaesthesiologist alert to the diagnosis of a\ncatecholamine-producing tumour. Hypertension during sur-\ngery may be treated with magnesium sulfate, intravenous a-\nadrenoreceptor antagonists (e.g. phentolamine), calcium\nantagonists and/or nitroprusside or nitroglycerine. Tachy-\ncardia can be treated with intravenous b-adrenergic receptor\nblockers (e.g. esmolol). Postoperative hypotension should be\nprevented by saline infusion the day before surgery. If this\nadverse event occurs, it should be treated aggressively. In\ngeneral, sufﬁcient rehydration and treatment of constipation\nare important parts of the preoperative management. Post-\noperative care should also focus on glucose levels because\nhypoglycaemia may occur after reduction of catecholamine\nlevels. Cytoreductive debulking surgery (R2) in malignant\nphaeochromocytoma may improve QoL and survival by\nreducing tumour burden and controlling hormonal hyperse-\ncretion [V, B].3\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Indeed, prolonged\nsurvival has been reported especially in patients with\nresectable oligometastatic disease, with long intervals be-\ntween recurrences.57,58\nIn general, ﬁrst-line therapy in patients with advanced/\nmetastatic disease is mitotane alone or mitotane plus\nchemotherapy (ChT). Surgery and locoregional therapies\nshould be adopted in addition to systemic therapy in\nselected patient populations (Figure 3). The goal of the\ntherapy is to control tumour growth, hypersecretion-related\nsymptoms and prolong survival.\nA study of the ENSAT network recently identiﬁed the\nprognostic factors in patients with advanced disease.\nAccordingly the stage, as redeﬁned by a modiﬁed ENSAT\n(mENSAT) classiﬁcation,37 which takes into account the\nnumber of tumoural organs, has a major prognostic role\ntogether with the following four parameters grouped under\nthe label GRAS: (i) tumour Grade, (ii) Resection status of the\nprimary tumour, (iii) Age, and (iv) tumour-related or\nhormone-related Symptoms. Based on these results, a risk\nstratiﬁcation was introduced.59 Although this new risk\nclassiﬁcation looks interesting, it needs conﬁrmation in\nother studies before being fully applicable in clinics.\nMitotane\nmonotherapy.\nMitotane\nis\nthe\nonly\ndrug\napproved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in\nlocally\nadvanced\ninoperable\nand\nmetastatic\npatients\n(supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099);\nnevertheless,\nrandomised\ncontrolled prospective trials are lacking. Response rates in\nmetastatic ACC vary between 13% and 35% but much of\nthese data are derived from retrospective series, including\nstudies in 1960s with overall variability in response criteria.4\nFor details on mitotane management, see above and\nsupplementary Table S7, available at https://doi.org/10.10\n16/j.annonc.2020.08.2099. Owing to the latency of mito-\ntane to attain the therapeutic range, mitotane mono-\ntherapy is indicated in the management of patients with a\nlow tumour burden and/or more indolent disease (i.e. pa-\ntients with favourable prognostic parameters). At disease\nprogression, ChT with etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin\n(EDP) should be added to mitotane monotherapy [I, A].\nCytotoxic ChT. The combination of EDP and mitotane (EDP-M)\nis recommended in ﬁrst-line settings based on the FIRM-ACT\ntrial results [I, A] (supplementary Table S8, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099 and Figure 3).\nIn the phase III randomised trial including 304 patients,\nprogression-free survival (PFS) was clearly superior in patients\ntreated with EDP-M compared with patients treated with\nstreptozocin plusmitotane[5.0versus2.1months,hazardratio\n(HR) 0.55, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.43-0.69, P < 0.001].60\nHowever, the difference in OS was not signiﬁcant (14.8 versus\n12.0months, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02,P ¼ 0.07), presumably\ndue to the crossover and presence of mitotane in both arms.\nInterestingly, a survival advantage of the EDP-M arm was\nobserved in patients, who could not receive the second-line\ntherapy. In patients unsuitable for EDP-M, mitotane in com-\nbination with etoposide and cisplatin [V, B],61 or mitotane plus\ncisplatin, is an option [V, B].62\nM. Fassnacht et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 11\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099\n1485\n\n---\nIn second-line settings, after failure of EDP-M, the treat-\nment options are limited63 and enrolment of patients into\nclinical trials should be considered ﬁrst. Most patients with\nadvanced ACC remain in good clinical condition but urgently\nseek therapy. In the absence of trials, possible options are the\nassociation of gemcitabine plus capecitabine64,65 or strepto-\nzocin (supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/1\n0.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).60 With both treatments, the\nmedian PFS is short, between 2 and 4 months. Mitotane\ntherapy is sometimes continued in association with second-\nline therapies. However, this must be discussed with the\npatient according to tolerance to the drug and its effect on\nhormonal secretion. The optimal timing to discontinue\nmitotane is debated and could be discussed with the patient\nindividually in cases of progressive disease despite ‘thera-\npeutic’ drug levels or highest tolerated doses assessed at two\ndistinct evaluations.\nSurgery and local therapies. Surgery, including surgery of\nthe primary tumour, may be recommended in all patients\nwith oligometastatic ACC if a complete resection of all\ntumoural lesions is feasible [V, B].4 Additionally, patients\nwith an indolent disease course or under therapeutic\ncontrol might be eligible for surgery. It is also worthwhile\nto consider surgery or other local therapies in all patients\nin whom systemic therapy led to an objective response\nor long-term stable disease [V, B].66,67 A cytoreductive\nresection may also be indicated in rare cases of severe\nsymptomatic hormone excess, after attempts to control\nthe symptoms with a combination of fast-acting anti-\nsecretory agents (i.e. metyrapone) and mitotane68 and\nlocal therapies [V, B]. In these patients, postoperative\nmitotane is clearly advised [V, A]. Local therapies [e.g. RT,\nchemoembolisation,\nradiofrequency\nablation\n(RFA)]\nshould also be discussed in all patients with advanced\noligometastatic ACC [V, B].4\nIn case of a recurrence following ACC surgery, two critical\nquestions must be addressed: (i) What is the time interval\nsince the resection? and (ii) Did recurrence occur during\nongoing mitotane therapy (with effective blood levels)? If the\ndisease-free interval is at least 12 months and another\ncomplete R0 resection/ablation seems feasible, then surgery\nor, alternatively, other local therapies are clearly recom-\nmended [IV, A].69,70 However, if this time interval is <6\nmonths orifcomplete resection/ablation is not feasible,then,\nthe EDP-M provides the treatment of choice, especially if the\nrecurrence occurred during ongoing mitotane treatment at\ntherapeutic levels [IV, A].\nMolecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Several\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been investigated as\nsecond-line approaches in small phase II trials involving\nadvanced ACC (for review, see4,71). Results, however, have\nfailed to show signiﬁcant therapeutic efﬁcacy. In addition,\nthe insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor\nlinsitinib was tested in a multicentre placebo-controlled\nphase III trial (GALACTIC trial) and failed to improve\neither PFS or OS of advanced ACC patients who had already\nreceived systemic antineoplastic therapies.72\nThe results of the ﬁrst (small) trials with immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors in ACC were heterogeneous, with\nmedian PFS times of 1.8, 2.1, 2.6 and 6.75 months,\nrespectively.73-76 However, in one study with 39 patients,\ndisease control rate was 52% and median OS reached\nalmost 25 months, clearly suggesting that a least a subset of\npatients beneﬁts from this therapeutic approach.76\nManagement of hormone excess. In addition to sequelae\nof the malignant disease, patients with overt hyper-\ncortisolism suffer from immunosuppression, diabetes and\nmuscle weakness, which can signiﬁcantly impact QoL.\nSimilarly, severe androgen excess may dramatically impair\nwell-being in women. Therefore, medical therapy to control\nhormonal excess is recommended [V, A]. Mitotane is\nfrequently able to diminish steroid excess, but its efﬁcacy is\noften delayed by several weeks. In these circumstances,\nsteroidogenic enzyme inhibitors, such as metyrapone or\nketoconazole, can be useful [V, B]. Metyrapone is a well-\ntolerated drug and its metabolism and elimination are not\naltered by concomitant mitotane. Therefore, it can be safely\nadministered in association with mitotane and cytotoxic\nChT.68 Local therapies including liver embolisation may also\nbe discussed. All patients with clinically overt hormone\nexcess should be managed by physicians experienced with\nthese endocrine problems.\nPPGLs\nThe therapeutic strategy for metastatic PPGL primarily aims\nto control excessive catecholamine secretion and tumour\nburden, as there are no curative treatment options. Choices\nfor treatment include a watch-and-wait policy (including\nalpha blocker to control hypertension), locoregional thera-\npies,\nradiopharmaceutical\nagents,\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nmolecular-targeted therapies (Figure 4, supplementary\nTable S9, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2020.08.2099). Such choices should be discussed case by\ncase in a multidisciplinary specialised setting. In the absence\nof any published randomised trials and demonstrated\nimpact on survival, QoL for patients should always be\nconsidered in any justiﬁcation for a speciﬁc therapeutic\nintervention. Indeed, due to the indolent course of disease\nin some patients,77 an active surveillance policy may be\nindicated for those who are asymptomatic, have a low-to-\nintermediate tumour burden and absence of localised\ncomplications of any mass. In these patients, treatment-\nrelated adverse events may exceed any beneﬁt of therapy.\nSurgery. Although there is little possibility of a cure for\nmetastatic PPGLs, surgical resection of the primary tumour\nor metastatic lesions should be considered on a case-by-\ncase basis. Debulking surgery can improve symptoms and\npotentially prognosis by reducing secretion of catechol-\namines.78 Other local therapies are available for patients\nwith metastases, such as RT, RFA or chemoembolisation.\nLocal measures are also important to prevent bone-related\nevents.79 However, as with any invasive procedure, local\nablation may induce massive tumoural catecholamine\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Radionuclide therapy is an effective\ntreatment and [131I]MIBG is one of the most frequent ap-\nproaches with radionuclide doses ranging widely from 5.5\nto 38 GBq (150-1000 mCi). Approximately 50% of patients\nare eligible for [131I]MIBG therapy based on uptake from\ndiagnostic scans. Several studies have been published on\nthe efﬁcacy of [131I]MIBG treatment,3 mostly retrospective\nand only two prospective phase II trials.81,82 In both trials,\nobjective responses were observed in 23% of cases ac-\ncording to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours.\nLong-term survival of responders of over 6 years has been\nreported but progression at study entry was not a prereq-\nuisite for most studies. Objective responses were mainly\nobserved in patients with soft tissue metastases. Grade 3-4\ntoxicity was reported in 16%-83% of patients, mainly hae-\nmatological including myelodysplastic syndrome especially\nwith high activity doses.3,82 [131I]MIBG therapy could be\nconsidered as ﬁrst-line approach in patients displaying avid\nuptake of [123I]MIBG in all tumoural lesions who have\nunresectable, progressive PPGL or high tumour burden\n[III, A].\nAn alternative approach is a peptide receptor radioligand\ntherapy using somatostatin analogues labelled with iso-\ntopes delivering a cytotoxic radionuclide. More than 80% of\nPPGLs are detectable by somatostatin-based imaging.83 In\npatients with high uptake of PET tracers, such as gallium-68\n(68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogues (e.g. [68Ga]DOTA-\nTATE or DOTATOC or DOTANOC), treatment with yttrium-\n90-labelled [90Y]DOTATOC or lutetium-177-labelled [177Lu]\nDOTATATE could be similarly effective as MIBG-based\ntherapy, although the number of published studies/case\nseries is limited [V, B].84 Both radionuclide approaches can\nbe applied repeatedly (with a minimum time interval of 3-4\nmonths). However, toxicity frequently becomes a limiting\nfactor over time and beneﬁt should be re-evaluated after\nevery second therapy.\nSystemic ChT. Systemic ChT might be considered as a ﬁrst-\nline treatment in patients with PPGL who have no signiﬁ-\ncant uptake of radiotracers or that are also rapidly pro-\ngressing and associated with high tumour burden or are\nhighly symptomatic [IV, B]. ChT with cyclophosphamide- and\ndacarbazine-based regimens combined with vincristine (CVD)\nand/or doxorubicin (CVDD or CDD) are the most studied\nregimens.85 In the largest published study to date (n ¼ 52\npatients), 40% of patients treated with CVD, CDD or CVDD\nexperienced clinical beneﬁt, including reduction in tumour\nsize in 25% of cases.86 Based on retrospective data, temozo-\nlomide, an oral alternative to dacarbazine, seems to be as\neffective as the previous polyChT regimens.87 These studies\nsuggest that patients with SDHB mutations are especially\nsensitive to temozolomide due to the association with\nhypermethylation of the promoter for O6-methylguanine-\nDNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Furthermore, recent case\nreports provide limited evidence that metronomic temozo-\nlomide is also effective as a second-line therapy.88\nTargeted therapies. There is a rationale and some evidence\non the potential efﬁcacy of antiangiogenic drugs in malig-\nnant\nphaeochromocytomas,\nespecially\nthose\nbearing\nSDHB gene mutations.89 Sunitinib is a potent TKI, including\nvascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 1\nand 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)\nbeta, KIT, FLT3 and RET, and has been the most-studied\ntargeted therapy in PPGL. In addition to several impres-\nsive case reports involving sunitinib, there is one retro-\nspective series with 17 patients with progressive metastatic\nPPGL.90 Of 14 evaluable patients, three had a partial\nresponse (21%) and ﬁve had stable disease (36%). Median\nPFS was 4.1 months and OS 27 months. As hypertension is\na key feature of PPGL and a major adverse event of suni-\ntinib, special attention is required to deal with this issue.\nThere are currently several ongoing trials on sunitinib\nincluding a randomised, placebo-controlled trial testing\nsunitinib in patients with malignant PPGL, now closed for\nrecruitment (FIRST-MAPPP trial, NCT01371201).\nA phase II study with pazopanib involving seven patients\n(study closed because of poor accrual) reported one\nconﬁrmed partial response (17%, duration 2.4 years) and\nmedian PFS and OS of 6.5 and 14.8 months, respectively.91\nRecommendations\nACC\n\u0003 In most patients with metastatic ACC, ﬁrst-line therapy\nwith mitotane alone or mitotane plus ChT is recommen-\nded; EDP-M is the ﬁrst-line treatment of choice [I, A].\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. low tumour burden and/or\nmore\nindolent\ndisease),\nmitotane\nmonotherapy\nis\nreasonable.\n\u0003 Surgery and locoregional therapies should be adopted in\naddition\nto\nsystemic\ntherapy\nin\nselected\npatient\npopulations.\n\u0003 Surgery is the treatment of choice only if all tumoural le-\nsions can be removed [V, B].\n\u0003 Local therapies (e.g. RT, RFA, cryoablation, microwave\nablation, chemoembolisation) are of value for therapy\nin advanced ACC, and an individualised treatment\napproach is required [V, B].\nPPGL\n\u0003 Although there are no curative treatment options, treat-\nment choices include watch-and-wait, locoregional ther-\napies, radiopharmaceutical agents, systemic ChT and\nmolecular-targeted therapies.\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. with low tumour burden\nwithout relevant symptoms), a watch-and-wait policy\n(including alpha blocker to control hypertension) is\npreferred.\n\u0003 In all patients with metastatic PPGL (debulking) surgery\nshould be considered.\nM.

In these guidelines, we follow the recom-\nmendations provided recently by other groups.4,9 For locally\nadvanced or metastatic disease, OS and time-to-progression\nare the most important end points, response rate and\ntreatment toxicity providing secondary end points. Time-to-\nprogression, ORR and treatment toxicity guide clinical\ndecision making in individual patients; they should be\nevaluated at regular intervals during treatment using CT\nscans and/or MRI and laboratory results (supplementary\nFile, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). For patients opting for entirely palliative manage-\nment, no systematic imaging is advised. Information on\nlong-term implications, patient experience, psychological\nimplications and effect of rehabilitation is lacking for ACC\nand PPGL. At least, speciﬁc management of survivors should\nbe based on individual needs and preferences.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines have been produced by\nESMO in partnership with EURACAN, the European Refer-\nence Network for rare adult solid cancers. These Clinical\nPractice Guidelines were developed in accordance with the\nESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical Practice\nGuidelines development (http://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/\nESMO-Guidelines-Methodology). They are conceived to\nprovide the standard approach to diagnosis, treatment and\nsurvivorship on ACC and PPGL. Recommended interventions\nare intended to correspond to the ‘standard’ approaches,\naccording to current consensus among the European\nmultidisciplinary experts in the management of these\nextremely rare diseases. These are represented by the\nmembers of the ESMO Faculty and experts belonging to the\nEndocrine Tumour domain of EURACAN, the ENSAT and the\nEuropean Reference Network on Rare Endocrine Conditions\n(Endo-ERN).\nExperimental interventions considered to be beneﬁcial\nare labelled as ‘investigational’. Other nonstandard ap-\nproaches may be proposed to the single patient as ‘options’\nfor a shared patientephysician decision in conditions of\nuncertainty, as long as some supporting evidence (though\nnot conclusive) is available.

They help health pro-\nfessionals weigh the beneﬁts and the risks of available diagnostic\nor therapeutic options. Randomised clinical trial (RCT) data on\nthe management of thyroid cancer (TC) are relatively scarce, and\nthe quality of available evidence is suboptimal. Retrospective\nanalyses of treatment efﬁcacy frequently show favourable out-\ncomes, but it is difﬁcult to discern the extent to which these\nresults are due to the natural history of the disease. The number\nof cases retrospectively analysed is not an index of the quality of\nthe data or the absence of biases. Consequently, large, well-\nplanned RCTs managed within a network of coordinated centres\nare urgently needed.\nThe main goals of any cancer treatment are to improve overall\nsurvival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Persistent disease in low-\nrisk TC patients is often associated with prolonged survival. The\nindolent behaviour of the tumours in these individuals—the vast\nmajority of the patients seen by clinicians—argues for the use of\nless aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches than those\nreserved for higher-risk patients. Therefore, clinical practice\nguidelines are also intended to provide oncologists with cost-\neffective strategies that will minimise the risks associated with\novertreatment.\nIncidence and epidemiology\nThe last three decades have witnessed steady, worldwide increases\nin the incidence of TC [1, 2]. Figures from the European Network\nof Cancer Registries show estimated incidence rates among\nfemales in 2012 that were approximately threefold higher than\nthose for males (9.3 and 3.1 cases per 100 000 person-years, re-\nspectively) [1]. Rates vary widely from country to country, with\nthe highest ﬁgures (per 100 000 person-years) reported in\nLithuania (15.5), Italy (13.5), Austria (12.4), Croatia (11.4) and\nLuxembourg (11.1). Estimated TC-related mortality rates, by\ncontrast, are low (0.7 and 0.5 cases per 100 000 person-years for\nwomen and men, respectively) with considerably less regional\nand temporal variation [3].\nThe rising incidence rates are almost entirely due to the\nincreased diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) and\npapillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) in particular. Incidence rates for\nfollicular (FTC), anaplastic (ATC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid\ncancers have remained relatively stable over the past 30 years. The\nexpanding use of imaging techniques, biopsy procedures [e.g.\nﬁne-needle aspiration (FNA)] and medical surveillance, along\nwith improved access to healthcare, has facilitated the detection\nof small, subclinical PTCs [4]. The resulting overdiagnosis has in-\nvariably been accompanied by overtreatment [5]. According to\nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force, the risks associ-\nated with TC screening in asymptomatic adults are likely to\nV\nC The Author(s) 2019.

Support is also growing for\nmore conservative, risk-tailored strategies for TC management\n(including watchful waiting) [7–10].\nDTC and poorly differentiated TC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nThe diagnostic work-up of DTCs (including poorly differentiated\nforms) comprises pre- and postoperative pathological and mo-\nlecular assessments. Preoperative FNA for cytology is not\nrequired for nodules measuring \u00021 cm. Decisions to aspirate\nlarger nodules should be guided by lesion size and sonographic\nappearance [8]. Cytology ﬁndings are classiﬁed into diagnostic\ncategories associated with different risks of malignancy [11].\nMost malignant thyroid tumours can be identiﬁed cytologically.\nNotable exceptions are FTCs and the newly deﬁned ‘non-invasive\nfollicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features’\n(NIFTP), which are usually classiﬁed as indeterminate in the vari-\nous thyroid cytology reporting schemes [12]. FNA-based diagno-\nsis of poorly differentiated carcinoma is also challenging unless\nthere is obviously increased mitotic activity and/or necrosis. FNA\ndiagnosis can be facilitated by assessment of malignancy markers\n(including proteins commonly overexpressed in tumours, e.g.\nHBME1 or galectin-3) and molecular alterations speciﬁcally asso-\nciated with malignancy (e.g. BRAF mutations, RET fusions, other\nnovel gene alterations). Speciﬁcally designed gene panels are re-\nportedly useful for identifying malignancy when cytology sam-\nples are morphologically indeterminate [13].\nResected DTCs are histologically classiﬁed according to the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) criteria (updated in 2017—\nTable 1). Based on clinical evidence of their low-grade behaviour\nduring long-term follow-up, encapsulated non-invasive follicular\nPTC variants are now referred to as NIFTPs. They account for up\nto 20% of cases in Europe [14]. Elimination of the term ‘carcin-\noma’ from the deﬁnition of this PTC variant underscores its ex-\ncellent prognosis: NIFTP is associated with no reports of cancer-\nrelated deaths and an estimated risk of recurrence of <1%. This\nnew entity shows partial overlap with the group of tumours\ndeﬁned in Europe as ‘well-differentiated tumours of uncertain\nmalignant potential’ [15]. Diagnosis of NIFTP requires a scrupu-\nlous pathological examination of the follicular-pattern nodule to\nconﬁdently exclude the presence of capsular invasion (even\nmicroscopic) and papillary formations. RAS but not BRAF muta-\ntions characterise NIFTPs. Correct identiﬁcation of NIFTPs\nshould reduce the unnecessary use of radical surgical procedures\nand the needless administration of radioactive iodine (RAI) after\na completion thyroidectomy. NIFTP follow-up strategies should\nmimic those of very-low risk carcinomas (see following sections).\nThere are numerous other PTC variants, including some that are\nparticularly aggressive and associated with higher tumour stages\nand lymph node metastases at diagnosis. The best-known of these\nare the tall cell, columnar, hobnail and solid variants [16, 17].\nThe WHO currently recommends reporting FTCs as ‘minimal-\nly invasive’ when capsular penetration is present without vascular\ninvolvement (a condition associated with an extremely good\nprognosis). The terms ‘angioinvasive’ and ‘widely invasive’\nshould be reserved for follicular cancers with neoplastic emboli\ninvolving <4 or \u00034 blood vessels, respectively.\nThe diagnostic criteria for poorly differentiated carcinomas re-\nmain controversial. A consensus conference in 2006 yielded the\nTurin proposal [18], which restricts this diagnosis to invasive\ntumours with a solid/trabecular/insular growth pattern plus at\nleast one of the following:\n• mitotic index \u00033 per 10 high-power ﬁelds;\n• necrosis;\n• convoluted nuclei (slightly smaller and darker than those typ-\nically seen in PTC, with irregular contours).\nThis deﬁnition delimits a category of TCs that behave aggres-\nsively while maintaining some degree of functional differenti-\nation [e.g. thyroglobulin (Tg) production].\nHu¨rthle cell carcinomas are no longer classiﬁed as ‘follicular\ntumours’, which are generally much less aggressive and less likely\nto present with lymph node metastases [16]. Hu¨rthle cell carcino-\nmas associated with extensive vascular and/or capsular invasion\nshould be managed like other high-risk carcinomas (see following\nsections). ‘Pure’ Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas (i.e., those with a\nHu¨rthle-cell component exceeding 75%) also present molecular\nabnormalities that distinguish them from conventional follicular\ncarcinomas. As for oncocytic PTCs and oncocytic variants of\npoorly differentiated carcinomas, they are no more aggressive\nthan their conventional counterparts.\nMolecular proﬁling has distinguished two major classes of PTCs\ncharacterised by BRAF-predominant and RAS-predominant mo-\nlecular signatures (Table 1) [19]. BRAF V600E mutations are fre-\nquently reported in a subgroup of PTCs with more aggressive\nclinicopathological behaviours, but the need for routine BRAF gen-\notyping of PTCs has not been established. The fatal forms of non-\nATC are generally PTC variants harbouring BRAF or RAS\nmutations plus other genomic alterations (e.g. mutations involving\nthe TERT promoter, TP53, POLE, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway\neffectors, SWI/SNF subunits and/or histone methyltransferases),\nsome of which are potential therapeutic targets [20]. The molecular\nproﬁles of follicular and Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas are less well-\ndeﬁned. Work is underway to deﬁne the genomic and transcrip-\ntomic proﬁles of poorly differentiated and anaplastic TCs [21, 22].\nStaging and risk assessment\nMortality risk. The Union for International Cancer Control\n(UICC) tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation of malig-\nnant tumours stages lesions based on their mortality risks. The\neighth edition [23] introduced important changes for thyroid\ntumours, including the downstaging of extrathyroidal extension\nthat is not macroscopically evident (pT3b) (Table 2). Primaries\nwith extrathyroidal spread that is exclusively microscopic are\nnow staged solely on the basis of tumour size as pT1, pT2 or\npT3a. TNM staging requires a complete review of prognostically\nrelevant morphological and immune-phenotypic parameters\n[20]. A checklist containing these parameters can be included in\nthe ﬁnal pathology report [IV, A] to supply details on the extent\nof invasion (capsular versus vascular, including number of\naffected vessels), tumour size and architecture, presence of necro-\nsis, proliferative activity, etc. [10].\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1857\n\n---\nRisk of persistent or recurrent disease. Table 3 summarises the\nsystem developed in 2015 by the American Thyroid Association\n(ATA) to estimate the risk of persistent or recurrent TC based on\ndata available shortly after treatment of the primary cancer\n[8, 24–26]. These criteria have now been revised and reﬁned\nbased on emerging evidence. The likelihood of persistent/recur-\nrent disease after an apparently complete resection depends on\nseveral factors. The overall estimated risk of recurrence ranges\nfrom <1% to 55% and is classiﬁed as low (\u00025%), intermediate\n(6%–20%) or high (>20%). A high-quality pathology report is\ncrucial for proper risk stratiﬁcation.\nThe initial risk class assignment is revised during follow-up to\nreﬂect the evolution of the disease and responses to treatments\n(dynamic\nrisk\nstratiﬁcation)\n[IV,\nA]\n[27–30].\nTreatment\nresponses are deﬁned as excellent, biochemical incomplete, struc-\ntural incomplete or indeterminate based on imaging ﬁndings >\n[mainly neck ultrasound (US)] and serum Tg and anti-Tg anti-\nbody (TgAb) levels (see Table 4) [8].\nPrimary tumour management\nSurgery. Primary tumour management will be determined by the\nresults of the preoperative risk assessment (Figure 1). Active US\nsurveillance of the thyroid and neck lymph nodes (every 6–\n12 months) can be proposed for unifocal papillary microcarcino-\nmas (\u000210 mm) with no evidence of extracapsular extension or\nlymph node metastases [III, B] [31]. In these cases, the only\nknown predictor of signiﬁcant tumour growth (\u00033 mm) or the\nonset of lymph node metastasis is age (10-year estimated risks:\n36% in patients <30 years old, 14% in those aged 30–50, 6% in\npatients 50–60 years old) [32].\nFor other TCs, total thyroidectomy is still considered the stand-\nard surgical treatment. Two large database studies on surgical man-\nagement strategies found that, for selected low-risk tumours (T1a–\nT1b–T2, N0), lobectomy alone does not reduce OS [IV, B] [33,\n34], but it may be associated with a slightly higher local recurrence\n[8]. However, even large database studies are subject to biases. In\nrisk-beneﬁt analyses, it is important to recall that total thyroidec-\ntomy can cause recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.5%, bilateral in\nrare cases) and temporary or permanent hypoparathyroidism\n(8.1%) [35]. The risk (even when done by high-volume surgeons)\nis almost twice that of lobectomy alone, and postoperative compli-\ncations are generally more likely with low-volume surgeons [36].\nThe use of prophylactic central neck dissection for low-risk\ntumours (T1b–T2, N0) varies from centre to centre [IV, C]\n[37–39]. Evidence of its effect on recurrence-free survival is con-\nﬂicting, and there is no high-level evidence for or against its use-\nfulness for low-risk tumours. Studies supporting prophylactic\nneck dissection for low-risk tumours have shown moderate\nreductions in central neck recurrence (5%–10%) but no im-\nprovement in OS. Prophylactic neck dissection does allow more\ncomplete staging of neck nodes, including identiﬁcation of\nmicrometastases not visible on preoperative US, and this infor-\nmation can be used to reﬁne the prognosis and guide subsequent\ntreatment and follow-up. Risks, however, include temporary\nhypoparathyroidism and overdiagnosis and overtreatment of\nsubclinical micrometastases. The potential beneﬁts of prophylac-\ntic neck dissection for low-risk tumours are now being evaluated\nin an RCT (NCT03570021—ESTIMABL3). For more invasive\ntumours (T3–T4), prophylactic neck dissection may improve re-\ngional control [IV, C] [40].\nRAI therapy. RAI is administered after total thyroidectomy for\nseveral reasons:\n• to eliminate the normal thyroid remnant, thereby ensuring\nundetectable serum Tg levels (in the absence of neoplastic tis-\nsue), which facilitate follow-up (remnant ablation);\n• to irradiate presumed foci of neoplastic cells, thereby reduc-\ning the recurrence risk (adjuvant therapy); and/or\nTable 1.

Some authors consider it a more aggressive form of DTC. When associated with extensive vascular and/or capsular invasion,\nthe recurrence risk should be classiﬁed as high. For minimally invasive Hu¨rthle cell carcinoma, robust data are lacking on the true risk of recurrence.\nfThe BRAF V600E mutation is associated with aggressive histologic features, lymph node metastases and ETE, but its relative contribution to the risk of recur-\nrence is not well-deﬁned. Co-existing BRAF V600E and TERT mutations act synergically to increase the risk of recurrence [25, 26].\n131I, iodine-131; ATA, American Thyroid Association; DTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; ERR, estimated risk of recurrence; ETE, extrathyroidal extension; FTC,\nfollicular thyroid cancer; NIFTP, non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features; PTC, papillary thyroid cancer; RAI, radioactive\niodine; Tg, thyroglobulin; WHO, World Health Organization.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1860 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\n• to treat persistent or recurrent disease (treatment of known\ndisease) [8].\nIn all three cases, RAI administration must be followed by an\niodine-131 (131I) whole-body scan (WBS) to stage the disease\nand document the 131I avidity of any structural lesion. The esti-\nmated level of risk for persistent/recurrent disease will deter-\nmine whether and how much RAI is given. Low activities are\nusually given for remnant ablation (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq); high\nactivities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) are used for treatment pur-\nposes. To optimise isotope uptake, RAI should be given after\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation, which can be\nachieved by withdrawing levothyroxine for 4–5 weeks, ideally\nuntil serum TSH levels reach \u000330 mIU/ml. Alternatively, re-\ncombinant human TSH (rhTSH) can be given (two daily injec-\ntions of 0.9 mg of rhTSH followed by RAI on day 3). The\nresulting TSH level is not usually measured (unless doubts arise\nas to whether the injections have been properly administered).\nLevothyroxine withdrawal is preferred if distant metastases are\npresent. The use of rhTSH is associated with superior short-\nterm QoL [41].\nAs shown in Figure 2, practice guidelines unanimously recom-\nmend treatment with high RAI activities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq)\nfor patients with high risk of recurrence [IV, A] [7–10, 42]. RAI\nadministration is not recommended for certain low-risk patients\n[i.e. those with a small (\u00021 cm) intrathyroidal DTC and no evi-\ndence of locoregional metastases] [II, E] [43]. The term ‘very\nlow-risk’ is often applied to these patients in the literature [7, 44].\nThere is less consensus regarding other low-risk DTC patients\n[IV, C] (see Table 3). In 2015, the ATA guidelines advised against\nthe systematic use of RAI in the latter group [8]. However, the\nEuropean Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) has not\nendorsed this recommendation [45], mainly because prospective\nRCT data showing that surveillance is non-inferior to RAI ad-\nministration are lacking. The ATA, the EANM, the Society of\nNuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) and the\nEuropean Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published a\njoint statement acknowledging the absence of high-quality evi-\ndence either for or against the postoperative use of 131I in low-\nrisk patients [46]. They conclude that decisions should be taken\non an individual basis, depending on tumour features (e.g. risk of\nrecurrence) (see Table 3), patient-related factors (e.g. comorbid-\nities, motivation, emotional concerns), health-care setting (e.g.\navailability and quality of thyroid surgeons, US, RAI imaging, Tg\nassays) and the local management team’s preferences. Lastly, the\nexpected beneﬁts of a given RAI dose should outweigh the risks\nassociated with its administration, which include adverse events\n(AEs) and diminished QoL [43]. The usefulness of 131I therapy in\nlow-risk TC patients is now being assessed in two large RCTs\n(NCT01837745—ESTIMABL2,\nNCT01398085—IoN).\nTwo\nother RCTs (ESTIMABL1 and HiLo) conducted in low-risk DTC\npopulations showed that, if RAI is given in these cases, low activ-\nities (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq) following rhTSH and high activities\n(100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) following levothyroxine withdrawal are\nequally likely to produce successful ablation [I, A] [47, 48]. This\nequivalence is also evident at the level of recurrence-free survival,\nTable 4.

RAI adjuvant therapy can\nbe considered for intermediate-risk patients. Decisions on RAI\ndosage and TSH stimulation modalities are based on case\nfeatures—surgical, clinical and pathological (particularly the ex-\ntent of lymph node involvement and the aggressiveness of the\npathological subtype) [IV, B] [43]. If given, low to high activities\n(30 mCi, 1.1 GBq to 100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) are recommended. In\nthese patients, the ATA recommends individualised decision\nmaking [8].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up tools and schedules (Figure 3) vary according to the\ntumour histotype, initial treatment, initial risk of persistent/re-\ncurrent disease (Table 3) and responses to treatment (Table 4).\nSerum Tg assays and neck US are the mainstays of DTC follow-\nup [51]. Patient management can be improved when health pro-\nfessionals collaborate as members of a multidisciplinary team.\nSerum Tg. Serum Tg is a sensitive marker for the presence of thy-\nrocytes, but it cannot discriminate between normal and\nmalignant cells. Undetectable levels thus have high negative pre-\ndictive values, but detectable values can be false-positives. To\nminimise variability, Tg levels should ideally be measured with\nthe same assay [52]. Concomitant assessment of serum TgAb is\nmandatory, as these antibodies can interfere with Tg assays, caus-\ning false-negative or, less commonly, false-positive results [53].\nSerum Tg can be assayed under basal conditions (i.e. during levo-\nthyroxine treatment) or after endogenous (levothyroxine with-\ndrawal) or exogenous (rhTSH injection) TSH stimulation. In\npatients treated with total thyroidectomy plus RAI remnant abla-\ntion, stimulated serum Tg levels <1 ng/ml are highly predictive of\nan excellent response to therapy, and subsequent stimulated Tg\nassays are unnecessary [54]. High-sensitivity (<0.2 ng/ml) assays\nof basal Tg levels can also be used to verify the absence of disease\n(excellent response) [II, B] [55]. If negative imaging ﬁndings are\naccompanied by detectable Tg levels, the treatment response is\nclassiﬁed as indeterminate or biochemical incomplete (Table 4).\nIn this case, the positive predictive value increases with the serum\nTg level or, if serial measurements are available, with levels that\nincrease over time. Almost 60% of patients who have total thyroi-\ndectomy without postoperative RAI administration will have\nbasal serum Tg levels \u00020.2 ng/ml [56, 57], which indicates an\nDTC \nafter TT ± neck dissection\nTherapeutic\nResidual disease (incomplete surgery, M1)\nRAI-refractory diseasea\n1.

When\nserum Tg levels are detectable, serial measurements of Tg should\nbe obtained on levothyroxine treatment [IV, B] [56, 57]. A simi-\nlar approach might be used following lobectomy [IV, C] [28].\nIncreasing Tg levels are highly suspicious for persistent/recurrent\nDTC, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nNeck US. Neck US is the most effective tool for detecting struc-\ntural disease in the neck, particularly when remnants of normal\nthyroid tissue are present. Combined with the results of FNA cy-\ntology [58] and serum Tg assays, neck US ﬁndings can achieve an\naccuracy of nearly 100% [59]. The shortcomings of US include\nsubstantial operator dependency [60], a high frequency of non-\nspeciﬁc ﬁndings [61] and the possibility of unsatisfactory visual-\nisation of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by\nbone or air. The latter sites are better explored with cross-\nsectional imaging modalities (see below). Abnormal US ﬁndings\ncan be classiﬁed as indeterminate or truly suspicious (Table 5)\n[62, 63]. Unlike PTC, FTC metastasis is typically haematogenous\nand rarely involves the locoregional lymph nodes, so neck US in\nthese cases serves mainly to exclude residual/recurrent thyroid-\nbed disease.\nOther imaging studies.

Recommendations for postoperative management of DTC patients.\naIsolated measurements of serum Tg cannot be reliably interpreted in the presence of normal thyroid tissue. The trend over time of basal Tg\nshould be used in patients with residual thyroid tissue and might also be used in case of lobectomy. Rising Tg is highly suspicious for persist-\nent/recurrent disease, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nbHighly sensitive (<0.2 ng/ml) assays of basal Tg can be used in lieu of TSH-stimulated Tg to verify the absence of disease.\ncIn patients with serum TSH level of 0.5–2 mIU/ml after lobectomy, levothyroxine replacement therapy is not mandatory.\ndIn patients with excellent response to therapy, repeat neck US may be avoided.\neShort serum Tg doubling time (<1 year) is associated with poor outcome in DTC patients [72] and should prompt imaging staging.\nfShort tumour growth doubling time (<1 year) may guide the choice of starting a treatment [95].\ngIf FDG is normal, WBS can be carried out after the administration of a therapeutic activity.\nDTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; FDG, ﬂuorodeoxyglucose; FDG–PET, [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomography;\nON-LT4-Tg, thyroglobulin measurement on levothyroxine; q x months, every x months; RAI, radioactive iodine; rhTSH, recombinant human\nthyroid stimulating hormone; RRA, radioiodine remnant ablation; RxWBS, therapeutic whole-body iodine-131 scan; Tg, thyroglobulin; TgAb,\nserum thyroglobulin antibody; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total thyroidectomy; US, ultrasound; WBS, whole-body scan.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1864 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nTgAb levels in the absence of sonographically identiﬁable neck\ndisease or in patients with intermediate-to-high risks of persist-\nent/recurrent disease, irrespective of the neck US ﬁndings)\n[IV, B] [8].\nA WBS can be carried out after the administration of diagnostic\nor therapeutic doses of RAI. Because its sensitivity is low (27%–\n55%), diagnostic WBS is not indicated during follow-up [IV, A]\n[64]. Uptake is highly speciﬁc (91%–100%) for the presence of\nthyroid tissue, but false-positive results are possible. In these cases,\nsingle-photon emission computed tomography or computed\ntomography (CT) offers better anatomic resolution [64].\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomog-\nraphy (FDG–PET) combined with CT is useful for assessing the\nextent of disease and deﬁning the prognosis [65, 66]. Its sensitiv-\nity is around 94%, and speciﬁcity is between 80% and 84%.\nFDG–PET is more sensitive than therapeutic WBS for detecting\npersistent disease in patients with negative cross-sectional imag-\ning studies, serum Tg levels >10 ng/dl, and/or aggressive histo-\ntypes (e.g. aggressive PTC, poorly differentiated TC, widely\ninvasive follicular carcinoma) [67]. FDG uptake is associated\nwith a worse prognosis and refractoriness to RAI treatment [68,\n69], but it is not a reliable predictor of tumour growth [70].\nFDG–PET is the ﬁrst-line isotopic imaging technique for patients\nwith RAI-refractory disease.\nCross-sectional imaging modalities should be chosen on\nthe basis of the anatomic region to be explored. CT is best for\nneck and chest imaging. Contrast enhancement is used for\nstudies of the neck and mediastinal lymph nodes but not\nfor the lungs. All forms of RAI treatment should be deferred\nfor at least 6 weeks after administration of any iodinated con-\ntrast medium. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imag-\ning (MRI) is appropriate for exploring the neck, liver,\nbones and brain [64]. MRI of the neck is subject to\nsubstantial image degradation due to respiratory motion,\nand a CT scan is often a better alternative. Suspected\naerodigestive-tract involvement should always be assessed\nendoscopically.\nFollow-up strategies. All patients with DTC should have neck US\nand serum Tg and TgAb assays 6–18 months after primary\ntreatment (surgery 6 RAI therapy). The subsequent follow-up\nschedule will depend on the initially estimated risk of persistent/\nrecurrent disease and responses to therapy (Figure 3).\nPTC patients at low risk for recurrence who have no evidence\nof structural disease at the ﬁrst follow-up visit can be monitored\nwith periodic (12–24 months) Tg and TgAb assessments. Repeat\nneck US scans can be carried out as needed, depending on serum\nTg and TgAb levels [71]. The same schedule can be adopted for\nintermediate-risk PTC patients with excellent responses to treat-\nment [IV, A] [27, 30, 44]. TSH levels should be maintained in the\nlow-normal range (0.5–2 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. The follow-up\nprotocol for minimally invasive FTCs is often the same one used\nfor low-risk PTCs, although the evidence supporting such an ap-\nproach is insufﬁcient [V, C] [24].\nLow- or intermediate-risk PTC patients with a biochemical in-\ncomplete or indeterminate response to treatment should have\nserum Tg and TgAb assays and a neck US every 6–12 months.\nRising Tg or TgAb levels warrant further imaging studies [72].\nMild TSH suppression should be considered (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) in\npatients at intermediate risk of recurrence [IV, B] [8].\nIn patients with high-risk PTCs, poorly differentiated TCs or\nwidely invasive FTCs, serum Tg and TgAb levels should be\nassessed every 6–12 months if the response to therapy is excellent\nor biochemical indeterminate/incomplete. Cross-sectional or\nfunctional imaging studies should be repeated if detectable Tg\nlevels persist [IV, B] [27, 30]. For patients whose recurrence risk\nis initially classiﬁed as high, a more in-depth imaging work-up\nmay be advisable even if serum Tg levels remain or become un-\ndetectable, as the absence of the circulating Tg may simply reﬂect\nthe dedifferentiation of any residual tumour tissue that might be\npresent [8]. Serum TSH levels should be suppressed in all patients\nwith biochemical incomplete or indeterminate responses to treat-\nment (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. Patients with structural in-\ncomplete responses can be placed on active surveillance or\nreferred for local or systemic treatments.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nDistant metastases occur in fewer than 10% of patients with\nDTC. Half are present when the tumour is ﬁrst discovered; the\nothers are found later, sometimes decades after initial treatment.\nMetastases are observed most frequently in patients with aggres-\nsive histological subtypes (e.g. tall-cell, hobnail, solid, diffuse\nsclerosing and columnar-cell variants): vascular invasion, large\nprimary tumours, macroscopic extrathyroidal extension, bulky\nlocoregional nodal disease [8]. The most common sites are lungs\nand bones (involved in 49% and 25% of all cases, respectively),\nand in 15% of cases, both are affected [73]. Bone metastases are\nmore common in FTC than in PTC (55.5% versus 31.5%, re-\nspectively). Spinal (34.6%) and pelvic (25.5%) bones are the\nmost frequently involved, followed by those of the chest (18.3%),\nextremities\n(10.2%),\nshoulder\ngirdle\n(5.4%)\nand\nthe\nTable 5.

Brain, liver and skin in-\nvolvement is less common. The overall mortality rates 5 and\n10 years after diagnosis of distant metastases are 65% and 75%,\nrespectively [75].\nDistant metastases are usually diagnosed because of clinical\nsymptoms or suspicious imaging/laboratory ﬁndings (abnormal\nuptake on a post-ablation WBS, or a positive ﬁnding on an FDG–\nPET-CT scan or a cross-sectional study prompted by elevated Tg\nlevels in patients whose post-ablation WBS is negative).\nRAI therapy. Patients with distant metastases should receive 100–\n200 mCi (3.7–7.4 GBq) of 131I after TSH stimulation [IV, A] [73].\nThe latter can be achieved with levothyroxine withdrawal or, if\nwithdrawal is clinically contraindicated or the patients has hypo-\npituitarism, with injections of rhTSH (Figure 2). One-third of\npatients have lesions that are not RAI-avid and are considered\nRAI-refractory [IV, A] (Figure 2) [73, 76]. If the distant metasta-\nses are RAI-avid, 131I is administered every 6 months for 2 years\nand less frequently thereafter. Between treatments, suppressive\ndoses of levothyroxine are given to maintain serum TSH levels\nbelow 0.1 mIU/ml (unless there are speciﬁc contraindications)\n[III, B] [77–79]. Data from some prospective cohort studies sug-\ngest that disease progression, recurrence and death rates are\nreduced in patients undergoing TSH suppression for structurally\nidentiﬁable disease [77, 79], but it is still unclear how much sup-\npression is appropriate [78]. Between treatments, efﬁcacy should\nbe veriﬁed with periodic cross-sectional imaging studies.\nCompared with repeated administrations of standard doses of\nRAI (100 mCi or 3.7 GBq), use of higher, dosimetrically deter-\nmined activities appears to offer no beneﬁts in terms of OS [80].\nWhen distant metastases lose their ability to concentrate RAI or\nstructural progression occurs within 6–12 months after RAI ad-\nministration, the disease is considered RAI-refractory [IV, A]\n(Figure 2) [73, 76]. A cure is unlikely if lesions persist after ad-\nministration of a cumulative dose of 600 mCi 131I, and decisions\non whether to continue RAI therapy will be based on tumour\nburden, RAI-uptake intensity and responses to previous RAI\nadministrations [73].\nOverall, one out of three patients with distant metastases will\nbe cured with RAI and have a near-normal life expectancy [73].\nThese are usually young individuals with well-differentiated TC\nand small non-FDG-avid metastatic lesions. The other patients\nwill at some point be classiﬁed as RAI-refractory; the prognosis in\nthese cases will vary, depending mainly on the tumour burden\nand growth rate. Overall, their 5-year survival is <50%. RAI re-\nfractoriness, however, remains uncommon, with an estimated in-\ncidence of 4–5 cases per million population. Drugs for re-\ninducing or increasing RAI uptake by the tumours are currently\nunder investigation. The selective kinase inhibitors dabrafenib\n[81], vemurafenib [82] and selumetinib [83] can reportedly re-\nstore RAI uptake and tumour responses in selected patients, espe-\ncially in those with small tumour burden and low progression\nrate. Several trials are underway to validate these preliminary data\n(NCT03244956, NCT02456701, NCT02145143, NCT02152995,\nNCT03363347), but thus far, none of the three drugs has been\napproved for this indication.\nLocoregional therapy. Several locoregional approaches can be\nused to treat TC. The data and indications discussed below,\nhowever, are based mainly on studies of other solid tumours.\nSpeciﬁc recommendations are lacking for DTC or MTC patients;\ntherefore, the indications for locoregional treatments of these\ntumours will be discussed together. ATC patients will be dis-\ncussed separately, as their poor prognosis is a major factor in all\ntreatment decisions.\nBone metastases: The relatively long survival perspective places\nTC patients with bone metastases at high risk of skeletal-related\nevents (SREs), i.e. pathological fractures, spinal cord compres-\nsion, need for radiation (for pain or impending fracture) or sur-\ngery and hypercalcaemia. Up to 37% of TC patients experience\nSREs, and they are associated with poorer prognoses [84, 85].\nThere is a strong rationale and some clinical data supporting\nthe roles for bone resorption inhibitors (bisphosphonates or\ndenosumab) [V, B], external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or other\nlocoregional treatments in reducing SREs [86]. Bisphosphonates\nand denosumab have each been shown to decrease SRE rates and\nbone pain associated with breast, prostate and lung cancers.\nInhibition of bone resorption should be considered in TC\npatients with multiple bone metastases. Treatment can be admin-\nistered every 4 weeks (bisphosphonates and denosumab) or every\n3 months (bisphosphonates). The optimal duration of treatment\nis unknown, but in other more thoroughly studied tumours (e.g.\nbreast, prostate, lung), a minimum of 2 years is recommended.\nAdequate calcium and vitamin D levels should be maintained\nduring treatment. The most signiﬁcant AE of these drugs is jaw\nosteonecrosis, and the risk is increased in patients receiving\nantiangiogenic therapy [87]. A baseline dental evaluation is\nthus mandatory before starting treatment with bone resorption\ninhibitors, and regular checkups are recommended during\ntreatment.\nIf the bone metastases are RAI-avid, RAI therapy may control\nthe disease for some time and alleviate or delay symptoms, but it\nis unlikely to eliminate these lesions. Locoregional treatments\nmay allow longer progression-free intervals and even cures in\npatients with targetable, oligometastatic bone disease. Surgery\nfollowed by EBRT is associated with the best outcomes, at least\nfor limb lesions [88]. If surgery is not feasible, bone lesions associ-\nated with pain or a high fracture risk should be treated with frac-\ntionated (20 Gy in ﬁve fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions) or\nsingle-fraction (8 Gy) EBRT and/or with interventional radiology\ntechniques, including cementoplasty and thermal ablation [89].\nFor spinal cord compression in a patient whose life expectancy\nexceeds 6 months, longer fractionation schedules (e.g. 30 Gy in 10\nfractions over 2 weeks) are recommended. If the life expectancy is\n\u00026 months, a single fraction of 8 or 20 Gy in ﬁve fractions should\nbe used to minimise hospitalisation [II, B] [90].\nPercutaneous vertebroplasty can reduce the pain and deform-\nity associated with vertebral body fractures. The efﬁcacy of this\ninnovative approach has not been directly compared with surgery\nand should only be done in high-volume centres to minimise the\nrisk of complications (e.g. cement leakage outside the bone).\nThere is limited evidence that other conservative techniques\n[radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryotherapy] are effective for\ntreating TC-related bone lesions [V, B] [91].\nPalliative EBRT alleviates pain and neurological complications.\nPain relief is often achieved 48–72 h after treatment, although it\nmay take up to 1 month.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1866 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nLung metastases: The lung is a common site of TC metastasis.\nThe lesions are usually multiple, bilateral, of varying size (from a\nfew millimetres to 1 cm) and asymptomatic. Metastasectomy is\nnot the standard approach for these lesions, but it may be consid-\nered for oligometastasis in patients with good performance status\n(PS) [V, C]. RFA is also a possibility for solitary lesions or those\ncausing a speciﬁc symptom due to their volume and location [V,\nC]. RFA is considered for lesions <2–3 cm in patients not eligible\nfor surgery or those requiring an extensive resection [92].\nLiver metastases: Liver metastases are rare in DTC but more\ncommon in MTC. Liver involvement usually presents with mul-\ntiple lesions, but if true solitary lesions are detected, they may be\ncandidates for local ablation. In MTC patients with a dominant\nlesion that is growing more rapidly than the background dis-\nease, local ablation (e.g. RFA) may be useful for controlling\nsymptoms, systemic ones in particular, such as diarrhoea. The\noutcome of RFA will depend on the size of the lesion (optimally\n<30 mm), its location (at least 3 mm from all vessels) and its\nvisibility on US. Direct comparisons of surgery and RFA are\nlacking. In general, individuals who are ineligible for surgery are\nnot the best candidates for percutaneous ablation. If both sur-\ngery and RFA are contraindicated, hepatic intra-arterial embol-\nisation with drug-eluting beads might be an option: it has been\nused in other solid tumours [93] but its efﬁcacy in TC has not\nbeen validated.\nInvasion of upper aerodigestive tract: Invasion of the upper\naerodigestive tract should always be excluded in TC patients with\nlocoregional disease. Suspicious symptoms include haemoptysis\nand dysphagia. Contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI are helpful\nfor exploring suspicious cases, although endoscopy is more de-\nﬁnitive. In selected cases (e.g. bleeding, exophytic lesions), local\ntreatment (e.g. laser excision) is advisable before starting antian-\ngiogenic multikinase inhibitor (MKI) therapy.\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. TSH suppression\n(serum level <0.1 lIU/ml) is recommended for all TC patients\nwith persistent structural disease in the absence of speciﬁc contra-\nindications [III, B] [77].

Temporal trends in the levels of\nserum tumour markers (e.g. Tg doubling time) can be used to\nsupport and help decision making [95]. Importantly, however,\nan increase in serum Tg levels in the absence of radiologically evi-\ndent disease progression should not be used to select patients\nrequiring systemic therapy. A complete cross-sectional imaging\nassessment of the extent of the disease is mandatory for any treat-\nment decisions. RECIST v1.1 are used to deﬁne target lesions and\nmeasure responses to systemic treatment [94]. The imaging as-\nsessment should be repeated every 3–12 weeks during treatment.\nReductions in serum Tg are expected in responders, but clinical\ndecisions cannot be based on this parameter alone.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Lenvatinib and sorafenib should be\nconsidered the standard ﬁrst-line systemic therapy for RAI-\nrefractory DTC [I, A; ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 scores: 3 for lenvatinib, 2 for sorafenib].\nLenvatinib and sorafenib have been approved by the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) and the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration\n(FDA)\nfor\nprogressive,\nmetastatic,\nRAI-\nrefractory DTC. Both drugs have been investigated in two large,\nrandomised phase III trials (sorafenib in DECISION [96], lenva-\ntinib in SELECT [97]). Head-to-head comparisons of the two\nagents have not been undertaken. They cannot be compared\nbased on their performances in the RCTs cited above, which dif-\nfered substantially in terms of enrolment criteria. Unlike the\nDECISION population, participants in SELECT underwent man-\ndatory assessment of radiological disease progression at entry by\nan independent committee, and pre-treated patients were not\nexcluded. In addition, progression-free survival (PFS) in the pla-\ncebo arm of SELECT was shorter than that of DECISION, which\nalso suggests that the SELECT trial population may have had\nmore advanced or more active disease than that of the\nDECISION study.\nIn the DECISION trial, 417 patients were randomised (1 : 1)\nto treatment with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo,\nwith crossover permitted at disease progression [96]. The study\ndemonstrated that sorafenib signiﬁcantly prolongs PFS [me-\ndian PFS (mPFS) 10.8 versus 5.8 months with placebo, hazard\nratio (HR) 0.59, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.45–0.76,\nP ¼ 0.001]. Objective responses (all partial) occurred in 12% of\nthe sorafenib group and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients\n(P < 0.0001). The median response duration was 10.2 months\n(95% CI 7.4–16.6). Stable disease lasting \u00036 months (post hoc\nanalysis) was observed more frequently with sorafenib (82/196\npatients, 41.8% versus 67/202 patients, 33.2% in the placebo\ngroup). Disease control (partial response or disease stability\nlasting \u00036 months; post hoc analysis) was achieved in 106/196\npatients (54.1%) treated with sorafenib and 33.8% (68/201\npatients) of those receiving placebo (P < 0.0001). Most patients\n(71.4%) receiving placebo crossed over to sorafenib, and 20.3%\nof patients in sorafenib arm and 8.6% of patients in placebo\narm received additional therapies. OS was similar in the two\narms (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54–1.19, P ¼ 0.14), and the median\nOS (mOS) had not been reached at the data cut-off (31 August\n2012). The median durations of treatment were 10.6 months\n(interquartile range 5.3–15.7) with sorafenib and 6.5 months\n(3.3–12.9) with placebo.\nIn the SELECT trial, 392 patients were randomised 2 : 1 to re-\nceive lenvatinib or placebo [97]. The study met the primary aim,\ndemonstrating that lenvatinib signiﬁcantly prolonged PFS com-\npared with placebo, as ﬁrst-line therapy (mPFS 18.3 versus\n3.6 months in the placebo arm, HR 0.21, 99% CI 0.14–0.31,\nP < 0.001) and in pre-treated patients (mPFS 15.1 months). The\n6-month PFS rates were 77.5% (lenvatinib group) and 25.4%\n(placebo group).

Previous\nMKI therapy is not a contraindication for subsequent use of\nthese drugs, but data on second-line efﬁcacy are scarce [II, C].\nMKIs should be continued until the disease progresses, un-\nacceptable toxicities occur or the patient asks to stop treatment.\nIn the presence of single-site progression, locoregional treatment\n(e.g. EBRT, embolisation, percutaneous treatment modalities)\ncan be done for local control, without discontinuing MKIs [V,\nC]. Data on real life experiences with lenvatinib in DTC patients\nare now available and as expected, the drug’s efﬁcacy was not as\ngood as that observed in highly selected RCT populations [100,\n101]. Other antiangiogenic agents have been tested as ﬁrst-line\ntherapy in phase II trials, with widely varying response rates\n(Table 6) [102–110]. None of these agents has been approved yet\nfor RAI-resistant DTC. MKIs with speciﬁc targets [e.g. BRAF,\ntropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK)] have also been used.\nVemurafenib has reportedly displayed activity against BRAF\nV600E TCs in both MKI-naive [overall response rate (ORR)\n38.5%, 95% CI 20.2–59.4] and pre-treated patients (ORR 27.3%,\n95% CI 10.7–50.2) [81, 111]. Larotrectinib has been recently\napproved by the FDA and the EMA for all paediatric and adult\ncancers expressing the TRK gene fusion protein. Partial\nresponses were observed in all ﬁve TC patients treated with this\ndrug in a recently reported phase I/II trial [112]. There is a bio-\nlogical rationale for treating advanced TCs with antiangiogenetic\nagents plus immune checkpoint inhibitors [113], and an RCT is\ncurrently underway to assess the activity of lenvatinib plus pem-\nbrolizumab in this setting (NCT02973997).\nAEs of MKIs: AEs occurred in 98.6% of patients receiving sora-\nfenib during the DECISION trial [96]: hand–foot syndrome,\ndiarrhoea, alopaecia, rash or desquamation, fatigue, weight loss\nand hypertension were the most common. Serum TSH levels\nexceeding 0.5 mIU/ml were observed in 33.3% patients (69/207)\nin the sorafenib arm. TSH increases are a recognised AE of sorafe-\nnib and other MKIs, and levels should be checked monthly to en-\nsure that suppression is maintained.\nSerious AEs were documented in 37.2% (77/207) of the\nsorafenib-treated participants. Nine developed a second malig-\nnancy: squamous-cell skin cancer in seven cases (one patient also\nhad melanoma), acute myeloid leukaemia and bladder cancer in\nthe remaining two cases. Skin cancer is a consequence of sorafe-\nnib’s paradoxical activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase\nsignalling in keratinocytes harbouring mutated or activated RAS.\nIn clinical practice, skin cancer can be resected surgically with\ncurative intent and sorafenib continued, but monitoring and\nearly intervention for skin lesions is essential. The high rate of\nAEs inevitably diminishes treatment compliance. In DECISION,\nwhere the mean daily dose was 651 mg, AEs frequently led to\ntreatment interruptions (137/207 patients, 66.2%), dose reduc-\ntions (133 patients, 64.3%) or drug withdrawals (39 patients,\n18.8%).\nIn SELECT, at least one side-effect also occurred in all\nlenvatinib-treated patients [114], the most common being hyper-\ntension, diarrhoea, fatigue, proteinuria, rash and hand–foot syn-\ndrome. Treatment interruptions (82.4% of patients) and dose\nreductions (67.8%) led to a mean daily lenvatinib dose of 17.2 mg\n[97]. AEs generally occurred during the ﬁrst few weeks of treat-\nment and decreased rapidly after treatment is interrupted. A trial\ncomparing lenvatinib starting doses of 24 versus 18 mg is current-\nly recruiting (NCT02657369). More selective agents such as laro-\ntrectinib for TRK fusion-positive cancers and highly selective\nRET inhibitors (e.g. LOXO 292, BLU 667) have better toxicity\nproﬁles. Off-target side-effects are uncommon with these drugs,\nand toxicities are mild and manageable, mostly of grades 1 and 2\n[112, 115].\nPhysicians, patients and caregivers should be aware of these\nAEs. Caught early, they can be effectively managed, but preven-\ntion, when feasible, is always advisable [116]. The aim should be\nto manage the side-effects successfully without resorting to dose\nor treatment schedule adjustments, which can have detrimental\neffects on treatment efﬁcacy. A post hoc analysis of the impact of\ndose interruption on lenvatinib efﬁcacy in SELECT trial partici-\npants revealed that longer interruptions and lower mean dose\nintensities may diminish the potential beneﬁt conferred by the\ndrug [117]. As MKIs may cause fatal harm when administered to\na pregnant woman and may result in reduced fertility in both\nsexes, fertility preservation approaches should be discussed be-\nfore treatment starts [118].\nConventional cytotoxic therapy: The results of chemotherapy\n(ChT) administration (e.g. doxorubicin) in RAI-refractory DTC\nare disappointing; therefore, it is not recommended unless MKI\ntherapy is contraindicated.\nATC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nATCs are very rare tumours that usually present at an advanced\nstage, display extremely aggressive behaviour, and are associated\nwith a very poor prognosis. They are morphologically heteroge-\nneous and must be distinguished from other neck tumours,\nincluding squamous carcinoma of the larynx, sarcomas and lym-\nphomas. Preoperative biopsy assessment includes diagnostic\nimmunomarkers that can differentiate ATC from large cell\nlymphoma or pleomorphic sarcoma. The molecular proﬁle of\nATC includes mutations of the TERT promoter (associated with\nBRAF or RAS mutations) and TP53 [21, 22], as well as targetable\nabnormalities (e.g. NTRK and ALK rearrangements).\nStaging and risk assessment\nIn the eighth edition of the UICC TNM staging system [23], diag-\nnosis of ATC is no longer associated with pT4 stage by default.\nCases treated with resection are staged like other TC histotypes,\nbased on tumour size and extension (Table 2).\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1869\n\n---\nATCs are considered one of the most aggressive solid tumours\nin humans. The median survival after the initial diagnosis is\n\u00054 months and only one out of ﬁve patients survives more than\n12 months (1-year survival rates: 10%–20%). Long-term survival\nhas been reported, but the estimated rate at 10 years is <5%. The\ndismal prognosis stems from the fact that over 40% of the\npatients present at diagnosis with large primary tumours (mean\nsize: 6 cm), gross extrathyroidal extension and locoregional and\ndistant metastases, which make complete resection unlikely\n[119]. A thorough imaging work-up should be carried out soon\nafter the diagnosis. The FDG–PET-CT scan is the most sensitive\ntool for documenting the extent of disease. Scans should be\nrepeated at all stages of treatment [120].\nATC\nConﬁ rm diagnosis with histopathologya [V, A]\nResectable (R0/R1) with minimal morbidityc\nUnresectable/M1 disease\nMutated\nWild-type\nBest supportive \ncare [V, B]\nFully stage urgentlyb with cross-sectional imaging\nFDG–PET-CT useful for M1 disease [IV, A]\nFibreoptic analysis of airway and vocal cord function \n± endoscopic review of oesophageal invasion [IV, A]\nDiscussion in a multidisciplinary tumour board including palliative care [V, A]\nTT ± neck dissection [IV, A] \nIf R0/R1 and M0, \nconsider postoperative EBRT ± ChTd  \nas soon as possible post-surgerye [IV, A] \nDabrafenib + trametinib \n[V, B]\nClinical trials or palliative \nChTg [V, B]\nPalliative EBRT \n[V, B]\nFigure 5.

In the absence of druggable muta-\ntions, immunotherapy is an alternative approach. Ideally, these approaches should be tested within the context of a clinical trial.

ATC is rarely amenable to complete resection (Figure 5).\nTotal thyroidectomy with bilateral central neck dissection may be\ncarried out in those very rare cases of localised ATC in M0\npatients. Extensive resection with total laryngectomy, oesopha-\ngectomy and/or resection of the great vessels has been reported in\nhighly selected cases in specialised centres, but postoperative\nmortality and morbidity are high and there is no high-level evi-\ndence to indicate that this approach improves survival. The prog-\nnosis is also unaffected by incomplete palliative resection (R2) or\n‘debulking’, which is not generally recommended [IV, E] [121].\nTracheostomy may be needed to alleviate symptoms in patients\nwith moderately progressive disease, but the impact of tracheos-\ntomy on QoL must be considered. Given the technical complex-\nity, the procedure is generally done under general anaesthesia. An\nexperienced team of surgeons and anaesthesiologists is essential,\nas is a complete preoperative cross-sectional imaging assessment\nof the trachea and tumour.\nRadiotherapy. Optimal outcomes in terms of survival and local\ndisease control in ATC require complete or near-complete [no\nresidual tumour (R0) or microscopic residual tumour (R1)] re-\nsection followed by high-dose EBRT, with or without concomi-\ntant ChT [V, A] [122, 123]. However, this multimodal approach\ncan strongly impact QoL and should be reserved for carefully\nselected patients to ensure clinical beneﬁt. Timely discussion\nwithin a multidisciplinary team setting is strongly recommended\n[V, A] (Figure 5).\nAnalysis of 1200 ATC cases in a large national database [121]\nrevealed signiﬁcantly better outcomes when multimodality\ntherapy included radical surgery (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.28–0.43,\nP < 0.0001 versus no surgery or palliative surgery), 40 Gy of\nEBRT (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38–0.56, P < 0.0001 versus no ERBT\nor <40 Gy EBRT) and ChT of any type (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52–\n0.76, P < 0.0001 versus no ChT). Outcomes also varied with\nUICC stage. For stage IVA disease, the beneﬁt from additional\ntherapies was nonsigniﬁcant. For stage IVB disease, however,\nradical surgery followed by both EBRT and ChT signiﬁcantly\nimproved cause-speciﬁc survival compared with radical sur-\ngery alone or with EBRT (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25–0.81,\nP ¼ 0.0083).\nA meta-analysis of 17 retrospective studies including 1147\npatients looked at the impact of postoperative radiotherapy\n(PORT) after radical ATC resection and found that it signiﬁcant-\nly reduced the risk of death as compared with radical resection\nalone (HR 0.556, 95% CI 0.419–0.737, P < 0.001) [124].\nExploratory analyses demonstrated that PORT might also confer\na survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IVA (HR 0.364,\nP ¼ 0.012) or IVB (HR 0.460, P ¼ 0.059) disease but not for stage\nIVC. For best outcomes, PORT must be delivered as soon as pos-\nsible after surgery [IV, A], but the patient must have recovered\nfrom surgery sufﬁciently to be able to lie ﬂat and tolerate\nimmobilisation.\nBecause of the improved dose distribution and the ability to re-\nduce toxicity, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (RT) is the rec-\nommended approach [IV, C] [125]. There is some evidence of a\ndose–response relation. Outcomes in ATC are improved with\ndoses exceeding 45–50 Gy [126, 127]. An analysis of the United\nStates National Cancer Database showed maximal beneﬁts with\ndoses >60 Gy [128]. Evidence that hyperfractionated accelerated\nRT (i.e. delivery of two or more fractions per day over a shorter\ntreatment time) improved survival over that obtained with con-\nventional fractionation is insufﬁcient, whereas it was clearly asso-\nciated with increased toxicity [129–131].\nFor stage IVA or IVB disease, concomitant ChT (usually with\ndoxorubicin or a platinum agent) has been used. Most of the data\nreported on this approach came from single-institution series\nand the clinical beneﬁts reported have been variable. It has been\nshown that concomitant taxane therapy has radio-sensitising\neffects [132].\nPalliative EBRT: In patients with unresectable disease, EBRT\nhas a role in symptom control [V, C] [133]. The aim is usually to re-\nduce the rate of growth of the neck mass and thereby the pressure\nsymptoms. Fractionation schedules vary according to the individual\npatient (most commonly from 20Gy in ﬁve fractions to 30 Gy in 10\nfractions). These fractionation regimens allow simple beam\narrangements such as parallel opposed or simple three-dimensional\nconformal techniques, so that RT can be started as soon as possible.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. Novel systemic\ntherapies are urgently needed to improve the generally poor out-\ncomes associated with ATC. Clinical trial enrolment should\ntherefore be encouraged for patients with good clinical PS [V, B].\nFor patients ineligible for systemic treatments or clinical trials,\nbest supportive care should be discussed (Figure 5) [133].\nTo date, cytotoxic ChT has been the primary treatment for\nmetastatic disease, but it is associated with very low response rates\nand signiﬁcant toxicities [133]. Recommended regimens consist\nof single-agent therapy with paclitaxel or doxorubicin or com-\nbined treatments (e.g. carboplatin/paclitaxel, docetaxel/doxo-\nrubicin) administered weekly or every 3–4 weeks [134–136]. No\ndata are available to guide decisions on second-line therapy\n[133]. Chemoradiotherapy can be considered for local control of\nunresectable stage IVB disease, ideally with weekly administra-\ntion of radio-sensitising ChT (see above).\nSeveral novel approaches (targeted therapy, immunother-\napy) are being studied, alone or in combination, to improve\nthe poor response rates achieved with current strategies. The ef-\nﬁcacy of lenvatinib in ATC is controversial. In 2015, the\ndrug was approved by the Japanese regulatory agency for treat-\nment of TCs, including ATC, based on data from a single-arm,\nopen-label, phase II study conducted on a population of 51\npatients [137], 17 of whom had ATC. The primary aim was to\nestablish the drug’s safety in this setting. The ATC patients had\nan mPFS of 7.4 months (95% CI 1.7–12.9), an mOS of\n10.6 months (95% CI 3.8–19.8) and an objective response rate\nof 24%. These ﬁndings prompted an international, multi-\ncentre, phase II trial, but the trial was stopped early due to futil-\nity (NCT02657369).\nMolecular proﬁling studies have begun to elucidate the mo-\nlecular drivers and the multistep dedifferentiation associated\nwith ATC tumourigenesis [21, 22]. Early mutation of BRAF and\nRAS has been reported in 25% and 28% of the cases, respectively\n[138]. In a phase II, open-label basket trial, patients with BRAF\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1871\n\n---\nV600E-positive malignancies (including 16 with ATC) were\ntreated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily)\nplus the MEK inhibitor trametinib (2 mg once daily). The ORR\nwas 69% (11/16; 95% CI 41%–89%), and the treatment was well\ntolerated [139]. In May 2018, this combination received FDA\napproval for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic\nATC with the BRAF V600E mutation. If available, this should be\nthe ﬁrst-line therapy for advanced BRAF V600E ATC patients\n[V, B]. Other rare mutations and genetic aberrations may also\nprove to be druggable, such as ALK translocations [21, 22].\nExtended molecular proﬁling of ATCs should be strongly\nencouraged as it may reveal promising possibilities for targeted\ntherapies.\nIn the presence of non-druggable mutations, targeting the tu-\nmour microenvironment or common cancer signalling pathways\nis an alternative approach. ATC immunoproﬁling has revealed\nhigh numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes in the tumour\nand tumour cell expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-\nL1) [138]. Immunotherapy with antibodies targeting pro-\ngrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor or PD-L1 has produced\nimpressive results in many malignancies, but few data are avail-\nable on their use in ATC. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody\nspartalizumab was tested in 41 heavily pre-treated patients with\nadvanced ATC, and responses were observed in 19.5%, opening\nthe road to the use of immunotherapy in ATC [140].\nInclusion of targeted therapy, immunotherapy, ChT and/or\nRT,\nadministered\nin\ncombination\nor\nsequentially,\nin\nmultidisciplinary ATC management regimens may improve pa-\ntient outcomes (NCT03181100).\nMTC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nMTC is morphologically heterogeneous and can mimic virtually\nall other primary thyroid tumours. Demonstration of calcitonin\n(Ctn) expression is mandatory for the diagnosis. Rare primary\nCtn-negative neuroendocrine carcinomas of the thyroid exist\nand must be distinguished from metastases from neuroendo-\ncrine neoplasms of the lung. In these cases, carcinoembryonic\nantigen (CEA) determination can be useful, being the only neck\ntumour expressing this marker. The preoperative diagnosis\ncan also be challenging in the absence of a consistent\nimmunophenotype.\nRET and RAS proto-oncogene mutations are detected in\n\u000590% of MTCs and are considered the predominant drivers of\nthese tumours [141]. RET mutations occur sporadically, as som-\natic events, or can be inherited as germline events associated with\nfamilial MTC or the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes\ntype 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B). A quarter of MTCs occur\nas part of an inherited syndrome, and germline RET mutations\nare present in up to 10% of the patients presenting with apparent-\nly sporadic MTCs.

Strong genotype–phenotype associations\naffecting age at onset (most MTCs occur either in childhood or\nearly adulthood) and tumour aggressiveness have been reported\nfor speciﬁc germline RET mutations. MTCs harbouring somatic\nRET mutations are also commonly associated with more aggres-\nsive behaviour than that of their wild-type RET counterparts. The\nvast majority (91.4%) of sporadic MTCs with distant metastases\nharbour such mutations, in most cases RET M918T (93.8%)\n[144]. There is currently no evidence supporting the value of rou-\ntine screening of MTC patients for somatic RET mutations.\nHowever, if treatment of advanced MTCs with selective RET\ninhibitors is planned, RET testing for somatic mutations is\nneeded to individualise therapy [III, C].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe UICC system is recommended for staging all MTC patients,\nbased on its utility in predicting disease-speciﬁc mortality [IV, A]\n[23]. The eighth edition of this system has introduced some im-\nportant changes in the criteria used for staging thyroid tumours,\nincluding MTCs. Extrathyroidal extension, for example, is now\nimportant only when it is macroscopically evident (pT3b) [23].\nIn the absence of gross extracapsular extension, the primary will\nbe staged solely on the basis of its size (pT1, pT2 or pT3a)\n(Table 2).\nCtn and CEA are valuable diagnostic, prognostic and predict-\nive markers for use with MTC. Their serum concentrations are\ndirectly related to the C-cell mass [145, 146]. Preoperative Ctn\nlevels correlate strongly with tumour diameter and postoperative\nCtn levels. They can also provide useful preoperative information\non the extent of the disease. An analysis of 300 consecutive cases\nof MTC treated with total thyroidectomy and compartment-\noriented lymph node dissections found that preoperative serum\nCtn levels <20 pg/ml (normal reference range: <10 pg/ml) were\nassociated with almost no risk of nodal metastases [147].

Preoperative screening for pheochromocytoma and\nhyperparathyroidism is highly recommended for all patients with\nMTC (except in those already known to have MEN2B) [IV, A]\n[142, 143]. Neck US should be carried out to identify regional\nmetastases; if sonographic (or clinical) ﬁndings are suspicious,\ncontrast-enhanced CT of the neck and chest is indicated. Work-\nup for distant metastases, including chest CT, liver and axial bone\nMRI and 6-ﬂuoro-(18F)-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA)-\nPET scan (if available), should be done if serum Ctn levels exceed\n500 pg/ml or clinical ﬁndings are suspicious. Neck dissection,\nwhen needed, should be done by surgeons with substantial ex-\nperience in TC surgery. The initial approach will depend on pre-\noperative serum Ctn levels and neck imaging ﬁndings (Figure 6)\n[IV, B]. The guidelines in the algorithm are based on retrospect-\nive cohort studies [147, 152]. The grade B recommendation is\nbased on the clinical beneﬁts of elective neck dissection in\npatients with serum Ctn levels <500 pg/ml, for whom surgery\nmay be curative.\nFor carriers of germline mutations, the recommended age for\nprophylactic total thyroidectomy depends on the type of muta-\ntion. Individuals with germline M918T mutations should under-\ngo total thyroidectomy within the ﬁrst year of life. For those with\na C634F or A883F mutation (also considered high risk), surgery\ncan be postponed until age 5 unless Ctn levels increase. Those\nwith other mutations should be monitored from age 5 on with\nCtn assays and neck US, and surgery should be done if Ctn levels\nincrease or if the parents request it [143].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nCtn and CEA monitoring should both be included in the early\nand long-term postoperative staging work-ups [IV, B] [150].\nSerial measurements allow the calculation of doubling times,\nwhich provide useful information as described above. Currently\navailable data indicate that Ctn doubling times should be based\non at least four consecutive measurements, preferably obtained\nover a 2-year period [IV, C] [142, 143]. All measurements must\nbe made by the same laboratory using the same assay. The ATA\nprovides an online calculator for rapid determination of doubling\ntimes from user-supplied series of serum Ctn or serum CEA levels\n[153]. Figure 7 summarises MTC management strategies guided\nby Ctn and CEA levels and doubling times. Clinically relevant dis-\nease sites are rarely detected in patients with Ctn levels <150 pg/\nml, but the likelihood of structural disease increases as Ctn and\nCEA levels rise.\nMultiple imaging modalities should be used to identify locore-\ngional and/or distant metastases [IV, B] [142, 143]. Contrast-\nenhanced whole-body (brain, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis)\nCT with ultra-thin reconstructions is sensitive and speciﬁc\nenough to allow one to estimate the burden of systemic disease\nand to assess and identify target lesions. Target and non-target\nlesions to assess are measured using RECIST v1.1 [94]. Contrast-\nenhanced MRI is more sensitive in identifying liver lesions, which\ncan be misdiagnosed on CT or US as benign cystic lesions. US is\nuseful for assessing neck lymph node involvement, although, as\nmentioned before, it sometimes provides inadequate visualisa-\ntion of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by bone\nor air. For these structures, CT and MRI are more sensitive, pro-\nvide greater morphological detail, and are recommended when\nsurgical interventions, EBRT or other locoregional ablative\napproaches are being planned. MRI is recommended for identify-\ning or excluding brain metastases. Bone scans in MTC patients\nare high in sensitivity but low in speciﬁcity. Whole-body\nbone MRI without contrast medium offers higher speciﬁcity,\nparticularly for osteoblastic lesions. Contrast enhancement is\nrecommended when extraosseous extension or compression\nof the spinal cord or other neurological structures is suspected.\nEndoscopic exploration of the upper digestive tract and\nairways is mandatory whenever there is a high suspicion of\ninﬁltration.\nAs indolent tumours, MTCs generally display low avidity for\nFDG, so FDG–PET–CT is not recommended for their staging,\nbut it can be useful for assessing advanced disease characterised\nby dedifferentiation and rapid progression [151]. FDOPA–PET\nhas high sensitivity and speciﬁcity in MTC [154, 155] and it can\nreveal unidentiﬁed metastases or small lesions, but cost and avail-\nability issues make it unsuitable. Gallium-68 (68Ga) somatostatin\nanalogue PET–CT is relatively insensitive and is not useful for\nstaging, but it does reﬂect expression of somatostatin receptors,\nwhich is useful information when the feasibility of radionuclide\ntherapy is being explored [156].\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1874 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nTable 7.

Disease behaviour varies widely—indolent\nin some cases, rapidly progressive in others—and can be reliably\npredicted by Ctn and CEA doubling times. Advanced MTCs are\ninvariably associated with the secretion of a variety of peptides\n(e.g. prostaglandins, kinins, vasoactive intestinal peptide, sero-\ntonin, histaminase), which can cause unpleasant symptoms such\nas ﬂushing and diarrhoea. Management of these symptoms\nshould be the ﬁrst goal of treatment.\nThe systemic therapies currently approved for MTC have not\nbeen shown to improve OS, so evidence-based guidance is lacking\non when to start these drugs and how patients with indolent\ndisease should be followed. Decisions are based mainly on clini-\ncians’ experience. Multidisciplinary input (e.g. from surgeons,\nendocrinologists, nuclear medicine physicians, medical and radi-\nation oncologists, pain therapists and palliative care specialists) is\nstrongly recommended to ensure optimal care for these patients.\nActive treatment (e.g. locoregional or systemic MKI administra-\ntion) should be considered in the presence of symptoms, lesions\nclose to vital structures, high-tumour burdens or disease progres-\nsion (as deﬁned by RECIST v1.1) [94].\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Cabozantinib [I, A] and vandetanib\n[I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] are the ﬁrst-line systemic treat-\nments for progressive metastatic MTC.

Both drugs inhibit RET kinase activity\nto some extent, and this was the major reason they were originally\nproposed for treating MTC patients. However, their antitumour\neffect is mainly due to their strong inhibition of key angiogenic\npathway components, including vascular endothelial growth fac-\ntor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2).\nThe ZETA trial compared vandetanib (300 mg daily) with pla-\ncebo (2 : 1) in 331 patients with symptomatic and/or metastatic\nMTC [158]. Radiological evidence of disease progression was not\nan enrolment requirement, and placebo-to-vandetanib crossover\nwas allowed if disease progression occurred. The predicted mPFS\nin the vandetanib arm was signiﬁcantly longer than that observed\nin the placebo group (30.5 versus 19.3 months; HR 0.46, 95% CI\n0.31–0.69, P < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the vandetanib\narm (45% versus 13% for placebo, OR 5.48, 95% CI 2.99–10.79,\nP < 0.001), and all but one of the responses in the placebo arm\nwere recorded after crossover to vandetanib. Radiological\nresponses\nwere\naccompanied\nby\nsigniﬁcant\nbiochemical\nresponses (reductions in Ctn and CEA levels in 69% and 52% of\ncases, respectively). Vandetanib exhibited activity independently\nof the tumour’s RET status, previous treatment, metastasis\nsite(s), disease progression status and tumour burden. When the\nZETA data were ﬁrst published, no survival advantage was\nreported for patients managed with vandetanib and no updates\nhave been published since then. In a phase I/II trial of vandetanib\nin children with MTC (two courses at 100 mg/day, then 150 mg/\nday), partial responses were seen in 47% patients, and the AE pro-\nﬁle resembled that observed in adults [160].\nIn the EXAM trial, cabozantinib (140 mg daily) was tested\nagainst placebo (2 : 1) in 330 patients with metastatic MTC [159].\nThe main inclusion criterion was disease progression within the\n14 months preceding study entry. Prior therapy, including MKIs,\nwas allowed, and crossover was not permitted. Compared with\nplacebo, cabozantinib was associated with a signiﬁcantly longer\nmPFS (11.2 versus 4.0 months, HR 0.28, 95% CI, 0.19–0.40,\nP < 0.001) and a higher rate of responses (all partial) (28% versus\n0%, median duration 14.7 months). Efﬁcacy was observed across\nall subgroups, regardless of age, tumour location, tumour bur-\nden, progression rate, prior kinase inhibitor treatment (in 20% of\npatients) or RET/RAS mutation status. mOS rates were similar in\nthe two arms (26.6 versus 21.1 months, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64–\n1.12, P ¼ 0.024), but in the subgroup with RETM918T-positive\nMTCs, cabozantinib was associated with signiﬁcantly longer sur-\nvival (44.3 versus 18.9 months with placebo, HR 0.60, 95% CI\n0.38–0.94, P ¼ 0.03). PFS was consistent with OS in the\nRETM918T-positive\ncases\n(HR\n0.15,\n95%\nCI\n0.08–0.28,\nP < 0.0001) [161].\nAlthough the ZETA and EXAM trials both focused on patients\nwith advanced and/or metastatic disease, their designs and inclu-\nsion criteria were different. The markedly longer mPFS in the pla-\ncebo arm of the ZETA trial—19.3 months [158] versus 4 months\nin EXAM [159]—suggests population differences. Indeed, unlike\nZETA participants, those enrolled in EXAM had to meet RECIST\ncriteria for disease progression and were thus likely to have more\nadvanced disease. The results of the two trials are therefore not\ncomparable, and there is no clear evidence supporting vandetanib\nover cabozantinib as ﬁrst-line treatment. Both are active in ﬁrst-\nand second-line regimens, both prolonged PFS compared with\nplacebo and both displayed RET/RAS status-independent efﬁ-\ncacy. The choice of which drug to use as ﬁrst-line treatment may\nbe based on potential toxicity in each patient (see below).\nHowever, cabozantinib, in a subgroup analysis, demonstrated a\nsigniﬁcant advantage in PFS and OS in patients with RETM918T\nor RAS-mutant MTCs [II, C] [161]. As noted for lenvatinib, re-\ncently released real world data on the efﬁcacy of vandetanib in\nMTC patients are somewhat less encouraging than those gener-\nated in the highly selected population of RCTs [162].\nOther anti-angiogenic MKIs (e.g. sorafenib, motesanib, pazo-\npanib, sunitinib, lenvatinib) have already undergone phase II\ntesting in advanced MTC patients. The most interesting results\nregarded sunitinib and lenvatinib, which were associated with\nresponse rates of 50% and 36%, respectively [157]. Thus far,\nhowever, no MKIs have been approved for second-line use. A\nrandomised trial assessing the efﬁcacy of nintedanib as second-\nline MKI therapy was prematurely closed due to ﬂat enrolment\n(NCT01788982). The more selective RET inhibitors (e.g.\nLOXO-292-NCT03157128,\nBLU-667-NCT03037385)\nappear\npromising and are now under investigation. The RET-\nsuppressing activity of these drugs is essential to their antitu-\nmour effects in MTC, whereas their anti-angiogenic activity is\nnegligible.\nManagement of side-effects: AEs are very common during MKI\ntherapy, and their management is critical for optimising these\ncompounds’ therapeutic ratios. In the ZETA trial, 35% of the\npatients in the vandetanib arm required dose reductions and 12%\ndiscontinued treatment due to toxicity [158]. The most common\nTable 9.

Corrected QT interval\n(QTc) prolongation was a severe, unexpected side-effect in 8% of\ncases. Attempts to reduce the rate of grade 2 or higher AEs with\nan active support programme (including patient contact/visit\nevery 2 weeks and supportive agents such as sunscreen and lo-\nperamide) have been unsuccessful [163]. AEs were also common\nin the EXAM trial, with grade 3 or 4 AEs in 69% of patients\nreceiving cabozantinib. The most common were diarrhoea\n(15.9%), hand–foot syndrome (12.6%) and fatigue (9.3%). Pre-\nexisting disease-related diarrhoea can be worsened by MKI ther-\napy (as a drug-related AE) or improved as a direct effect of the\ndrug’s activity. Increased TSH levels were reported in 57% of the\ncabozantinib-treated patients. TSH levels should be monitored\ncontinuously during treatment, as these patients are generally on\nhormone-replacement therapy if they have undergone total thy-\nroidectomy. Levels should be kept within the normal range: TSH\nsuppression produces no beneﬁts in patients with MTC (unlike\nthose with DTC). AEs associated with VEGF-pathway inhibition\n(e.g. hypertension, haemorrhage, ﬁstula formation, gastrointes-\ntinal\nperforation)\noccurred\nmore\nfrequently\namong\ncabozantinib-treated patients than in those treated with placebo.\nIn the EXAM trial, 79% of patients in the cabozantinib arm\nhad dose reductions, 65% interrupted treatment due to AEs, and\n16% stopped treatment because of toxicities. Randomised trials\nare underway to assess the activities of lower, potentially less\ntoxic doses of vandetanib (150 versus 300 mg, NCT01496313)\nand\ncabozantinib\n(140 mg\ncapsules\nversus\n60 mg\npills,\nNCT01896479).\nThe preliminary results comparing the effects of the two doses\nof vandetanib in patients with advanced MTC have been posted\non ClinicalTrials.gov and showed that the starting dose of 150 mg\nis equally effective as the high 300 mg dose in term of ORR.\nInterruption of treatment and dose reductions are the most\ncommon means for managing AEs. Most decrease in intensity\nafter a few days of withdrawal, but vandetanib AEs may be more\npersistent, given the drug’s 19-day half-life. However, frequent\ninterruptions might reduce the efﬁcacy of MKIs and/or trigger\ncertain escape mechanisms. Most AEs (e.g. hypertension, diar-\nrhoea) are well known and preventable. Useful guidelines for pre-\nventing and managing treatment-related AEs in these complex\ncases have been published by several societies. As for fertility pres-\nervation, the same measures taken for DTC patients are valid for\nthose with MTC.\nConventional\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nradionuclide\ntherapy:\nSystemically administered ChT has historically yielded poor\nresults in MTC. The available data have been generated by retro-\nspective analyses of small, single-institution cases series. The\nmost active drugs have been doxorubicin alone or combined with\ncisplatin, which achieved a response in around 20% at best, or as\na combination with 5-ﬂuorouracil and dacarbazine which did\nnot result in much greater responses [157].\nRadionuclide therapy is an option in selected cases [III, C]. The\nactivity of yttrium-90–DOTA-[D-Phe1-Tyr3]-octreotide (90Y-\nDOTATOC) was tested in a phase II trial including 31 patients\nwith metastatic MTC and increasing Ctn levels. Post-treatment\ndecreases in Ctn levels (the primary endpoint) occurred in 29%\nof the patients treated, and survival beneﬁts were also observed in\nthe responders [164]. RCTs have not been carried out to compare\nthe efﬁcacies of radionuclide and MKI therapies. Ideally, this\ncomparison should be done within a clinical trial setting. In short,\nthere is little evidence to support the use of either ChT or radio-\nnuclide therapy in patients with MTC, although either might be\nconsidered when MKIs are contraindicated.\nMethodology\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in accordance\nwith the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical\nPractice\nGuidelines\ndevelopment,\nhttp://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology.

Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may\nsecrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF\nto functional status.10\nRecommendation\n\u0002 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,\ngrading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and\nsynaptophysin should be reported. SSTR staining or spe-\nciﬁc staining for peptide hormones and amines as well as\nuse of molecular markers is optional and dependent on\nclinical requirements [III, A].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nDisease stage and tumour grade are the two major indepen-\ndent prognostic parameters and should always be assessed\n[III, A]. Since the WHO 2010 classiﬁcation, NENs are graded\nTable 1.

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs. FDG is the tracer of choice\nfor G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose\nmetabolism and less SSTR expression than the low-grade\nNETs, for which the situation is usually the reverse.29 Com-\nbined SSTR imaging and FDG-PET-CT has been shown to be\ncomplementary for lesion detection. Findings of FDG-\npositive NETs at PET-CT indicate worse prognosis.29e31\nThe author panel believes that optimal diagnostic and\nprognostic information can be achieved by submitting all\nNET G2/G3 patients to PET-CT with both FDG and 68Ga-\nTable 3.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic\nradical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph\nnodes can be achieved in \u000480% of cases if carried out by\nexperienced surgeons.40\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locore-\ngional\ndisease\nin\nNET\nG1\nand\nG2.\nBefore\nany\nFigure 2.

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].

However, in aggressive NENs (NEC\nG3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy\n(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are\nwarranted.\nMedical therapy\nThe goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-\nassociated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].\nTreatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-\ntide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning\nNETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved\nin 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations\n[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also\nnamed biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in\nNETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the\nmultiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been\nintroduced more recently in the management of NETs.

The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48]. There was a beneﬁt in terms of PFS prolon-\ngation in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56 (0.37e0.8)] and the\nlung NET subgroup [HR 0.5 (0.28e0.88)], and everolimus is\nEMA-approved for NF-GI and lung NETs. Everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive GI NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%). Other side-effects include\nhypertension (26%), lymphopaenia (26%) and hair colour\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.\nThe stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.\nA watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

The NETTER-2 trial has recently been\ninitiated to address this issue (NCT03972488).\nTreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE is in general considered\nsafe, however, up to 3%e4% of the patients may develop\nirreversible bone marrow toxicity such as leukaemia or bone\nmarrow dysplasia. Mild renal toxicity grade 1/2 has been re-\nported long term in 30% of the patients (see Section 5 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline).\nFor more information about PRRT and SSA combination\nand maintenance therapy, see Section 6 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 A surgical approach is indicated in selected patients\naffected by stage IV GEP-NETs who show exclusive or pre-\ndominant liver disease after careful evaluation of tumour\ngrading, distribution of LMs and primary site [IV, B].\n\u0002 Upfront surgery is not indicated in the presence of extra-\nabdominal metastases and high-grade GEP-NENs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Presence of an advanced NEC G3 is considered an abso-\nlute contraindication for an upfront surgery [IV, A].\n\u0002 Palliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV,\nC]. However, it is controversial if primary tumour\nremoval in patients with stage IV disease translates to\nan improvement in survival.\n\u0002 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-\ntoms in patients affected by metastatic functioning\nSI-NETs [IV, B].\n\u0002 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms\nrelated to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery\nmay be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered\nin patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].\n\u0002 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].\n\u0002 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].\nHowever, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy\nwith platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].\n\u0002 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid\noptions for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with\nother systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.\nThe choice of the procedures depends on the local\nexpertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and\nthe localisation of liver involvement [V, C].\n\u0002 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be\napplied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve\ncontrol of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-\ntions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)\n[IV, A].\n\u0002 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,\nlocoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-\ntive to systemic treatment [IV, B].\n\u0002 Systemic therapy should be administered to control\ntumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth\n[I, A].\n\u0002 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients\nwith CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,\nglucagonoma) [I, A].\n\u0002 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-\ntristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-\nment to SSAs [I, A].\n\u0002 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve\nsymptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of\nIFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].\n\u0002 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].\n\u0002 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires\ncareful information to be given to the patient before and\ndirectly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper\ntreatment [IV, A].\n\u0002 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on\npathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth\nbehaviour and SSTR imaging.\n\u0002 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients\nwith low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable\ndisease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term\nfavourable prognosis.\n\u0002 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for\ntumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing\nSSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,\nA; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide.

Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence. NSE and\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be monitored in NEC;\nAnnals of Oncology\nM. Pavel et al.\n856\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.304\nVolume 31\n- Issue 7\n- 2020\n\n---\nCgA may also be elevated in NET G3. Conventional imaging\nincludes thoracic and abdominal scans every 2e3 months.\nFDG-PET may be required in case of suspected recurrence to\ndiscriminate lesions from unspeciﬁc ﬁndings; otherwise,\nhigh-resolution CT is the imaging method of choice, unless\nresection is considered in locally advanced NEN G3,\nwhere FDG-PET is mandatory to exclude distant metastatic\ndisease.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional\nand SSTR imaging [V, B].\n\u0002 In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1eG2, it is recom-\nmended that imaging is carried out every 3e6 months\n(CT or MRI), and in NEC G3 every 2e3 months [V, C].\nSimilar staging intervals apply to advanced disease.\n\u0002 Follow-up should be lifelong, although the staging inter-\nvals may be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up.\n\u0002 Small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix or rectum do not need any follow-up if\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in\naccordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures\nfor Clinical Practice Guidelines development, http://www.\nesmo.org/Guidelines/ESMOGuidelines-Methodology.\nThe\nrelevant literature has been selected by the expert authors.\nAn ESMO-MCBS table with ESMO-MCBS scores is included\nin supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.107 Levels of evidence and grades of recommenda-\ntion have been applied using the system shown in\nsupplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.108 Statements without grading were considered\njustiﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts and the\nESMO Faculty.

Patients with carcinoids are generally\nyounger, have a better prognosis and do not have a strong\nassociation with smoking, as compared with SCLC and\nLCNEC.1 The incidence of LC is very low, ranging from 0.2-2/\n100 000 persons/year in both the United States and\nEurope.2,3 Numbers are increasing, likely due to increased\nawareness and improved diagnostic techniques, although it\nmay also be a genuine overall increase in incidence.2,3 LCs\naccount for 20%-25% of all NETs and 1%-2% of all lung\ncancers. LCs prevail slightly more often in women than in\nmen. LCs occur during the ﬁfth or sixth decade of life for TC\nand a decade later for AC.4-10\nThC is an extremely rare tumour accounting for an age-\nadjusted rate of 0.02/100 000-0.18/100 000/year in the\nEuropean or USA populations, respectively.3,11 In the\nNetherlands cancer registry or the Surveillance, Epidemi-\nology and End Results (SEER) programme database, <0.5%\nof all neuroendocrine neoplasms were ThC, representing 5%\nof thymic tumours.3,11 The incidence of ThC is increasing in\nthe USA population.11 ThC prevails in men and the mean\nage at diagnosis is 55 years.1,11-13\nLC and ThC may also be present in multiple endocrine\nneoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome or when there is a\nfamily history of carcinoid tumours or diffuse pulmonary\nneuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) (Supplementary\nMaterial,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2021.01.003).1,14-17\nRecommendation\n\u0001 The scarcity of LCs and ThCs justiﬁes the therapeutic\nmanagement of these patients by expert multidisci-\nplinary teams in centres grouped within networks (na-\ntional or European networks) for care and research\noptimisation [V, A].\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nLC is revealed by non-speciﬁc tumour-related respiratory\nsymptoms (mainly, central forms) or incidentally (mainly,\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Note: Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last\nupdate December 2020.

A minority of cases present with symp-\ntoms related to hormonal hypersecretion, including carci-\nnoid syndrome (CS), due to serotonin and other compound\nsecretions, Cushing’s syndrome (CuS), due to adrenocorti-\ncotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion and acromegaly, due to\ngrowth\nhormone-releasing\nhormone\n(GHRH)\nsecre-\ntion.5,7,18,19 In a recent large population-based study series\nof 3002 LC patients, CS was present in 229 patients (7.6%)\nat diagnosis.20\nDiagnosis is carried out with bronchoscopic technique,\ntransthoracic biopsy or, less frequently, by mediastinoscopy\nor\nendobronchial\nendoscopic\nultrasonography\n(EBUS)\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).\nSurgery may be carried out upfront after adequate\nmedical\npreparation\nin\nlocalised\nresectable\ntumours\nresembling LCs or in tumours considered at high risk of\nbleeding or hormonal crisis or when previous biopsy has\nfailed. Once the diagnosis is suspected, standardised char-\nacterisation of LC comprises several speciﬁc steps for eval-\nuation that are described in Table 1 [III, B].4-9,18,20-34\nThC is revealed by tumour-related symptoms, or due to\nfunctionally active tumours or by chance.11-13 Diagnostic\nprocedures, including core biopsy under ultrasonography\nguidance, or preferably through a thoracic computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) scan, or upfront surgery following the guidelines for\nthymic tumour diagnosis, should be carried out.35 The authors\nrecommend standardised characterisation of ThC in multidis-\nciplinary expert centres as described in Table 1 [III, B].11,12,32-37\nThe histopathological diagnosis of LC or ThC relies on\ncharacteristic morphological features and on the demon-\nstration of the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour through\nthe immunodetection of a panel of markers including at least\nchromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin, which are usually\nexpressed in all carcinoids. This might be expanded to other\nmarkers such as CD56.1 Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1)\nmay be useful in well-differentiated tumours only, when\npositive, to suggest the lung origin of metastatic tumours.1\nTCs and ACs are distinguished (Supplementary Table S1,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003),\non the basis of mitotic count and presence or absence of\nnecrosis.1 While Ki-67 index is not included in the WHO\ncriteria, the WHO acknowledges that Ki-67 index might be\nuseful for the differential diagnosis between well- or poorly-\ndifferentiated NETs (Supplementary Table S1, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).1 Carcinoids\nare characterised by mutations involving either MEN-1 or\nother genes encoding chromatin-remodelling proteins.38,39\nTP53 and particularly RB1 gene alterations, which are rare\nmolecular events in carcinoids, might be potential tools to\ndiscriminate between well or poorly differentiated categories\nin difﬁcult cases like the recently identiﬁed LC with high\nproliferative features. This new subgroup is deﬁned by a\nmitotic count >10 and/or a Ki-67 index >20%, and a well-\ndifferentiated morphology (Supplementary Table S2, avail-\nable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).39-43\nThe ratio between TC and AC is about 6 : 10 in surgical se-\nries but may be closer to 1 : 1 in advanced cases.1,4,6,7,20\nThe ThC WHO classiﬁcation is identical to that of lung\nNETs with four categories including TC or AC deﬁned using\nthe same criteria (Supplementary Table S1, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003). The pattern\nof genetic alterations is different from LC.1,38 As for LCs, a\nsubgroup of ThC with high proliferative features has\nrecently been recognised.44 The ratio between atypical and\ntypical ThC is about 2 : 1.1,33,34,36\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Management of LC and ThC requires a multidisciplinary\nstandardised approach in specialised centres [IV, A]\n\u0001 Ki-67 (MIB 1) [IV, A], TTF1 [IV, B], p53/RB1 [IV, B]\nbiomarker analyses are recommended in selected cases\nfor differential diagnosis or site of origin orientation.\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nRisk assessments depend on pathology and TNM (tumoure\nnodeemetastasis) staging based on the combination of\nTable 1.

Insufﬁcient accuracy of CgA (30%-\n60% at the metastatic stage) makes research on new\nbiomarkers critical. Among these, a multianalyte molecular\nassay [51 transcripts; neuroendocrine tumor test (NETest)]\nis currently under development with potentially better\nsensitivity, but uncertainties remain regarding its positive\npredictive value and role as a prognostic marker for LC.22\nThe application of the 8th Edition of the Union for\nInternational\nCancer\nControl\n(UICC)\nTNM\nstaging\n(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) is recommended even\nif not speciﬁc to LCs.31,46,47 More than 80% of LCs are\ndiagnosed at TNM stage I or II.4,5-7,46 The most common\nsites of metastasis include liver, bone and lung. The diversity\nof metastatic sites and the potential overestimation of lung\nmetastasis and underestimation of brain metastasis must be\ntaken into account.46,47 The WHO classiﬁcation and patho-\nlogical TNM (pTNM) staging are intricate.5,21,48 In a recent\nstudy in which patients underwent \u000310 lymph node\nresection, frequency of positive lymph nodes was 17%\n(including 6% N2-N3) or 46% (including 23% N2-N3) in case\nof TC or AC, respectively.48\nMost ThCs are diagnosed at advanced-stage Masaokae\nKoga (Supplementary Table S5, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) or TNM stage III or\nIV.11,12,32 The most common sites for metastases include the\npleura, pericardium, bone, lung and liver.\nIn LCs, overall survival (OS) is mainly inﬂuenced by WHO\npathology and the pTNM classiﬁcations.1,5,21,45-49 In stage I,\nII, III or IV LC patients, 10-year disease-speciﬁc survival is\n96%, 85%, 81%, 59% and 88%, 75%, 47%, 18%, in TC or AC,\nrespectively, showing the major prognostic inﬂuence of the\nWHO classiﬁcation.46\nAfter resection, WHO classiﬁcation and pathological lymph\nnode staging (pN) status constitute the two main prognostic\nparameters (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).4,5,9,21,45,48-51\nAlthough\nKi-67 index is considered a promising prognostic marker by\nthe whole author panel, its technique of evaluation and the\nmost accurate thresholds remain a matter of debate; more-\nover, no deﬁnitive validation of its added value to WHO and\npTNM classiﬁcations has been provided so far in large series\nof LCs.18,28,45,52,53 At the metastatic stage, WHO classiﬁcation,\nperformance status, CgA levels, tumour burden and so-\nmatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) uptake, as well as tumour\ngrowth slope and the functioning syndrome, should be taken\ninto account for adequate risk assessment [IV, B].47 Prolonged\nsurvival of the majority of patients with LCs (including a 60%\n5-year OS for metastatic LC) makes adjusted toxicity proﬁle of\ntherapeutic interventions critical [V, A].47\nThe prognosis of patients with thymic NETs remains poor:\nin retrospective series, 5- or 10-year OS was 28%-72% or\n26%-60%, respectively.11-14,33 Based on a few large, retro-\nspective thymic NETs series, OS is inﬂuenced by stage,\nmainly\ntumour\nsize\nand\ncompleteness\nof\nresection\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).11-13,32,33,36 No speciﬁc staging\nsystem has yet been validated for ThC. The authors there-\nfore recommend the use of both staging systems (TNM,\nMasaokaeKoga) together with the WHO classiﬁcation and\nresection status for adequate prognostic stratiﬁcation.1\nRecommendations\n\u0001 WHO and pTNM classiﬁcations constitute the basis of\nthe prognostic classiﬁcation [II, B]\n\u0001 i.v. contrast-enhanced cross-sectional conventional imag-\ning including liver late arterial phase and PET-CT with\n68Ga-labelled SSAs constitute the basis of TNM evalua-\ntion [II, B]\n\u0001 Speciﬁc prognostic factors including tumour growth rate\nor presence of functioning syndromes are taken into ac-\ncount in advanced-stage LCs and ThCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Prolonged survival of most patients with LCs makes\nadjusted toxicity proﬁle of therapeutic interventions crit-\nical [V, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE,\nLOCAL RECURRENCE AND ADJUVANT THERAPY\nLocal/locoregional disease treatment\nControl of a functioning syndrome must be considered\nbefore any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]. Surgery\nrepresents the treatment of choice for LCs (both TCs and\nACs), even in the case of N2 lymph nodal metastases [IV,\nA].54 The surgical approach depends on tumour size, loca-\ntion and preoperative biopsy specimen assessment. The\nchoice of open surgery or minimally invasive approaches\nwill depend on the experience of the surgeon. Patients with\nsmall peripheral nodules may be candidates for minimally\ninvasive access including lung resection and lymph node\ndissection (usually a video-assisted lobectomy/segmentec-\ntomy). The surgical access for centrally located tumours,\nthose with suspected/proven metastatic lymph nodes,\nusually requires thoracotomy, depending on the surgeon’s\nexpertise.\nAnatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy,\nlobectomy,\nbilobectomy,\npneumonectomy)\nand\nlymph\nnode resection (with a minimum of six nodal stations:\nthree hilar and three mediastinaldalso including subcarinal\nstationdas recommended by the European Society of\nThoracic Surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer) is the\npreferred extent of resection [IV, B]. Indeed, wedge resec-\ntion may increase the risk of tumour recurrences, especially\nin N-positive TC or intermediate-grade ACs.4,5,55,56 In ACs,\nE.

Frozen sections of bronchial and\nvascular margins are recommended to rule out tumour\ninvolvement of resection margins, a condition that conse-\nquently imposes a greater pulmonary resection. Systematic\nlymph node dissection is recommended as lymph node\nmetastases may be observed in up to 27% of TCs and in up\nto 47% of ACs, and lymph node resection inﬂuences the\nprognosis and the modality of follow-up5,45,48,49,56 [IV, B].\nR0 resection is achieved in >85% of cases.7,10\nIn case of distal lung parenchyma destruction, there is an\noption for endobronchial resection to relieve the obstruc-\ntion, followed by reassessment and deﬁnitive surgery a few\nweeks later.\nWatchful radiological follow-up, as an alternative to\nsurgery, may be considered in case of cT1N0 carcinoid\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH, but also in MEN-1 patients\nand patients with comorbid conditions, due to the indo-\nlent course of most tumours [IV, C]. Rarely, carcinoids\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH may progress and be\nconsidered\nfor\nsublobar\nresection\n(including\nwedge\nresection), especially in case of large tumour size and/or\npresence of lymph nodes and/or uncontrolled functioning\nsyndrome, as a potential alternative to anatomical surgery\nin these patients to preserve lung function; medical op-\ntions (SSAs) or nonsurgical locoregional therapeutic pro-\ncedures may also constitute potential alternatives to be\ndiscussed case by case [V, C].14,17,24 Patients with non-\nDIPNECH or non-MEN-1 multifocal LC primaries may\nconstitute a distinct entity which may beneﬁt from a\nsimilar management [V, C].59\nUpfront surgery can be offered for all ThCs deemed\nradically resectable [IV, B]. Resectability judgement is\nmostly based on the surgeon’s expertise in thymic surgery.\nProspective registration of these cases is recommended.\nMedian sternotomy is the standard surgical approach and\nless invasive forms of access (video-assisted, robotic-\nassisted) are currently being investigated; in selected\ncases (tumours invasive to the lung, great vessels or with\npleural/pericardial implants), a combined approach (ster-\nnotomy plus anterior thoracotomy) or a thoracotomy are\nrequired to achieve a complete tumour resection. Palliative\nsurgery is not recommended. Lymphadenectomy has his-\ntorically rarely been carried out at the time of resection of\nthymic tumours; however, the latest UICC TNM staging\nsystem recommends that locoregional lymph nodal dissec-\ntion should be carried out also during ThC resection.60 Due\nto the poor prognosis of ThC, prophylactic thymectomy\ncould be discussed in young male adult patients with MEN-\n1 at the time of initial or recurrent parathyroidectomy,\nespecially in families with aggressive thymic tumours [V,\nC];14,15,61\nthe\nbest\nsurgical\napproach\nmay\ninclude\ncervicotomy and upper sternal split or other surgical pro-\ncedures to avoid incomplete thymic resection.\nLocal recurrence therapy\nAfter a median follow-up of 54-121 months, recurrences\noccur in up to 7% of TCs and up to 35% of ACs.4,7,18,53,54\nOne-third are local recurrences.\nIn case of local recurrence, surgical resection with radical\nintent is recommended when technically feasible. In patients\nwith signiﬁcant comorbidity or high operative risk, palliative\nlocoregional procedures or watchful follow-up may constitute\nan alternative (Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).54,62\nAdjuvant therapy\nLarge retrospective studies have reported no beneﬁt of\nadjuvant therapy in both TCs and ACs.5,8-10,18 Therefore, the\nauthors do not recommend routine adjuvant therapy in LCs,\n[IV, D] for TC; [IV, C] for AC (Figure 1). However, it may be\nconsidered in selected ﬁt patients with particularly high risk\nof relapse (i.e. AC N2) after multidisciplinary discussion [IV,\nC]. We recommend prospective registration of these cases.\nMedical options, mainly cytotoxic chemotherapy (ChT) [plus\nor minus radiotherapy (RT)], cited in these guidelines,\nshould be considered ﬁrst.\nAvailable literature suggests no beneﬁt from adjuvant\ntherapy in ThCs [V, C].11-13,32 The majority of the author\npanel suggests individually discussing postoperative thera-\npies, including RT and/or systemic therapies (with options\ndiscussed in these guidelines), with patients with advanced-\nstage R0 or R1-2 resection [V, C] (Figure 2).\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Control of a functioning syndrome must be considered\nbefore any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]\n\u0001 An anatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy,\nlobectomy, bilobectomy) or bronchoplastic procedures\n(e.g. sleeve resections) together with lymph node dissec-\ntion are recommended in localised LCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Patients with cT1N0 LC within the setting of DIPNECH or\nMEN-1 syndromes, or with comorbid conditions, may\nbeneﬁt from an initial radiological follow-up without\ntreatment to determine the growth rate.

The\nbest strategy including sequencing is unknown due to the\nlow number of dedicated trials and absence of predictors of\nresponse in NETs. Such information should be shared with\nthe patient. Prognosis, but not predictive factors, guides the\ndecision-making\ntherapeutic\nmanagement\nin\nnon-\nfunctioning patients [V, A].

The most\nfrequent functioning syndrome is CS in LC, which requires\nannual echocardiography screening for carcinoid heart dis-\nease, when present or in case of increased 5-HIAA levels [V,\nC].60 In addition, prospective studies are expected to deter-\nmine the added value of N-terminal pro hormone B-type\nnatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the detection of carcinoid\nheart disease. In contrast, CS is rare in ThC. Based on\napproval and recommendations in gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NET patients with CS, we recommend long-acting SSAs\nas ﬁrst-line symptomatic treatment of CS [V, B].61,63-65 SSAs\nare also an option in DIPNECH patients presenting with res-\npiratory symptoms.65 Among second-line options described\nin Figure 3 and Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003,64-71\nonly\ntelotristat\nethyl has been approved by the European Medicines Agency\n(EMA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) for the treatment of the diarrhoea of refractory CS.

Palliative surgery\nor radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation or endo-\nbronchial treatment (EBT) of the primary tumour are oc-\ncasionally considered in cases of advanced disease at risk of\nlocal events or refractory CS [V, B]. More frequently, liver,\nbone and lung metastases represent potential targets for\nsuch strategies with the triple objectives of reducing the\nlocoregional risks, the primary tumour and the secretory\nburden (Figures 3 and 4). Such multiple locoregional man-\nagement may represent the only anti-tumour strategy in\npatients with slowly progressive tumours (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) [V, B].67,68,73-75\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Palliative surgery or locoregional procedures (RFA, cryoa-\nblation, EBT) of the primary tumour are occasionally\nconsidered in cases of advanced disease at risk of local\nevents or refractory CS [V, B]\n\u0001 Multiple locoregional therapies including surgery, com-\nbined or not with SSAs, are recommended to decrease\nthe tumour burden, to control hormonal secretions\nand to prevent local complications, as a ﬁrst-line thera-\npeutic approach in patients with advanced slowly pro-\ngressing LC [V, B].\nSystemic anti-tumour therapy\nSystemic anti-tumour therapies of patients with advanced\nLC are various, including SSAs, ChT, everolimus, peptide\nreceptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and interferon-a (IFN-\na) (Figure 4). These systemic therapies should be discussed\nwithin expert multidisciplinary teams for patients with\nmorphologically progressive tumours, high tumour burden\nor refractory functioning syndromes. No speciﬁc phase III\ntrial for LC exclusively has been published so far, therefore\nevidence comes mostly from retrospective analyses, less\nfrom phase II, single-arm trials, and sporadically from\nrandomised phase II or subgroups of phase III trials that\nenrolled a majority of GEP-NET patients. Everolimus is the\nonly treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA for LC.\nBased on the very limited data available in advanced ThC,\nwe recommend applying the same strategy as for LC.\nSSAs\nOctreotide [long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg] and lanreotide\n(120 mg) are the two SSAs most commonly used in clinical\npractice. Both showed antiproliferative activity and gains in\ntime to progression or progression-free survival (PFS) in\nplacebo-controlled, phase III trials enrolling good prognostic\nor\nslowly\nprogressive\nGEP-NETs,64\nwhere\nthey\nwere\napproved by the FDA and EMA for antiproliferative pur-\nposes. The placebo-controlled, randomised phase III trial,\nwhich evaluated lanreotide 120 mg in advanced LC, was\nstopped\nfor\ninsufﬁcient\nenrolment\n(SPINET\ntrial\nNCT02683941). Therefore, the feasibility of phase III trials in\nLC remains an issue. Two dedicated retrospective case series\nreported potential positive impact of SSAs, with a PFS of 17\nand 11 months, respectively.76,77 In the single, published,\nrandomised phase II LUNA trial, pasireotide 60 mg every 4\nweeks, in ﬁrst or second line after standard SSA therapy,\nachieved a 39% progression-free rate (PFR) at 9 months, in\na series of 41 LCs or ThCs with Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumours (RECIST) progression before enrolment\n(LUNA study). The PFR was not signiﬁcantly different from\nthat achieved with everolimus alone.20 On this basis, the\nauthors recommend SSA, for its better tolerability, as ﬁrst-\nline therapy in TC or slowly progressing somatostatin re-\nceptor (SSTR)-positive LC [IV, C].\nTargeted therapies\nEverolimus has been investigated in several clinical trials\nwhich included metastatic LCs and is currently the most\nstudied agent in LC. The RADIANT-4 study represents the\nlargest series of LCs ever included in a phase III trial\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10\n.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).78,79 Based on these results,\nthe FDA and EMA approved everolimus in advanced, pro-\ngressing, non-functional pulmonary and digestive NETs in\n2016. Furthermore, in the RADIANT-4 trial, everolimus\ndelayed\ntumour\nprogression\nwhile\npreserving\noverall\nhealth-related QoL.80 Everolimus has been reported to be\npotentially effective also in a post hoc analysis of the\nRADIANT-2 trial regarding a subgroup of LC associated with\na history of CS (Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).71,81\nEver-\nolimus is considered as ﬁrst-line therapy in the majority of\nACs or following progression to SSA for both TC and AC\npatients [II, B] (see Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003 for detailed\nLUNA trial data).\nE.

Patients\nwith disseminated disease may beneﬁt from afﬁliation to\nspecialised palliative care units concerning pain treatment,\npsychosocial impact and rehabilitation [II, B].\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Follow-up for LC should be life-long, since recurrences\nremain very common over time [IV, C]\n\u0001 After radical resection of LC, life-long follow-up with low-\nradiation imaging procedures and increasing interval of\ntime, adjusted to prognostic factors, is recommended\n[V, C]\n\u0001 Follow-up of LC and ThC patients focuses on tumour and\nfunctioning syndrome evaluations as well as evaluations\nof long-term toxicity and speciﬁc conditions including\nDIPNECH or MEN-1 [V, B]\n\u0001 In patients with advanced tumours, morphological\nfollow-up is recommended every 2-12 months depend-\ning on WHO histology, tumour growth rate and control\nof functioning syndrome [V, C]\n\u0001 Follow-up of ThC is recommended in all patients in a\nsimilar manner to ACs [V, B]\n\u0001 Patients with disseminated disease may beneﬁt from afﬁl-\niation to specialised palliative care units concerning pain\ntreatment, psychosocial impact and rehabilitation [II, B].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis Clinical Practice Guideline was developed in accordance\nwith the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical\nPractice Guidelines development, https://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology.\nThe\nrelevant\nliterature has been selected by the expert authors. An ESMO\nMagnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale (ESMO-MCBS) table with\nESMO-MCBS scores is included in Supplementary Table S7,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003.\nESMO-MCBS v1.1104 was used to calculate scores for new\ntherapies/indications approved by the EMA since 1 January\n2016 (https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-MCBS). The\nscores have been calculated by the ESMO-MCBS Working\nGroup and validated by the ESMO Guidelines Committee.\nLevels of evidence and grades of recommendation have been\napplied using the system shown in Supplementary Table S8,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003.105\nStatements without grading were considered justiﬁed stan-\ndard clinical practice by the authors.\nFUNDING\nNo external funding has been received for the preparation\nof these guidelines.

It affects predominantly older,\nfair-skinned Caucasians and exhibits aggressive behaviour\nwith a high recurrence rate and a propensity for early\nmetastasis.1 Despite new advances in therapies for MCC,\nthe prognosis remains poor. With the incidence of MCC\nincreasing rapidly across Europe, prompt diagnosis and\neffective and harmonised management are imperative for\nimproving patient care.2\nThe European Parliament and the European Commission\nrecommend treating patients with rare cancers in centres\nlinked to the European Reference Network for Rare Adult\nSolid Cancers (EURACAN). In these referral centres with a\nhigh volume of MCC patients, the clinical experience of a\nmultidisciplinary team (MDT) specialising in skin cancers\nguarantees better treatment outcomes and access to\nclinical trials. Therefore, the objective of this guideline is to\nprovide a comprehensive reference for MCC, which is based\non a critical evaluation of current evidence and opinion of\nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) experts in\npartnership with EURACAN.\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nThe global incidence rates of MCC are difﬁcult to calculate\nbecause of its rarity, geographic and demographic vari-\nability and lack of large epidemiological studies.3 Since its\nﬁrst description in 1972, MCC incidence rates have\nsteadily increased, likely due to both the reﬁnements in\ndiagnostic capabilities and the progressively ageing pop-\nulation.4,5 The Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe\n(RARECARE) database reported the crude incidence esti-\nmate as 0.13 per 100 000 in 1995-2002.6 The incidence\nrate reported over time in the recent analysis of the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data-\nbase showed that in 1986, incidence and mortality rates\nper 100 000 were 0.22 and 0.03, respectively; these rates\nincreased to 0.79 and 0.43, respectively, in 2011.7 The\nhighest incidence rates of MCC are in Australia, where the\nage-adjusted incidence rate reported in Queensland was\n1.6 per 100 000.8\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: February 2024.\n2059-7029/© 2024 The Author(s).

In Australia, this\nis the opposite, with 80% UV- and 20% MCPyV-related.3\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nClinical diagnosis\nThe clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional lymph nodes (LNs),\ncomorbid conditions and patient life expectancy. MCC\nclassically presents as a pink or red-violaceous, painless,\nﬁrm, rapidly growing, dome-shaped or red plaque skin\nlesion, ranging in size from 1 to 2 cm. It typically occurs in\nolder patients in sun-exposed areas of their bodies. The\npredominant sites of MCC localisation include the head and\nneck (45%), upper limbs (24%), lower limbs (10%) and trunk\nor other sites (<10%), while in 11% of cases, there is no\nidentiﬁable primary lesion. Ulceration may occur in more\nadvanced MCC lesions. MCC enlarges rapidly, metastasises\nin transit to the skin and/or to ﬁrst-echelon LNs (26% of\ncases at initial presentation) and then to higher-order nodal\nregions and distant sites such as bones, liver and brain (8%\nof cases at initial presentation).12 MCC may be mis-\ndiagnosed as squamous- or basal-cell carcinoma, amela-\nnotic melanoma, adnexal tumour, primary cutaneous B-cell\nlymphoma or skin disorders such as pyogenic granuloma\nand\ninﬂammatory\ndisorders.13\nSince\nMCC\nhas\nbeen\nobserved contiguous to, or intermingled with, other skin\ncancers, the detection of polymorphous vessels and/or\nmilky-red areas by dermatoscopy enhances the differential\ndiagnostic accuracy, especially for patients with multiple\nskin lesions.14\nAetiology and molecular biology\nDespite major advances in understanding MCC carcino-\ngenesis, the cellular origin of MCC is still unclear. MCC has\nbeen hypothesised to originate from dermal ﬁbroblasts,\npre-/pro-B cells, Merkel-cell precursors potentially derived\nfrom epidermal stem cells and hair follicle stem cells.15 MCC\ncarcinogenesis can be initiated in the cell of origin either by\nUV-mediated DNA damage caused by chronic exposure to\nsunlight or by integration of the MCPyV into the host\ngenome.16,17 MCPyV is a ubiquitous virus usually acquired\nduring childhood, as indicated by frequent seropositivity of\nantibodies against the capsid protein VP1 in the blood.18\nHowever, primary infection with MCPyV does not cause\nany discernible signs or symptoms. Despite the high prev-\nalence of MCPyV infection, very few people develop MCC.\nAn essential feature of MCPyV-associated MCC is that the\ntumour cells express speciﬁc products of the viral early\ngenes, i.e. small T antigen (ST) and a truncated version of\nlarge T antigen (LT). LT and ST have also been referred to as\nviral oncoproteins, and their capacity to interact with mul-\ntiple cellular proteins, thereby altering their function, has\nbeen demonstrated.19,20 While MCPyV-associated MCCs are\ncharacterised by very low frequencies of somatic mutations,\nvirus-negative MCCs are among the tumours with the\nhighest mutational load, typically displaying UV signa-\ntures.21 Among the aberrations found in MCPyV-negative\nMCC,\nmutations\ndisrupting\nthe\ngene\nencoding\nthe\nretinoblastoma-associated protein RB1 (the key protein\ncontrolling cell cycle entry) are almost always present.\nAnalogously, RB1 function in virus-associated MCC is\ninhibited by binding the LXCXE motif of LT to RB1; in either\ncase, cells are unable to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell\ncycle.21 Interestingly, MCPyV is not found in cases of MCC\nassociated with cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, indi-\ncating that it does not play a part in these combined\ntumours.22,23\nHistopathology\nHistopathological features of MCC are those of a small-blue-\nround-cell tumour with a vesicular nucleus and scant\ncytoplasm.24 However, several different histopathological\npatterns exist, including trabecular, intermediate and small-\ncell variants. Neoplastic cells can also be large and may\npresent with a pleomorphic morphology. The nucleoli are\nmultiple and usually not prominent. Mitotic and apoptotic\nrates are frequently high. The tumour regularly inﬁltrates\nthe reticular dermis and subcutis. The epidermis, papillary\ndermis and adnexal structures are usually spared, although\nepidermotropism is observed in up to 10% of cases. The\npresence of intra-lymphatic emboli and isolated tumour\ncells close to the surgical margins may explain the high rate\nof local recurrences.24,25 As the histomorphology of MCC on\nhaematoxylineeosin (H&E) sections is rather nonspeciﬁc,\nthe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires immunohisto-\nchemical staining to rule out other tumours that display a\nsmall-blue-round-cell morphology (e.g. basal-cell carci-\nnoma; metastatic small-cell carcinoma, particularly from the\nlung; cutaneous lymphoma; anaplastic sweat gland carci-\nnoma; melanoma; Ewing’s sarcoma; neuroblastoma and\nrhabdomyosarcoma).24\nMCC cells express several types of cytoskeletal keratins\n(CKs), particularly CK20 (membranous and/or paranuclear\ndot-like), CK8, CK18 and CK19. A small subset of MCCs\n(<10%) are negative for CK20; these cases are characterised\nby a high mutational burden and are generally not associ-\nated with MCPyV. In addition to CKs, neoplastic cells also\nexpress chromogranin A, synaptophysin, cluster of differ-\nentiation\n(CD)56,\nneuron-speciﬁc\nenolase\n(NSE)\nand\nhuntingtin-interacting protein 1. MCC is usually negative for\nthyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), leukocyte common\nantigen, melan A, mammalian achaete-scute homologue 1,\nvimentin, protein S100 and CK7.23,24,26 However, rare cases\nESMO Open\nI. Lugowska et al.\n2\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\n\n---\nof MCC can be positive for TTF1 or CK7, and so interpre-\ntation of the staining patterns of these two antigens should\nbe carried out with caution. These markers should be\nincluded in an immunopanel for MCC conﬁrmation and\nexclusion of other diagnostic considerations.\nNo histological marker has been reliably associated with\nthe selective identiﬁcation of either virus- or UV-associated\nMCC: while positive staining for MCPyV LT strongly suggests\nan MCPyV-associated MCC, negative staining does not\nnecessarily rule it out.27,28 Although all of these markers are\nhelpful and essential for diagnosis, particularly in the\npresence of artefacts, no convincing evidence supports their\nuse to predict prognosis or response to therapy. Concerning\nthe latter, variable numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating cytotoxic\nT lymphocytes (not identiﬁed, brisk, non-brisk) are found in\nMCC tumours, and their presence is associated with a\nbetter prognosis, which is particularly favourable if their T-\ncell receptor repertoire is characterised by clonal diversity.29\nThe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires histopatholog-\nical examination of tissue obtained by incisional/excisional\nbiopsy.4 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other tissues such\nas fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical margins;\ntumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratumoural\nlymphocyte\ninﬁltration;\nimmunohistochemical\nproﬁle;\nMCPyV status and mitotic rate.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional LNs, comorbid\nconditions and patient life expectancy [III, A].\n\u0003 Histopathological MCC conﬁrmation should include H&E\nwith the dedicated immunopanel [III, A].\n\u0003 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other structures\nsuch as fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical mar-\ngins; tumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratu-\nmoural lymphocyte inﬁltration; immunohistochemical\nproﬁle; MCPyV status and mitotic rate [III, A].\n\u0003 Dermatoscopymayenhancedifferentialdiagnosticaccuracy,\nespecially for patients with multiple skin lesions [IV, B].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nThe preferred classiﬁcation is the eighth version of the\nUnion\nfor\nInternational\nCancer\nControl\n(UICC)\nTNM\n(tumourenodeemetastasis) staging and classiﬁcation sys-\ntem, which provides information for both management and\nprognosis of patients with MCC (see Supplementary\nTables\nS1-S4,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nesmoop.2024.102977).30 This classiﬁcation was developed\nbased on data collected from 9387 patients with MCC in the\nNational Cancer Database. Staging and risk assessment\nprocedures are determined based on disease presentation\nat diagnosis.31\nThe initial evaluation in MCC should include a complete\nexamination of the skin with particular attention to any\nsuspicious cancerous skin lesions, tumour satellites, in-\ntransit metastases, regional LNs and systemic metastases.\nThe assessment of disease extension in all patients is\nmandatory: ultrasound of regional LNs for patients with\nclinical stage I-II disease and computed tomography (CT) of\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis (and head/neck for head/\nneck primaries).32 Positron emission tomography (PET)eCT\nappears more sensitive than CT alone based on published\nmeta-analyses and other retrospective studies; it was\nshown that 16.8% of patients who underwent PETeCT had\ntheir disease upstaged compared with 6.9% of those who\nunderwent CT scans only.33,34 Therefore, if PET and/or PETe\nCT with [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) are available,\nthey are the preferred cross-sectional imaging methods to\nassess local and distant disease.16 If additional clinical\nsymptoms are present, detailed imaging studies using\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be carried out.\nSentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) with an appropriate immuno-\npanel is considered the most reliable staging procedure for\nidentifying subclinical nodal involvement. As such, it is\nrecommended for all patients with clinically node-negative\ndisease who are ﬁt for radical therapy. SLNB should be\ncarried out alongside local surgical therapy of the primary\ntumour with special attention to drainage patterns. The\nobserved 17.1% false-negative SLNB results may occur in\nimmunocompromised patients or tumours localised in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region.35,36 SLNB enables the\ndetection of micrometastases in approximately one-third of\npatients with clinically node-negative MCC, and its positivity\nrate is w20% for T1 and 40%-50% for T2 MCCs.37-39 In\nchallenging locations for SLNB, single-photon emission\ncomputed tomographyeCT techniques should be utilised.40\nAccess to a full pathological report with the number of\ninvolved LNs, the size of metastatic deposits and the status\nof the extracapsular extension is crucial for staging, pre-\ndiction and decision making.41 Patients with clinically\napparent nodal disease at presentation with an unknown\nprimary should have a biopsy for histological conﬁrmation\nof MCC.12,42\nThe 5-year overall survival (OS) in all MCC patients is be-\ntween 48% and 63%: 64% in patients without metastases\n(stage I-II), 51% in those with regional LN involvement (stage\nIII), 68% in those with an unknown primary tumour and 17%-\n29% in patients with distant metastases (stage IV).39,43-45\nRetrospective data have shown that unfavourable clinical\nprognostic factors are the presence of regional and distant\nmetastases, primary tumour diameter >2 cm and/or its\nextension beyond the dermis, location in the head/neck\nregion, >75 years of age, male sex and presence of co-\nmorbidity, especially immunosuppression (e.g. HIV, chronic\nlymphocytic leukaemia).3,39,43,46 The poor prognosis has\nalso been linked to histopathological futures such as posi-\ntive margins after resection, a high mitotic rate, inﬁltrative\n(rather than circumscribed) growth pattern, lymphovascular\ninﬁltration and p63 expression, whereas LT and RB1 protein\nexpression and intratumoural CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltra-\ntion correlate with a more favourable prognosis.10,12,24\nHowever, there are no prospective data available in MCC.\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n3\n\n---\nProgrammed\ndeath-ligand\n1\n(PD-L1)\nexpression\nis\nfrequently detected in MCC tumour cells and the tumour\nmicroenvironment. Nevertheless, its expression does not\ncorrelate with prognosis.47-49 Serum markers such as anti-\nbodies against MCPyV or NSE require further prospective\nvalidation.50,51\nRecommendations\n\u0003 SLNB is indicated to improve prognostic staging, e.g. to\nrule out occult nodal disease, but the precision of\nSLNB is less reliable in immunocompromised patients\nand in patients whose tumours are located in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region and with aberrant\nLN drainage [III, A].\n\u0003 Mandatory imaging studies comprise CT scans of the\nchest, abdomen, pelvis and head/neck (for head/neck\nprimaries). If available, whole-body FDGePET/CT is pref-\nerable over contrast-enhanced CT scan; MRI imaging of\nspeciﬁc organs should be carried out if clinically indi-\ncated [III, A].\n\u0003 The value of immunohistological markers, such as p63,\nPD-L1, NSE or CD200, is not fully established [IV, B].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nThe mainstay of treatment for patients with localised MCC\nis wide local excision (WLE) followed by tumour bed\nradiotherapy (RT) and management of the nodal basin. A\nproposed algorithm for the management of locoregional\nMCC is shown in Figure 1.\nSince wide excision can potentially compromise lymphatic\ndrainage, an SLNB should be carried out simultaneously with\nsurgical treatment of the primary MCC. A precise surgical\ntechnique called Mohs surgery may be considered instead of\nWLE in selected cases based on results from meta-analyses of\npatients with stage I MCC, which showed similar recurrence\nrates for both surgical modalities: local recurrence rates were\n6.8% for WLE versus 8.5% for Mohs surgery, and regional\nrecurrence rates were similar at w15%, although no rando-\nmised trials comparing traditional WLE with Mohs surgery\nwere included in these meta-analyses.52\nAfter resection, there is a need to obtain a clear patho-\nlogical margin, although the size of surgical margin is under\ndebate.53 In one publication, a margin >2 cm was associ-\nated with a signiﬁcant improvement in OS54; however, other\ndata have not supported a correlation between margin size\nbeyond 1 cm and additional clinical beneﬁt. In a study of\n6156 patients with localised MCC, resection margins >1 cm\nwere associated with improvements in OS compared with\nmargins of <1 cm; 5-year survival rates were 90% and 77%\n(P < 0.001), respectively.55\nAccording\nto\nﬁndings\nfrom\na\nretrospective\nstudy\ncomprising a cohort of patients who had clear margins\nfollowing resection and received post-operative RT, surgical\nexcision with margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus >1.0 cm was not\nassociated with any signiﬁcant difference in terms of OS,\nany recurrence-free survival (RFS) or local RFS.56 Thus,\nsurgical margins might be reduced to avoid reconstruction,\nespecially for preserving cosmetics (face) or function (lo-\ncations close to joints). Findings from this retrospective\nstudy also showed that excision, even with narrow margins\n(0.5-1.0 cm), was not associated with outcome. Cancer-\nspeciﬁc survival was 76.8% versus 76.2% for patients with\nresection margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus 1-2 cm, respectively.\nHowever, for patients with narrow resection margins, post-\noperative RT to the tumour bed is mandatory.56 In sum-\nmary, there is a need to obtain surgical margins of 1-2 cm\nand histologically negative margins, if feasible, which must\nbe followed by adjuvant RT regardless of the type of sur-\ngery.15,57-59\nThe beneﬁt of adjuvant RT following excision of the pri-\nmary tumour was shown in a systematic review and meta-\nanalysis considering >17 000 patients with stages I-III MCC\nfrom 29 observational studies.60 A favourable OS beneﬁt\nwas associated with surgery plus adjuvant RT versus surgery\nalone [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)\n0.75-0.86, P < 0.001]. The study also reported a signiﬁcant\nbeneﬁt in locoregional and local disease-free survival (DFS),\nbut not distant DFS (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.22-0.42; HR 0.21, 95%\nCI 0.14-0.33 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49-1.14, respectively).60\nThe largest series to date to assess whether adjuvant\ntherapy was associated with better survival included 6908\ncases from the National Cancer Database.61 It showed that\nfor localised MCC, surgery and adjuvant RT was associated\nwith a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in OS compared\nwith surgery alone (stage I: HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80; stage\nII: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89), but in patients with regional\nnodal metastases (stage III), neither the addition of adju-\nvant RT nor chemotherapy (ChT) had a signiﬁcant impact on\nOS. These ﬁndings suggest that the addition of RT may\nbeneﬁt the local control of localised disease; however, it is\nreasonable to believe that survival in patients with more\nadvanced disease may be driven by the presence of sub-\nclinical distant metastasis.61\nIt is worth noting that the MCC patient population con-\ntains elderly patients, which frequently causes clinicians to\ndeviate from standard treatment protocols. This was\nrecently\nillustrated\nin\na\nstudy\nthat\ninvestigated\nthe\nconcordance to adjuvant treatment guidelines in patients\nwith stage I-II MCC.62 Of the 2330 patients in this study,\n1858 had an indication for adjuvant RT [according to Na-\ntional Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines\ncriteria63] but only 57% of these patients received RT; those\nwho received RT had a 5-year OS advantage over those who\ndid not (76% versus 68%, P < 0.0003). Conversely, of the\n472 patients without an indication for adjuvant RT (ac-\ncording to NCCN criteria), 43% received RT; this group did\nnot show an OS beneﬁt over those who did not receive RT\n(79% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.48).62\nThe optimal adjuvant RT dose is unclear.64 In a retro-\nspective study of 2093 patients who underwent surgery\nfollowed by adjuvant RT, four groups of patients receiving\ndifferent doses of RT (30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy, 50-55 Gy and 55-\n70 Gy) were analysed; the 3-year OS rates were 41.8%,\n69.0%, 69.2% and 66.0%, respectively.65 An Australian study\nESMO Open\nI. Lugowska et al.\n4\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\n\n---\ndocumenting a dose response showed that no patients with\nmacroscopic MCC developed in-ﬁeld relapses at doses\n>56 Gy.66 Furthermore, in a large population-based study\nof patients with head and neck-located MCC (N ¼ 1625)\nundergoing adjuvant RT (85% with negative margins and\n15% with residual MCC), a dose range of 50-55 Gy conferred\na survival advantage compared with doses <50 Gy. There\nwas no signiﬁcant improvement by escalating doses beyond\nthis range, which could reﬂect toxicity-related morbidity or\ndeath from competing risks in this mostly older patient\ncohort.65 Therefore, a radiation dose of 50-60 Gy is often\nrecommended in MCC, achieving in-ﬁeld control.\nIn some patients, surgical therapy is not feasible due to\nthe extent of disease (technically inoperable) or the pres-\nence of signiﬁcant (co)morbidity. Since MCC is radiosensi-\ntive, RT as a single modality is an alternative to surgery in\nthis group. The natural history of patients treated with\ndeﬁnitive RT is out-of-ﬁeld relapse with in-ﬁeld control\nachieved in most patients.38 In a systematic review, an\nalmost 90% in-ﬁeld control rate was documented following\ndeﬁnitive RT with a mean dose delivered of just under\n50 Gy.38 Recurrences occurred at 39/332 sites (13 local\nrelapses, 26 regional) for a cumulative post-RT in-ﬁeld\nrecurrence rate of 11.7%. Of note, there was no association\nbetween RT dose and incidence of recurrence or non-\nrecurrence. RT of the primary tumour can also be curative\nwhen excision is not possible due to severe comorbidity\ndisqualifying the patient from surgery or in individuals who\nrefuse surgical treatment.67 However, there is also a lack\nof consensus regarding the optimal dose/fractionation\nschedule. Independently, the European Consensus-based\ninterdisciplinary guideline and NCCN guidelines propose\ndoses of 60-66 Gy for deﬁnitive treatment of patients with\ngrossly positive primary tumour resection margins and/or\nclinically evident lymphadenopathy.15,63\nManagement of early-stage MCC (stage I-II)\nIn the early stages of MCC (stage I-II), the standard treat-\nment approach is WLE of the primary tumour.15,68 In T1-4\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage I-III)\nPrimary tumour management\nLN management\nSLN\npositive\nSLN\nnegative\nClinically negative LNs\nClinically positive LNs and in CUP\nNodal dissection and/or RT [III, B]\nAdjuvant RT ± nodal\ndissection [III, B]\nClinical trials with\n(neo)adjuvant systemic\ntherapy [III,A]\nClinical trials with (neo)adjuvant\nsystemic therapy [III,A]\nSLNB with immunopanel [III,A]\nOperable:\nWLE ± RT [IV, B]\nObservation\nDeﬁnitive RT [III, B]\nInoperable:\ndeﬁnitive RT [V, B]\nor\nanti-PD-1 therapya [III,A]\nRT (high risk of false-negative\nSLNB)b [IV, B]\nFigure 1.

In a review of\n29 studies that included patients with stage I-II MCC, no\nsigniﬁcant difference in regional recurrence rate was\ndemonstrated with versus without adjuvant RT (14.3%\nversus 4.6%, P ¼ 0.31).38 Furthermore, similar regional\nnodal recurrence and OS rates were reported in a cohort\nof 240 patients who underwent SLNB or elective LN\ndissection\nwithout\nprior\npathological\nnodal\nstaging\n(P ¼ 0.056).69 However, in selected clinical situations,\nthere is value in adjuvant regional RT. It is recommended\nin patients with profound immunosuppression, if SLNB is\nnot carried out or its accuracy is questionable [i.e.\nanatomic compromise, aberrant LN drainage or the pres-\nence of multiple sentinel LN (SLN) basins which is typical\nin head, neck or midline trunk MCC].70\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III)\nPatients with stage III MCC have a competing risk of sys-\ntemic recurrence. On the other hand, in elderly patients,\nsevere comorbidity may lead to increased risk for intra-/\npost-operative complications and higher morbidity related\nto local therapy. Each decision on adjuvant therapy should\nideally be made within the conﬁnes of an MDT. In this sit-\nuation, there is a recommendation to include patients in\nclinical trials for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy when\navailable.\nIn the presence of microscopic metastasis detected on\nSLNB or during node dissection [pathological stage IIIA: T1-\n4, N1a, N1a(sn), M0], adjuvant RT alone or in combination\nwith complete LN dissection (CLND) may be considered and\nrequires an individualised approach. In a prospective study,\n163 patients with SLN metastasis only underwent CLND or\nRT, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in survival\noutcomes (5-year OS: 71% versus 64%, P ¼ 1.0; DFS: 52%\nversus 61%, P ¼ 0.8; nodal RFS: 76% versus 91%, P ¼ 0.3 or\ndistant relapse-free survival: 65% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.3,\nrespectively). With sufﬁcient in-ﬁeld control of macroscopic\nMCC, in selected fragile patients who cannot tolerate nodal\nexcision under local anaesthesia, RT as monotherapy should\nbe considered.71 Another retrospective study of 447 pa-\ntients with MCC and a positive SLNB collected in the Na-\ntional Cancer Database showed that adjuvant RT \u0004 CLND\nled to a survival beneﬁt compared with CLND alone or\nobservation.72 Therefore, in younger patients (<75 years of\nage) with fewer comorbidities, a multidisciplinary approach\nwith adjuvant RT and CLND may be beneﬁcial. However, the\npotential beneﬁt may be decreased by the potential com-\nplications of CLND, such as lymphoedema, post-operative\nwound infection, skin necrosis and wound dehiscence,\nwhich is higher in the inguinal basin than in axillary\ndissection (26% versus 9%, respectively).73\nNo randomised trials have evaluated the efﬁcacy of\nadjuvant ChT or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with\nMCC. Therefore, adjuvant ChT is not routinely indicated. The\ndata supporting CRT are derived from a retrospective study\nof 4815 patients with head and neck MCC.74 In male pa-\ntients with positive margins and a tumour size of >3 cm,\npost-operative CRT and RT both provided a survival beneﬁt\ncompared with surgery alone (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81;\nHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92, respectively).74 In a study of\n6908 patients in the National Cancer Database, there was\nno beneﬁt (or detriment) of giving adjuvant ChT to patients\nwith high-risk disease.61 In this fragile population, the risk of\nserious side-effects is signiﬁcantly higher due to existing\ncomorbidities, and ChT-related mortality is between 4% and\n8%. There is also a concern about the immunosuppressive\neffects of ChT, which may lead to the development and\nprogression of MCC.75-77\nA limited number of published case reports and series\nhave addressed MCC of unknown primary (pathological\nstage IIIA: T0, N1b, M0). This group has a better outcome\nthan patients with known primary and synchronous nodal\nmetastases.12,42 The recommendation in this group is to\ncarry out a biopsy for pathological conﬁrmation of MCC,\nFDGePETeCT to rule out distant metastatic disease and\nmanagement of the nodal lesions similar to that proposed\nfor stage IIIB MCC.\nFor patients with clinically positive nodal disease (path-\nological stage IIIB, T1-4, N1b-3, M0), cross-sectional imaging\nis advised before surgery. There have been no prospective\ntrials evaluating the appropriate extent of CLND clearance\nfor MCC; in the absence of such evidence, it is recom-\nmended to follow the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline\n(CPG) for cutaneous melanoma.78 An analysis of the SEER\ndatabase incorporated propensity scoring and matched-pair\nanalysis and reported no difference in MCC-speciﬁc survival\nin patients who received RT after CLND versus observa-\ntion.79,80 In another study, Lewis et al. carried out a data-\nbase analysis encompassing 1254 patients and found\nreductions in local and regional recurrences with similar\nrates of distant metastases, but no statistical difference in\nterms of OS and MCC-speciﬁc survival.81 Therefore, patients\nwith node-positive MCC should be considered for clinical\ntrials with (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy because neither\nadjuvant RT nor ChT has been associated with a statistically\nsigniﬁcant impact on OS.61\nSatellite or in-transit metastases (pathological stage IIIB,\nT1-4, N2-3, M0) at post-operative histology are caused by\nthe cutaneous or subcutaneous intra-lymphatic spread. The\nfrequency is unclear but it is always associated with poor\nsurvival.42,82,83 In bulky, multiple and/or frequently recur-\nrent locoregional metastases, isolated limb perfusion may\nESMO Open\nI.

In a phase I-II study (CheckMate 358) of\nnivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting, surgical resection\nwas conducted after two doses of nivolumab 240 mg given\n2 weeks apart.85 Among the 36 patients who underwent\nsurgery, 17 had a conﬁrmed pathological CR (pCR) and 18\nhad a partial response (PR) by radiological assessment. At a\nmedian follow-up of 20 months, no patient with a pCR\nexperienced disease relapse. Additional studies are required\nto conﬁrm the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and the\nextent of surgery or post-operative RT in patients with a\npCR.85 In the adjuvant setting, although initial reports failed\nto show a therapeutic beneﬁt with ipilimumab as adjuvant\nmonotherapy, interim results from a prospective rando-\nmised study suggest a beneﬁt in terms of DFS for the pro-\ngrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab.\nHowever, ﬁnal results from prospective randomised trials\nare required to determine the true beneﬁts of adjuvant PD-\n(L)1 blockade.86\nRecommendations\n\u0003 An MDT meeting comprising experts with signiﬁcant\nMCC experience should be convened to diagnose and\nmake decisions about therapy; the preferred option is\nparticipation in clinical trials [III, A].\nManagement of local/locoregional disease (stage I-III)\n\u0003 After excisional biopsy, WLE with a margin of 1-2 cm\nis considered adequate; if a resection margin of\n1-2 cm is not technically achievable, a narrower\nmargin (0.5-1.0 cm) with adjuvant RT may also be\nacceptable [IV, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant RT with 50-60 Gy to the tumour bed is recom-\nmended for tumours of \u00051 cm in diameter and/or with\nnegative prognostic features (stage \u0005IB) [IV, A].\n\u0003 In patients at very low risk of locoregional recurrence\n(stage IA), clinical observation may be an alternative\nbut such a decision should only be made at referral cen-\ntres [V, A].\n\u0003 When WLE is not feasible, deﬁnitive RT of the primary\ntumour is an alternative approach [V, B].\nManagement of early-stage MCC (stage I-II; T1-4 N0 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 SLNB should be carried out during local surgical therapy\nof the primary tumour with special attention to drainage\npatterns [III, A].\n\u0003 In patients with a negative SLNB, observation is an op-\ntion, but in case of a risk of false negativity of SLNB or\nwhen SLNB is not carried out, adjuvant RT to the primary\nsite and nodal basin may be considered. This decision\nmust only be made at referral centres [IV, B].\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III; T1-4 N1-3 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 After a positive SLNB, adjuvant RT alone or in combina-\ntion with CLND is recommended after an MDT discussion\n[IV, B].\n\u0003 In clinically positive LNs, multiple nodal involvements or\nextra-nodal extension of the SLN, regional LN dissection\nwith post-operative RT is recommended (or deﬁnitive RT\nin inoperable patients) [III, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant ChT is not recommended [IV, D]; patients should\nbe considered for clinical trials with (neo)adjuvant sys-\ntemic therapy of modern immunotherapies [III, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE\nDespite the recent advances in diagnosis and treatment,\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC remain incurable. Admin-\nistration of immunotherapy in the ﬁrst-/second-line settings\nis recommended (if there is no contraindication for immu-\nnotherapy).87,88 ChT, palliative RT, best supportive care or\nparticipation in clinical trials should be considered based on\nthe clinical situation. In patients with recurrent oligometa-\nstatic and resectable disease, surgical removal or stereo-\ntactic irradiation of metastases can be considered if\nsystemic immunotherapy is contraindicated or the disease\nis refractory. A proposed algorithm for the management of\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC is shown in Figure 2.\nImmunotherapy\nPD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors are effective in the treatment\nof metastatic MCC.89 These drugs allow the reactivation of T\nlymphocytes and the triggering of the adaptive immune\nsystem by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 of the\ntumour\nmicroenvironment\nand\nPD-1\nexpressed\non\nlymphocyte surfaces. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 restores the\nantitumour activity of effector T cells and the function of\nexhausted T cells.89\nDespite their proven efﬁcacy, resistance to immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can occur due to different\nmechanisms: intrinsic resistance in patients who do not\nrespond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or acquired resistance in\npatients\nwhose\ntumours\nprogress\nafter\nthe\ninitial\nresponse.90-92 Open questions regarding the immunogenic\ncharacteristics\nof\nboth\nMCPyV-positive\nand\n-negative\nMerkel-cell tumours and the lack of predictive biomarkers\nof response to treatment are still under evaluation. Clinical\nbeneﬁt was not associated with any other biomarker eval-\nuated to date, such as PD-L1, MCPyV status, tumour\nmutational burden or CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltration.90-92\nImmunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab [ESMO-\nMagnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale (ESMO-MCBS) v1.1\nscore: 4; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Euro-\npean Medicines Agency (EMA) approved], pembrolizumab\n[ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA approved, not EMA\napproved], retifanlimab (FDA and approved) and nivolu-\nmab (not EMA or FDA approved), have shown high\nresponse rates both as ﬁrst- and second-line treatments,\nI.

Therefore,\nimmunotherapy is recommended in this setting if no\ncontraindications exist.\nThe ideal duration of ICI therapy is currently unknown.\nOne retrospective analysis of data collected at a single\ninstitute showed that among 65 patients treated with\navelumab, 25 had an FDGePETeCT-conﬁrmed CR. The 12-\nmonth RFS rate in these patients was 88% (95% CI 0.74-\n1.0). Reasons for stopping treatment included completion\nof 1 year of treatment (13 patients), toxicity (5 patients) and\npatient preference (7 patients).93 Prospective data from\nlarger patient cohorts and with longer follow-up are\ntherefore required to conﬁrm the ideal duration of ICI\ntherapy in patients with MCC.\nAvelumab. The efﬁcacy and safety of avelumab, an anti-PD-\nL1 inhibitor, were analysed in the JAVELIN Merkel 200 study,\nwhich was divided into parts A and B.94,95 Part A included\n88 patients with metastatic MCC who progressed after at\nleast one line of ChT. After >2 years of follow-up, the\nobjective response rate (ORR) was 33.0% (11.4% CR), me-\ndian duration of response (DoR) was 40.5 months and the\nDoR was >2 years in 67.0% of responders.90,94,95 In part B,\npatients who had not received prior systemic treatment for\nmetastatic disease were enrolled; the ORR was 39.7%\n(16.4% CR) with 30.2% having a response lasting >6\nmonths; the median OS was 20.3 months. First-line avelu-\nmab treatment was generally well-tolerated, and no\ntreatment-related deaths or grade 4 adverse events (AEs)\noccurred.\nIn\nthe\npretreated\npopulation,\ngrade\n3-4\ntreatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were observed in 11.4% of\npatients. From December 2015 to March 2019, 494 patients\nreceived avelumab as a ﬁrst- or second-line treatment for\nMCC within an expanded access programme (EAP); the ORR\nwas 46.7% (22.9% CR) and the disease control rate was\n71.2%. Avelumab was also associated with long-lasting\ndisease\ncontrol\nand\na\npositive\neffect\non\nOS.90,94,95\nEmerging real-world data suggest that outcomes with ave-\nlumab in clinical practice are in line with those seen in\nclinical trials.96 Recently published global data from EAPs\nand retrospective studies reported ORRs ranging from\n29.1% to 72.1% [CR 15.8%-37.2%; PR 18.2%-42.1% and\nstable disease (SD) 7.1%-30.9%], with median progression-\nfree survival (PFS) ranging from 8.1 to 24.1 months.\nImportantly, immunosuppressed patients also beneﬁted\nfrom avelumab, with response rates equivalent to the\ngeneral population. The best outcomes were achieved when\navelumab was given as ﬁrst-line therapy. The most common\nAEs were fatigue and infusion-related reactions; autoim-\nmune hepatitis and thyroiditis were also observed.97\nPembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab, a humanised immuno-\nglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that selectively\nbinds PD-1 on the surface of T lymphocytes, has been\ntested as a ﬁrst-line treatment in patients with MCC.98,99 In\na phase II clinical trial (KEYNOTE-017), 50 patients received\npembrolizumab for up to 2 years. TRAEs of any grade\noccurred in 49 of 50 patients (98%) and 15 patients (30%)\nhad grade \u00053 TRAEs with one death due to pericardial and\npleural effusion. The ORR was 58%, with 30% of patients\nachieving a CR.

Although the effectiveness of\nnivolumabeipilimumab looks promising, data are immature\nand limited to a small sample size. It is also important to\nconsider the signiﬁcant risk of severe AEs in the elderly MCC\npopulation. Findings from the phase I/II CheckMate 358\ntrial also suggest that nivolumab is active as monotherapy\nin patients with advanced MCC. Among 25 treated patients\n(22 assessable), the ORR was 68% and the 3-month PFS and\nOS rates were 82% and 92%, respectively.77\nRetifanlimab. Retifanlimab is a humanised, hinge-stabilised\nIgG4k, anti-PD-1 antibody that is EMA and FDA approved\nfor the treatment of metastatic or recurrent locally\nadvanced MCC not amenable to curative surgery or RT\nbased on data from the phase II POD1UM-201 trial. In this\ntrial, retifanlimab treatment resulted in an ORR of 52% (95%\nCI 40% to 65%) in ChT-naive patients (N ¼ 65; CR 18% and\nPR 34%) with a median DoR between 1.1 months and >24.9\nmonths. Twenty-two\npercent\nof\npatients\nexperienced\nserious TRAEs, including fatigue, arrhythmia and pneumo-\nnitis, and 11% discontinued therapy due to AEs (the most\ncommon AEs were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus,\ndiarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and nausea).101\nChT\nAs there are no randomised trials in patients with MCC and\ndistant metastases, the impact of systemic ChT on survival is\nunclear. To date, available data are insufﬁcient to determine\nwhich of the different ChT regimens ensures the best PFS\nand OS in patients with metastatic MCC.\nChT regimens that have been used to treat patients with\nMCC include taxanes, topotecan, a combination of etopo-\nsideecisplatin, etoposideecarboplatin or cyclophosphamidee\ndoxorubicinevincristine.102 Response rates ranged from 20%\nto 75%, with higher response rates in the ﬁrst-line setting\n(53%-61%) versus the second-line setting (23%-45%); among\nresponders, the median DoRs were w2-9 months.76,103,104\nUnfortunately, in this fragile, elderly population, the occur-\nrence of toxic deaths limits ChT usage; toxic deaths were\nobserved in 3%-10% of patients.76,103,104 However, ChT might\nbe proposed after failure on immunotherapy or when\nimmunotherapy is contraindicated.\nTargeted therapies\nIn the UKMCC-01 trial, the efﬁcacy of pazopanib was\nassessed in 16 patients with MCC and a median age of 73\nyears (range 56-90 years).105 A clinical beneﬁt was reported\nin nine patients (three had a PR and six had SD) with a\nmedian duration of 8.0 weeks (range 1.3-38.4 weeks). The\ntrial was stopped due to slow accrual.105 A lack of activity\nand limited tolerance were also shown in a phase II trial\nwith cabozantinib in patients with recurrent/metastatic\nMCC after platinum failure.106 Based on published results,\nthe use of targeted therapy is not recommended.\nWith regard to radioligand therapy, although MCC\nfrequently\nexpresses\nsomatostatin\nreceptors,\nGa68-\nDOTATOC and Lu177-DOTATATE have only been studied\nin a few patients and further clinical trials are needed to\ndetermine their role in MCC.102,107 As such, they should not\ncurrently be considered as a standard of care.\nPalliative RT\nPalliative RT has mainly been assessed retrospectively. In a\nstudy applying an 8-Gy single fraction, a CR with almost 80%\nof in-ﬁeld lesion control was documented in 45% of pa-\ntients.87 Another study comparing 8 Gy as a single or\nmultiple fractions (3 \u0006 8 Gy) documented a CR in 10%\nversus 48% and a recurrence rate of 41% versus 5% (P ¼\n0.04), respectively.108 Patients of poor performance status\nshould be considered for a lower dose hypofractionation\nschedule (e.g. 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions),\nwhich can still achieve tumour regression.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Patients should receive individualised multimodality\ntreatment in referral centres for rare skin cancers with\naccess to clinical trials [III, B].\n\u0003 In oligometastatic disease progression, surgical removal\nor stereotactic irradiation of operable locoregional recur-\nrence or a single distant metastasis should be considered\nin ﬁt patients, although systemic immunotherapy should\nbe considered as the ﬁrst step [V, B].\n\u0003 Immunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab (III, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4; FDA and EMA approved),\npembrolizumab (III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA\napproved, not EMA approved), retifanlimab (III, A; FDA\nand EMA approved) and nivolumab (III, A; not EMA or\nFDA approved), are recommended as ﬁrst- and second-\nline treatments if no contraindications exist.\n\u0003 In cases of inoperable/disseminated disease, ﬁrst-line\ntreatment with an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody is suggested\nas it is more effective and safer than ChT [II, B].\n\u0003 In patients with contraindications or after failure of\nimmunotherapy, palliative RT and/or ChT may be op-\ntions, but their impact on OS is uncertain [III, B].\nPOPULATIONS OF SPECIAL CONSIDERATION\nSince MCC is present mainly in elderly patients, use of\ngeriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity assessments\nare important for decision making to achieve disease con-\ntrol and assure an acceptable quality of life. For patients\nwho are not medical candidates for surgery, RT alone may\nbe considered. However, in patients with inoperable/met-\nastatic disease, given the relatively good tolerability of ICIs,\nthese agents are the preferred choice of systemic therapy\nfor this subset of patients.\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n9\n\n---\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Use of geriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity as-\nsessments are important for decision making [V, A].\n\u0003 RT alone may be considered in patients not suitable for\nsurgery [IV, A].\n\u0003 In elderly patients with inoperable/metastatic disease,\nICIs are the preferred choice of systemic therapy [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nAfter primary surgical excision, local recurrence develops in\n27%-60% of patients, regional nodal involvement is reported\nin 45%-91% of patients and distant metastases are found in\n18%-52%.42,109,110 Risk factors for recurrence include immu-\nnosuppression, advancing age, advancing stage of disease\n(stage II-IV), individuals assigned male at birth, non-SLN\nmetastases, MCPyV-negative status, as well as additional\nfactors as determined by the treating physicians. No formal\nclinical\ntrials\nhave\nevaluated\nthe\noptimal\nsurveillance\nschedule in MCC, either in terms of frequency or type of\ndiagnostic examinations. As the risk of relapse is higher in the\nﬁrst 2-3 years after initial treatment (40%-50% nodal and 33%\ndistant metastases),15 more intense follow-up should be\napplied in this period. Follow-up examinations are recom-\nmended every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, and then\nevery 6 months until year 5. After 5 years of observation, a\ngeneral physical examination is recommended every 12\nmonths lifelong, including a complete skin check-up. Physical\nexamination should include total-body skin examination and\nLN assessment with particular attention to the scar region,\nincluding the primary site, in-transit region and regional LN\nbasin. Distant metastases may develop in a wide range of\nanatomical locations; thus, routine cross-sectional imaging\nmay be proposed in higher-risk patients.\nThe radiological examination may be either a diagnostic CT\nof the thorax/abdomen/pelvis (and head/neck for patients\nwith head and neck primaries) or whole-body PETeCT, un-\ndertaken every 6-12 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, with ul-\ntrasound scans used for local LN assessment. After year 3,\nimaging studies should be carried out as clinically indicated.\nPatients with MCC have a higher risk for developing another\nskin cancer9,15,39,111,112; therefore, education regarding self-\nexamination of the whole skin surface is valuable. The role\nof MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncertain but it\nmay be utilised in patients who are seropositive at base-\nline.50,113,114 The early detection of a locoregional relapse\nmay be cured by surgery. However, inoperable/metastatic\nrelapse should be treated as metastatic disease, as described\nin the previous section.115-117 Therapy should be coordinated\nby an MDT at the referral centre.87,118,119\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Follow-up examinations are recommended in radically\ntreated patients every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years,\nand then every 6 months up to year 5. After 5 years of\nobservation,\na\ngeneral\nphysical\nexamination\nis\nrecommended every 12 months lifelong, including a\ncomplete skin check-up [IV, A].\n\u0003 Patient education regarding self-examination of the\nwhole skin is valuable as patients with MCC have a\nhigher risk of developing another skin cancer [IV, A].\n\u0003 The role of MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncer-\ntain, but it may be utilised in patients who are seropos-\nitive at baseline [V, A].\n\u0003 Routine cross-sectional imaging may be proposed in\nhigher-risk patients [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG has been developed by ESMO in partnership with\nEURACAN, in accordance with the ESMO standard operating\nprocedures for CPG development (http://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-GuidelinesMethodology).\nThe\nrelevant\nliterature has been selected by the expert authors. The\nguideline is conceived to provide a standard approach to\ndiagnosis, treatment and survivorship of MCC. Due to the\nrarity of MCC incidence, prospective and randomised\nstudies are limited; therefore, the basis of this guideline was\nmainly\ndata\nfrom\nretrospective,\nobservational\ncohort\nstudies, both institutional and cancer registry-based, often\nwith heterogeneous results. These studies have many limi-\ntations, such as selection bias, confounding factors, limited\nand missing data and lack of randomisation. Recommended\ninterventions are intended to correspond to the ‘standard’\napproaches according to current consensus among the Eu-\nropean multidisciplinary MCC community of experts. These\nare represented by the members of the ESMO Melanoma\nFaculty and experts appointed by all institutions belonging\nto the Rare Skin Cancer domain of EURACAN. Experimental\ninterventions considered to be beneﬁcial are labelled as\n‘investigational’. Other non-standard approaches may be\nproposed to the single patient as ‘options’ for a shared\npatientephysician decision in conditions of uncertainty as\nlong as some supporting evidence (though not conclusive) is\navailable. Algorithms accompany the text, covering the\nmain typical presentations of disease, and are meant to\nguide the user throughout the text.

The objective of the initial diagnostic\nwork-up of UKP-NENs is to identify the occult primary\ntumour. Metastatic patterns can be indicative of primary\ntumour location. The most common site for the occult pri-\nmary is the ileum followed by the pancreas.16 Ileal NETs\noften present as a mesenteric mass on computed tomog-\nraphy (CT).16 Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging (SRI)\nwith\ngallium-68-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-\ntetraacetic acid-labelled somatostatin analogue ([68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSA)epositron emission tomography (PET)eCT is the\nmost sensitive technique for NETs, detecting an occult pri-\nmary in 61% of cases.17 If SRI is uninformative, [18F]\nF-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)ePETeCT and endoscopy\ntechniques can be useful (see Supplementary Table S1,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664, and Section 3 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664).\nFor\nNECs,\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose\n(FDG)ePETeCT may be used. The presence of secretory\nsyndromes and elevated hormone levels may also facilitate\nidentiﬁcation of the primary NET. A minimum panel of\npeptide\nhormones\nshould\nbe\nmeasured\nin\npatients\nwith\nUKP-NETs\n[calcitonin,\nmetanephrines\nand\n5-\nhydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)]. Other hormones may\nbe measured depending on symptoms (see Supplementary\nTable S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664,\nand\nSection\n3\nof\nthe\nSupplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664). Chromogranin A has demonstrated a sensi-\ntivity of 71% and speciﬁcity of 84%-85% for the detection of\ngastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs.18\nIt is important to distinguish between primary GUGy-\nNETs and metastasis in the GUGy system from primary tu-\nmours in another site. Indeed, ovarian, testicular and renal\nmetastases occur in patients with GEP or lung NETs.\nSymptoms result from local inﬁltration in patients with\nmore aggressive GUGy-NENs and performance status (PS)\ndeterioration. Less than 15% of GUGy-NETs present with\nhormone-related symptoms (mostly carcinoid syndrome).1\nHN-NENs induce non-speciﬁc symptoms such as hoarse-\nness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, nasal obstruction, epistaxis and\nconductive hearing loss.19,20 Laryngeal NENs arise from the\nsupraglottic region in 85% of cases.8 Middle-ear NENs appear\nas a retrotympanic mass extending into the ossicles, mastoid,\nauditory canal and Eustachian tube.9,19 Sinonasal NENs occur\nin the ethmoid (64% of cases), nasal cavity (32%) and maxil-\nlary sinus (14%). The most common metastatic sites are the\nlymph nodes, lungs, liver and bones.21 Skin metastases can be\nextremely painful and suggestive of laryngeal NETs.22 Func-\ntional syndromes are rare and include carcinoid syndrome,\nsyndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hor-\nmone, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome and\nLamberteEaton myasthenic syndrome.23\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients\nwith UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs should be discussed in a\nNEN multidisciplinary tumour board (MTB) [V, A].\n\u0003 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs should be classiﬁed and\ngraded according to the common IARCeWHO 2018\nconsensus classiﬁcation together with the organ-speciﬁc\nWHO classiﬁcation [V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, IHC should be carried out to exclude para-\ngangliomas (cytokeratin) and to identify the primary [as a\nminimum: thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and\ncaudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX-2)]. Calcitonin, serotonin\nand other IHC markers may be used [IV, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, secretory syn-\ndromes should be diagnosed based on hormone-related\nsymptoms. As a minimum, metanephrines, 5-HIAA and\ncalcitonin should be measured in those with UKP-NETs\n[V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, cross-sectional imaging may identify meta-\nstatic patterns suggestive of a primary site (e.g. a mesen-\nteric mass indicative of an ileal NET) [IV, A].

FDGePETeCT may be helpful\nin NENs with a higher proliferation index (G3 NETs\nand NECs) [V, B]. [18F]F-DOPAePETeCT may also detect\nan ileum primary, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma\nin patients with UKP-NETs [V, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-NECs, searches for the primary\nshould not delay treatment intervention, apart from cuta-\nneous examination for Merkel-cell carcinoma and IHC for\ncytokeratin 20 and Merkel-cell polyomavirus, if available\n[V, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nAdequate staging of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs relies on\ncross-sectional imaging and nuclear medicine techniques.\nCT scans are effective for the detection of lung metastases\nwhereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is better for\nliver and bone metastases. MRI is also preferred in young\npatients as radiation exposure is lower. SRI has a high\nsensitivity for NETs and should be part of the initial work-\nup. SSTR scintigraphy is less sensitive and should only be\ncarried out when SRIePETeCT is not available. Whole body\nCT, or FDGePETeCT in case of limited tumour burden, are\nrecommended for the staging of G2-3 NETs and NECs.24\nStaging of middle-ear HN-NENs is based on the system\nproposed by Marinelli et al.19 while staging of GUGy- and\nHN-NENs is based on the eighth edition of the Union for\nInternational Cancer Control (UICC) TNM (tumourenodee\nmetastasis) classiﬁcation25 (see Supplementary Tables S2-\nS10, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). There is no staging classiﬁcation for UKP-NENs\nunless an occult primary is identiﬁed by the initial diag-\nnostic work-up.\nPrognosis for all NENs relies on pathological grading and\nstaging. In patients with metastases, differentiation, WHO\ngrade, age, PS, tumour burden, SRI and/or FDG uptake, the\npresence of a functional syndrome at baseline and tumour\ngrowth rate should be considered for optimal risk assessment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 CT and/or MRI are recommended for staging. MRI should\nbe mainly considered in young patients to reduce irradi-\nation anddusing late arterial phase imagingdimprove\ndetection of hepatic, pancreatic, brain and bone NETs\n[III, A].\n\u0003 SRIePET is recommended for initial and preoperative\nstaging, and when indicated for restaging [V, A].\n\u0003 FDGePETeCT can be used for staging G2-3 NETs and\nNECs [IV, B].\n\u0003 Major independent prognostic factors are disease stage\n(TNM) and pathological features including differentiation\nand WHO grade [IV, A]. Age, PS, tumour burden, the pres-\nence of functional syndromes and tumour growth rate\nare additional prognostic factors [IV, B].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nPatients with UKP-NENs may present with lymph node\nmetastases without the detection of a primary tumour or\ndistant metastases. For G1-3 UKP-NETs, radical resection of\nlocoregional\ndisease\nis the\npreferred\ntreatment\n(see\nFigure 1). While searching for an occult primary, the site of\nlymph node metastasis may guide surgical exploration (e.g.\nan involved mesenteric node is suggestive of an ileal pri-\nmary). There is no evidence to support adjuvant therapy\nfollowing curative resection of NETs. For UKP-NECs, down-\nstaging of locoregional disease with chemotherapy (ChT)\nand/or radiotherapy (RT) may be considered before surgery.\nSome patients with NECs, particularly with isolated inguinal\nor neck nodes, may have prolonged disease control and\nsurvival following multimodal treatment including sur-\ngery.26 In this setting, Merkel-cell carcinoma should be ruled\nout. It is unclear whether post-operative treatment of NECs\nimproves\noutcomes,\nbut\nfour cycles of carboplatine\netoposide may be considered, particularly if neoadjuvant\nChT has not been used.27\nThere are no prospective data on the management of\nlocal and locoregional disease in patients with GUGy-NENs.\nRecommendations are therefore extrapolated from site-\nspeciﬁc ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs).28 For\nGUGy-NETs,\nupfront\nradical\nsurgery\nwithout\nadjuvant\ntreatment is recommended when feasible (see Figure 2);\nhowever, a conservative surgical approach should be dis-\ncussed whenever possible, particularly for low-grade local-\nised NETs. The role of adjuvant therapy for G3 GUGy-NETs is\nalso unknown. For GUGy-NECs, multimodal therapy should\nalways be discussed for localised disease. Further details\nregarding the management of local and locoregional GUGy-\nNENs are available in Section 4 of the Supplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664.\nFor HN-NENs, locoregional treatment depends on the\nprimary site (see Figure 3). In the larynx, NETs are mainly\nsupraglottic and their sensitivity to ChT and RT may be low.\nBased\non\nretrospective\ndata,\nradical\nresection\nafter\ncompletion of whole body imaging (including PETeCT) is\nrecommended whenever possible with homolateral neck\ndissection, as it may lower the risk of regional lymph node\nrecurrence.8 Post-operative RT should be discussed in a\nmultidisciplinary meeting, particularly for G2 NETs.8 For\nlaryngeal NECs, treatment relies mainly on ChT and RT8;\nsurgery may be discussed in selected cases.29 For sinonasal\nNETs, surgery was associated with longer survival in retro-\nspective series.30,31 The role of prophylactic neck dissection\nis unknown. Post-operative RT should be discussed but\nthere is no evidence that it prevents locoregional relapse.\nFor sinonasal NECs, treatment should be multimodal.\nRetrospective data suggest that induction ChT is beneﬁ-\ncial,10 in combination with RT in most cases and surgery in\nselected cases.21,31 Most middle-ear tumours are NETs.\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment,19,32 but complete\nresection with no tumour at the margin (R0) is challenging\nand there is a risk of locoregional relapse when ossicles are\nJ. Hadoux et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\n3\n\n---\ninvolved. There are no data on post-operative RT; however,\nRT may be discussed for patients with a higher risk of\nrelapse due to adherence to important neurovascular\nstructures. RT might prevent extension to the skull base and\nsubsequent\ndebilitating\ncomplications.\nThis\nmust\nbe\nbalanced against the risk of long-term RT-induced toxicity.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-NETs with locoregional disease, the\naim of surgical resection with exploration is to identify\nand treat the primary tumour with microscopic radical\nintent [V, A].\n\u0003 For GUGy-NETs, surgery of the primary tumour and nodes\nwith microscopic radical intent (according to site-speciﬁc\nESMO CPGs) is the treatment of choice for local and\nlocoregional disease, irrespective of grade [V, A]. A con-\nservative surgical approach should be discussed when-\never feasible, particularly in low-grade, early-stage NETs\n[V, B].\n\u0003 For laryngeal and sinonasal NETs, surgery of the primary\ntumour with microscopic radical intent and homolateral\ntherapeutic neck dissection is recommended whenever\npossible [IV, A].\n\u0003 Adjuvant treatment cannot be recommended for UKP-\nNETs [V, D] but adjuvant RT may be discussed for GUGy-\nNETs in patients with microscopic (R1) or macroscopic\n(R2) tumour at the margin and/or G3 disease [V, C].\n\u0003 For HN-NETs, adjuvant RT may be discussed after radical\nresection, particularly in case of locoregional spread,\nnon-R0 resection and G2 disease; however, the beneﬁt\nin terms of local control is unknown [V, C].\n\u0003 For locoregional sinonasal NECs, neoadjuvant ChT with\nplatinumeetoposide may be considered before surgical\nresection [IV, C].\n\u0003 For NECs treated with radical surgery, adjuvant therapy\nwith four cycles of platinumeetoposide may be consid-\nered [V, B].\n\u0003 Neoadjuvant ChT may be an option for UKP- and GUGy-\nNECs [V, C].\n\u0003 Combining RT with ChT is recommended for HN-NECs [IV,\nA] and could be discussed for UKP- and GUGy-NECs as\ndeﬁnitive or (neo)adjuvant treatment [V, C].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nFor UKP-NETs there are few clinical trials with low patient\nnumbers and for UKP-NECs there are only retrospective\nFigure 1.

For advanced or metastatic\nGUGy- and HN-NENs, neither retrospective nor prospective\nstudies are available. Thus, recommendations for the man-\nagement of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs are based on the\nmanagement of NENs of GEP or lung origin and so systemic\ntreatments approved for GEP-NETs are used off-label in this\nsetting.28 When an occult primary is identiﬁed or suspected\n(such as a mesenteric mass from an ileal NET), its man-\nagement should follow the dedicated guideline.\nTreatment decisions (see Figure 4) should be based on\ncomprehensive multidisciplinary characterisation of the\ntumour (see ‘Staging and risk assessment’). In particular,\nWHO grade, differentiation (well versus poor),33 SSTR status\nbased on SRIePETeCT24 and presence of a functional syn-\ndrome should be considered.\nSurgery and locoregional therapies. Surgery should be\ndiscussed\nfor\nslowly\nproliferating\n(oligo)metastatic\ntumours in patients with G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs;\nthis includes surgical exploration for occult primary\nidentiﬁcation in case of UKP-NETs.34 Metastatic spread in\nHN-NETs frequently involves the skin, particularly in those\narising from the larynx.20,22 Skin metastases are usually\nmultiple and small in size, causing hard-to-treat pain and\ndiscomfort, which affects patients’ quality of life. In most\ncases, they are resistant to systemic treatment. Repeated\nlocoregional therapies may be used, including surgical\nresection, electrochemotherapy35 and RT for the largest\ntumours.22\nSomatostatin analogues. Two phase III trials [CLARINET\n(lanreotide) and PROMID (octreotide)] have reported longer\nprogression-free survival (PFS) or time to progression with\nsomatostatin analogue (SSA) treatment compared with\nplacebo in patients with metastatic GEP-NETs. Both studies\nincluded some patients with UKP-NETs but none with GUGy-\nor HN-NETs.36,37 Extrapolating the results from CLARINET\nand PROMID, SSAs may be recommended for tumour\nFigure 2.

Beyond SSAs, studies\nexploring the role of telotristat ethyl39 or interferon-a (IFN-\na)40 for carcinoid syndrome control included patients with\nany primary tumour site so their use is also applicable to\nUKP-NETs. No data are available on the treatment of\ncarcinoid syndrome associated with GUGy- or HN-NETs.\nManagement of carcinoid syndrome should follow the Eu-\nropean Neuroendocrine Tumor Society 2022 guidance pa-\nper on carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid heart disease41;\nmanagement of Cushing syndrome should follow the ESMO\nCPG on lung and thymic carcinoids.28\nTargeted therapy. Based on data from the RADIANT-2,42\nRADIANT-343 and RADIANT-444 trials (NETs of various pri-\nmaries), everolimus monotherapy may be considered as\nﬁrst-line treatment for SSTR-negative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and\nHN-NETs, or as second-line treatment after SSAs in patients\nwith progressive disease. The RADIANT studies, however,\nincluded only 36 patients with UKP-NETs and no patients\nwith GUGy- or HN-NETs. Based on the randomised CABI-\nNET,45 AXINET46 and SANET-ep47 trials, antiangiogenic\nmultikinase inhibitors (MKIs) may be considered as alter-\nnatives to everolimus for ﬁrst-line treatment of SSTR-\nnegative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NETs, or for second-\nline treatment after SSAs in patients with progressive dis-\nease. These studies included 34-49 patients with UKP-NETs\nor NETs of other origin not otherwise speciﬁed (see Sec-\ntion 5 of the Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nChT. In patients with progressive G2 (Ki-67 >10%) and G3\nNETs, alkylating agent-based and oxaliplatin-based ChT\nregimens may be considered. Most data for management of\nG3 NETs with these regimens are from patients with\npancreatic NETs, with response rates of up to 30% and\nmedian PFS of 8-16 months.48 Loss of O-6-methylguanine-\nDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression or promoter\nhypermethylation may prompt use of alkylating agent-\nbased ChT (see Section 5 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664).49,50 For the management of NECs, ﬁrst-line\ncarboplatineetoposide or cisplatineetoposide is recom-\nmended based on retrospective series showing response\nrates of 40%-60%, median PFS of 4-6 months and median\noverall survival (OS) of 12 months.2,10,21,29,51 Carboplatine\netoposide or cisplatineetoposide should not be used for\nwell-differentiated NETs, regardless of grade.33,51\nFigure 3.

Patients with UKP-,\nGUGy- and HN-NETs were excluded from the randomised\nphase III NETTER-1 study, which evaluated peptide receptor\nradionuclide therapy (PRRT) with [177Lu]Lutetium-DOTA-\nTyr3-octreotate in patients with mid-gut NETs.52 Retro-\nspective studies have reported equivalent efﬁcacy with\nPRRT in patients with UKP-NETs versus other primaries\n(w30% response rate and PFS of 20-25 months), thereby\nsupporting its use.53 There are no retrospective studies on\nthe use of PRRT in GUGy- or HN-NETs. PRRT may be an\noption for patients with SSTR-positive UKP-, GUGy- or HN-\nNETs who have progressed under SSA treatment.\nPrecision medicine. The ESMO Precision Medicine Working\nGroup recommends determination of tumour mutational\nburden (TMB) in NENs,54 following results from the TMB-high\ncohort of the KEYNOTE-158 basket trial of pembrolizumab.55\nIn this study, two of ﬁve patients with TMB-high NENs had a\nresponse (40% response rate compared with 1% in those\nwith non-TMB-high NENs); however, no immunotherapy is\napproved in Europe for TMB-high tumours and the avail-\nability of next-generation sequencing for patients with NENs\nis limited.

With the exception\nof UKP-NENs (see Section 6 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664),\nthere are no data on long-term follow-up. Follow-up carries\nthe risk of excessive radiation exposure, so low-dose CT (for\nlung metastases) or MRI should be used whenever possible,\nespecially in patients for whom prolonged follow-up is\nanticipated. There is a consensus for the use of molecular\nimaging for SSTR-positive NETs, especially SRI with [68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSAePETeCT, at initial staging and for post-surgical\nrestaging, but not for routine follow-up.24 Molecular imag-\ning may play a role, however, in the follow-up of secondary\nlesions that are hard to evaluate with conventional imaging,\nsuch as peritoneal carcinomatosis and bone metastases.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected G1 and low G2 (Ki-\n67 <10%) UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-\ndose CT or MRI is recommended every 6 months for\n2 years, annually for years 3-5 and every second year\nthereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected G2 (Ki-67 \u000510%)\nand G3 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-\ndose CT or MRI is recommended every 3 months for\n2 years, every 6 months in year 3, annually for years\n4-5 and every second year thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or\nHN-NECs,\nfollow-up\nshould\nbe\ncarried\nout\nevery\n2-3 months for 2 years, every 6 months in year 3 and\nthen discussed on a case-by-case basis thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or HN-\nNENs, the best molecular imaging technique (according to\nSRIePET and/or FDGePETeCT positivity at initial staging)\nis recommended 6 months after resection and then in\ncase of unclear or abnormal imaging results [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual\nor metastatic disease, restaging is recommended every\n4-6 months [G1 and low G2 (Ki-67 <10%) NETs] or every\n3-4 months [G2 (Ki-67 \u000510%) and G3 NETs]; the interval\ncan be increased in case of stable disease [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual or\nmetastatic disease, systematic follow-up using PET imaging\nis not recommended but may be considered in case of\ndoubtful or abnormal imaging results, increasing bio-\nmarkers, clinical suspicion of new metastasis (particularly\nin the bone) and/or depending on the metastatic sites\nand their measurability using conventional imaging, espe-\ncially when locoregional therapies are discussed [V, C].\n\u0003 Patientswithdisseminateddiseasemaybeneﬁtfromreferral\nto specialised palliative care units for appropriate pain treat-\nment, psychosocial support and rehabilitation [II, B].\nPARATHYROID CARCINOMA\nIncidence and epidemiology\nParathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare neoplasm, accounting\nfor <1% of primary hyperparathyroidism cases.56 PC affects\nmale and female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of\n50 years. PC occurs as a sporadic form, or less frequently as\nfamilial forms such as hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour\nsyndrome (HPT-JT; w15% of cases) linked to a germline\nmutation in the CDC73/HRPT2 gene.57 Rarely, it can occur as\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 (MEN1) or type\n2A (MEN2A).58 Even in the absence of a family history,\n20%-40% of patients with apparently sporadic PC have a\ngermline CDC73 mutation.58,59\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nDiagnosis.\nClinical presentation. PC can be suspected in patients\nwho present with severe primary hyperparathyroidism\ncharacterised by severe hypercalcaemia-related symptoms\nand markedly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.\nLess than 10% of patients have normal serum calcium and\nPTH levels and present with a non-functional PC with only\nlocal symptoms, such as a palpable cervical mass, hoarse-\nness, dysphagia or dyspnoea.60\nLaboratory studies. Most patients with PC have markedly\nhigh levels of calcium (>14 mg/dl or 3.5 mmol/l) and non-\nsuppressed intact PTH 1-84 molecule (3-10 times above the\nupper limit of normal). The combined presence of high\nserum calcium (>3 mmol/l) and a parathyroid lesion >3 cm\n(the so-called ‘>3, >3 rule’), should raise suspicion of PC.\nSome patients with PC may overproduce N-terminal PTH\nfragment and have elevated serum and urinary levels of\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin; their determination could\nbe useful for differential diagnosis with benign adenoma,\nalthough this has only been tested in a small series.61\nImaging. Neck US is the ﬁrst-line imaging technique for\nthe diagnosis of parathyroid lesions. Its sensitivity varies\nfrom 67% to 96% with a positive predictive value of 89.7%-\n97%62; however, there are no speciﬁc patterns of malig-\nnancy (see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with cytology and\nwashout PTH measurement can help to differentiate from\nlesions of other origins (e.g. thyroid, distant metastases\nfrom other tumours).63 Complications associated with the\nFNA procedure (including occasional seeding) are rare.64\nContrast-enhanced CT and MRI can be used in highly\nsuspicious cases to evaluate inﬁltration of surrounding tissue\nbut are not routinely carried out for differential diagnosis.65\nParathyroid\nscintigraphy\nwith\n[99mTc]Tc-sesta-methox-\nyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) single-photon emission CT (SPECT)\nor SPECTeCT, in combination with neck US, is the procedure\nof choice for preoperative identiﬁcation of hyperfunctioning\nparathyroids. During initial PC evaluation, the sensitivity and\ndiagnostic accuracy of [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI scintigraphy are\nJ. Hadoux et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\n9\n\n---\n\u000580% when used with neck US or CT. Nevertheless, there are\nno clear scintigraphic parameters that allow a real preoper-\native differential diagnosis between PC and adenoma.\nPET procedures such as [11C]-methionineePETeCT and\n[18F]-cholineePETeCT are effective for the diagnosis of pri-\nmary hyperparathyroidism but their added value in the dif-\nferential diagnosis between PC and adenoma is unknown.66\nPathology. Histological diagnosis of PC is based on the 2022\nWHO classiﬁcation criteria: (i) vascular invasion; (ii) lymphatic\ninvasion; (iii) perineural (intraneural) invasion; (iv) local ma-\nlignant invasion into adjacent anatomical structures; or (v)\nhistologically or cytologically documented metastatic disease.\nThe morphology of PC is usually reminiscent of parathyroid\nadenoma or hyperplasia.67,68 Features suggestive of malig-\nnancy and warranting a diagnosis of atypical adenoma [also\ncalled parathyroid neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential\nor atypical parathyroid tumour (APT)] are macroscopically\nevident necrosis, size >3 cm, weight >500 mg, mitotic index\n>5 mitoses/2 mm2 and the presence of atypical mitosis67,69\n(see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Some rare\nvariants have been described, including oncocytic carcinomas\nand carcinosarcomas with more aggressive behaviour.70,71\nAlthough PC generally shows a higher proliferation index\n(Ki-67 6%-9% compared with <4% in adenoma), there is no\npredeﬁned Ki-67 cut-off to support or exclude a PC diagnosis.\nThe International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)\nhas issued a dataset on PC and APT that covers PC grading,\nconsidering it high grade in the presence of sheets of pleo-\nmorphic enlarged nuclei, coagulative necrosis, abnormal\nmitosis and/or increased proliferation rate.69\nMolecular biology. The most frequent molecular alteration\nin PC is on the CDC73 gene (40%-50% of cases). Phospha-\ntidylinositol-3-kinase\n(PI3K)eprotein\nkinase\nb\n(AKT)e\nmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the most\nfrequently altered pathway (40%-80% of cases).65,72,73 IHC\nevaluation of paraﬁbromin loss of expression to identify a\ndouble-hit inactivation of the CDC73 gene is a recognised\nancillary diagnostic method for malignancy, as is evaluation\nof loss of p27, other types of cyclins or cell cycle regulators,\ngalectin-3 and protein gene product 9.5.69,74\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Genetic testing for germline CDC73 mutation should be\ncarried out to rule out HPT-JT in all patients with PC,\nincluding those without a family history [IV, A].\n\u0003 The combined presence of markedly elevated serum cal-\ncium [>12 mg/dl (>3 mmol/l)] and parathyroid lesions\n>3 cm should raise suspicion of PC [IV, B].\n\u0003 US of the neck should be carried out to assess lesions sus-\npicious for PC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are used to evaluate\nlocoregional invasion before planning surgery [V, A].\n\u0003 FNA cytology and washout PTH measurements can be\nused to differentiate PC from other neck or thyroid nod-\nules but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [V, C].\n\u0003 [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBIeSPECT may be useful for the diag-\nnosis of PC but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [IV, C].\n\u0003 PC pathology reporting should follow the 2022 WHO clas-\nsiﬁcation (ﬁfth edition) and ICCR template [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe prognosis for patients with PC is variable, with 5- and 10-\nyear OS rates after surgery of w80% and 40%-80%, respec-\ntively. Good prognosis is associated with early diagnosis and\nradicality of initial surgery, whereas poor prognosis is mainly\nrelated to older age and the presence of lymph node me-\ntastases.75-79\nStaging is based on the eighth edition of the American\nJoint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system (see\nSupplementary Table S11, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).80 Only 15%-30% of patients\nhave level VI lymph node metastases and one-third have\ndistant metastases, most commonly in the lung, liver or\nbone. The detection of locoregional or distant metastases is\nbased on neck US, thoracic and abdominal CT, or MRI.\nAmong nuclear medicine techniques, total body acquisi-\ntion with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI can identify possible extra-\ncervical uptake and unexpected lesions. FDGePETeCT can\nalso be applied as PC generally shows high FDG uptake. It\ncan be used to complement conventional imaging in the\ninitial staging and for residual or relapsing disease, albeit\nbased on limited data.81 Other PET tracers such as [11C]-\nmethionineePETeCT and [18F]-cholineePETeCT have not\nbeen validated for routine staging of PC.66,81,82\nRecommendations\n\u0003 PC staging should follow the eighth edition of the AJCC\nTNM system [IV, A].\n\u0003 Cross-sectional imaging is the reference method [V, A] but\nadditional FDGePETeCT may improve staging accuracy\n[IV, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nManagement of hypercalcaemia. Medical management of\nhypercalcaemia is the main treatment for patients awaiting\nsurgery and those with inoperable PC. Cinacalcet, a potent\nsecond-generation calcium mimetic, is effective for con-\ntrolling hypercalcaemia in patients with inoperable or\npersistent disease.83,84 The greatest reductions in calcium\nwere reported in patients with the highest serum calcium\nlevels before therapy. The cornerstones of treatment for\nsevere or symptomatic hypercalcaemia are intravenous sa-\nline hydration and bisphosphonate administration (see\nSection 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nSurgery. Surgery is the recommended ﬁrst-line treatment\nfor PC (Figure 6).85 Inadequate and non-radical surgery\nrepresent the strongest prognostic factors for recurrence\nand mortality. In case of high suspicion of PC, en bloc\nremoval of the parathyroid lesion avoiding capsule rupture\nand local seeding, homolateral thyroid lobo-isthmectomy\nand central node dissection are recommended.86\nESMO Open\nJ.

Analysis of data from the National Cancer Database\nidentiﬁed 885 patients with PC who underwent surgery\nbetween 2004 and 2016, including 126 (14.2%) who also\nreceived external beam RT. The latter group had a higher\nfrequency of extensive regional disease, nodal metastases\nand residual microscopic disease. The 5-year OS rate was\n85.3% with a median follow-up of 60.8 months. RT was not\nassociated with a difference in OS based on multivariate\nanalysis87; however, small series from highly specialised\ntertiary centres have reported lower locoregional relapse\nrates in patients undergoing adjuvant RT,88-90 particularly in\npatients with R1 or R2 resection.90 Although not recom-\nmended for all patients, adjuvant RT should be discussed in\nthe case of R1 or R2 resection and/or lymph node metas-\ntasis (Nþ) and/or persistent hypercalcaemia.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Medical treatment of hypercalcaemia is required before\nsurgery [V, A].\n\u0003 Cinacalcet is recommended to control hypercalcaemia [II,\nA].\n\u0003 Hydration with saline infusion, at a starting dose of 200-\n500 ml/h, is the ﬁrst step in the treatment of severe or\nsymptomatic hypercalcaemia [IV, A].\n\u0003 The bone antiresorptive drug zoledronic acid is recom-\nmended as ﬁrst-line treatment and should be preferred\nover pamidronate for severe or symptomatic hypercalcae-\nmia [II, A].\n\u0003 Denosumab is recommended in patients with resistant\nhypercalcaemia [III, A; FDA approved, not EMA approved].\n\u0003 When a preoperative diagnosis of PC is made, upfront\nsurgery with en bloc removal of the parathyroid lesion\n(avoiding capsule rupture and local seeding), homolateral\nthyroid lobo-isthmectomy and central node dissection is\nrecommended [IV, A].\n\u0003 In case of pathological diagnosis of PC after parathyroid-\nectomy,\nreoperation\nwith\nipsilateral\nthyroid\nlobo-\nisthectomy and\ncentral node\ndissection\nshould\nbe\ndiscussed within 1 month of initial surgery [IV, A].\nFigure 6.

Brown\ntumours (osteolytic lesions of the bone caused by hyper-\nparathyroidism) should be differentiated from bone me-\ntastases, but this may be difﬁcult as they can show FDG\nuptake; MRI can be useful to better characterise bone le-\nsions.91 In case of known distant metastases, the probability\nof achieving a complete response is low and frequently only\nlocoregional treatments can control the disease.92 Cina-\ncalcet should be continued in case of persistent severe\nhypercalcaemia.\nData on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in PC are\nscarce with only 79 patients reported in the literature be-\ntween 1898 and 2018.93 A recent pooled analysis of all\nmetastatic PC cases reported that the most frequent\ntreatments were dacarbazine or anthracycline-containing\nChT and antiangiogenic drugs.93 The most frequent ChT\nprotocols included dacarbazine monotherapy, dacarbazinee\n5-FU, cyclophosphamide monotherapy or methotrexatee\ndoxorubicinecyclophosphamideelomustine, but response\nrates were low.93 Most cases in which antiangiogenics were\nused involved sorafenib.94,95 PC is usually radioresistant;\ndespite limited data showing that RT can be applied as\nadjuvant therapy to reduce local recurrence, its role is\nmainly palliative.85\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The efﬁcacy of systemic treatment in advanced and met-\nastatic disease is limited; thus, whenever possible,\ndebulking surgery and/or locoregional treatments should\nbe discussed to control tumour burden and hormonal\nsecretion [V, A].\n\u0003 First-line systemic treatment may involve antiangiogenic\ndrugs [V, B] or alkylating agent-based ChT (dacarbazine,\ntemozolomide or streptozocin combined with 5-FU or\ncapecitabine) [V, C].\n\u0003 Inclusion in clinical trials should be prioritised whenever\npossible [V, A].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nThe reported risk of recurrence is w50% at 2-5 years (based\nmainly\non\ncases\nin\nwhich\nnon-radical\nsurgery\nwas\nused).56,75-77,79 Laboratory follow-up includes lifelong mea-\nsurement of calcium and PTH every 3 months, although\nlonger intervals (up to 4-6 months) are an option.79 Pro-\ngressive and repeated increases in PTH and calcium levels\nare suggestive of PC recurrence and cross-sectional imaging\n(neck US, CT and/or MRI) should be carried out to identify\nthe site of recurrence. There is no validated role for scin-\ntigraphy with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI in the follow-up of PC.\nRecurrences and distant metastases can be small or\nbelow the resolution of imaging (<1 cm), and occasionally\nPC can evolve towards aggressive and rapidly progressive\nforms and lose the ability for signiﬁcant uptake of [99mTc]Tc-\nsesta-MIBI. In these cases, FDGePET can complement\nconventional imaging.\nThe identiﬁcation of a germline CDC73 mutation should\nprompt periodic screening for tumours associated with HPT-\nJT (ossifying ﬁbromas of the mandible or maxilla, benign\nand malignant uterine involvement, renal cysts).58 Genetic\ntesting should be carried out in all family members of\naffected individuals. In ﬁrst-degree relatives, measurement\nof\nserum\ncalcium\nlevels\nand\nUS\nmonitoring\nare\nrecommended.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Lifelong laboratory follow-up, including measurement of\ncalcium and PTH, is recommended every 3-4 months\nduring the ﬁrst 2 years, every 6 months during the sub-\nsequent 3 years and annually thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 In case of calcium and/or PTH elevation, neck US and CT\nscan of the neck, chest and abdomen together with a\nneck MRI are recommended [V, A]. FDGePET can be pro-\nposed to complete work-up, especially in rapidly pro-\ngressing cases [V, C].\nINTRATHYROID THYMIC CARCINOMA\nIncidence and epidemiology\nPreviously known as carcinoma showing thymus-like dif-\nferentiation (CASTLE), intrathyroid thymic carcinoma (ITC) is\nrare and believed to arise from the thymic remnants or\nbranchial pouch96 and, more rarely, from major salivary\nglands.97 ITC accounts for <0.15% of thyroid neoplasms.98\nFemales are affected slightly more frequently than males\nand the median age at diagnosis is 50 years.99\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nITC presents as a slow-growing neck mass with hard con-\nsistency and poor mobility, located at the lower poles of the\nthyroid gland. It appears as a cold nodule on thyroid scin-\ntigraphy and as a solid, heterogenous and hypoechoic mass\non US. Most patients have locally advanced disease with\ninvasion of surrounding structures, including the recurrent\nlaryngeal nerve, strap muscle, trachea, oesophagus, soft\ntissues and skin. Cervical lymph nodes are frequently\ninvolved but few patients have distant metastases.99 At\ndiagnosis, w20% of patients have dyspnoea, dysphagia,\nright laryngeal nerve paralysis and pain. FNA does not\nprovide a deﬁnitive diagnosis; histological conﬁrmation is\nwarranted.\nITC exhibits histological and immunophenotypic re-\nsemblances to eutopic thymic carcinoma. The tumour cells\ngenerally grow in a solid or nested pattern, identical to\nsquamous-cell carcinoma arising in the thymus.

Similar to thymomas and\nthymic carcinoma, on comparative genomic hybridisation\nITC is characterised by chromosomal imbalances such as\ngains on chromosomal arm 1q and losses on 6p, 6q and\n16q.100 The most frequently altered gene is the telomerase\nreverse transcriptase promoter mutation C228T, identiﬁed\nin 22% of cases.101 EGFR mutations have been docu-\nmented102 but their prevalence cannot be estimated due to\nthe limited number of cases analysed.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 ITC should be suspected in the presence of a cold nodule\nin the lower lobes of the thyroid gland with a cytological\ndiagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma [V, A].\n\u0003 Positive IHC for CD5, CD117 and p63 may allow for a pre-\noperative diagnosis [V, B].\n\u0003 Histological features that allow for a post-operative diag-\nnosis of ITC are lymphoid stroma, squamous-cell differen-\ntiation, infrequent mitoses and rare necrosis, positive IHC\nfor CD5, CD117 and p63, negative IHC for thyroglobulin,\nTTF-1 and calcitonin, and Ki-67 <20% [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nDisease stage is the main prognostic factor. Application of\nthe eighth edition of the UICC staging classiﬁcation25 for\nthyroid tumours is recommended, even if not speciﬁc for\nITC (see Supplementary Table S12, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Neck US, CT of the\nneck, thorax and abdomen, and neck MRI can be used for\nstaging. On CT, ITC appears as a well-deﬁned soft tissue\ndensity without calciﬁcation, whereas on MRI, it appears as\nan isointense and hyperintense mass on T1/T2-weighted\nimages.103 Similar to thymoma, ITC can show intense up-\ntake on FDGePETeCT; however, data on the use of FDGe\nPETeCT in patients with ITC are very limited.104\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Accurate assessment of local extension with US or MRI is\ncrucial for planning appropriate surgical intervention\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 CT of the chest and abdomen should be carried out to\nrule out the rare possibility of distant synchronous metas-\ntasis [V, A]. Complementary FDGePETeCT may be useful\nin some cases [V, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nSurgery is the treatment of choice (Figure 7). A pooled\nanalysis of published cases99 showed that thyroidectomy\n(total, subtotal or near total) was the most frequent surgical\nprocedure. Due to frequent nodal involvement at diagnosis,\nneck lymph node dissection [i.e. modiﬁed radical neck\ndissection (levels I-V), selective neck dissection of central\ncompartment (level VI) or lateral selective neck dissection\n(levels II-IV)] was carried out in >55% of cases. Among\npatients with a small ITC, 40% underwent thyroid lobec-\ntomy without lymph node dissection. RT was used in only\ntwo cases of locally advanced ITC not amenable to surgery\nwith radical intent.\nThe prognosis for patients with local or locoregional\ndisease is very good. In the pooled analysis,99 estimated\nmedian disease-free survival was 144 months (range 91-197\nmonths), median OS was not reached and w85% of\nFigure 7.

Based on these data,\nsurgery is recommended as the ﬁrst-line therapeutic option\nin patients with ITC with locoregional disease. The type of\nsurgery (i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be plan-\nned according to the available guideline for thyroid can-\ncers,28 using conservative surgical treatment whenever\npossible. Adjuvant RT does not improve prognosis and can\nbe avoided in most patients, although it may be discussed\nfor more advanced or aggressive cases. There is no role for\nadjuvant ChT. Patients with locoregional disease not\namenable to surgery with radical intent could be offered RT\nor chemoradiotherapy (CRT).\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Surgery is the mainstay of therapy. The type of surgery\n(i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be planned ac-\ncording to the available guidelines for thyroid cancers\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 Due to the indolent course of the disease and its good\nprognosis, conservative surgical treatment is preferred\nwhenever possible [V, B].\n\u0003 Neck dissection should be carried out according to guide-\nlines for thyroid cancers [V, A].\n\u0003 RT or CRT are reasonable options in case of locally\nadvanced disease not suitable for radical surgery [V, B].\n\u0003 If possible, adjuvant RT should be avoided due to the\nindolent disease course of ITC [IV, D]. It is an option in\nselected cases after careful multidisciplinary discussion\n[IV, B].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nAmong 120 patients with ITC who underwent primary\ntumour resection, 29 (24%) experienced recurrence at a\nmedian of 19 months (range 13-25 months).99 The recur-\nrence was locoregional in 21 patients (72%), and was\ntreated surgically in 90% and using RT in 42% of cases, with\nexcellent prognosis. A minority (w10%) of patients devel-\noped distant metastases; ﬁve patients (4%) had metastases\nat diagnosis and eight (6%) developed metachronous\ndistant metastases. The most common metastatic site was\nthe lung. Data on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in\npatients with metastatic ITC are limited. Similar to the\nrecommendations for locally advanced or metastatic thy-\nmoma or thymic carcinoma,28 cisplatin-containing regimens\nhave been used in most ITC cases, with a reported objective\nremission rate of 58%.99 Immunotherapy with the immune\ncheckpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab was used in one case,\nresulting in long-lasting disease control. Based on this single\nexperience, it is not possible to recommend immuno-\ntherapy for the treatment of metastatic ITC.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In case of local recurrence, salvage surgery is recommen-\nded [IV, A] and adjuvant RT may be discussed by an MTB\nfor patients who have not received prior RT [V, B].\n\u0003 In case of metastatic disease, cisplatin-based combination\nChT regimens with either doxorubicin and cyclophospha-\nmide or etoposide are the recommended options [V, B].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up is aimed at identifying locoregional recurrences\nand, more rarely, distant recurrences, usually within the ﬁrst\n5 years after initial treatment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In localised disease, neck US and CT scan of the neck and\nthorax are recommended 6-12 months after initial treat-\nment and then annually up to 5 years [V, C].\n\u0003 In metastatic disease, follow-up by CT and/or MRI (in case\nof liver, bone or brain metastases) every 3-6 months is rec-\nommended, depending on the tumour growth rate [V, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG was developed in accordance with the ESMO\nstandard\noperating\nprocedures\nfor\nCPG\ndevelopment\n(https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-\nMethodology).

Die Laborwerte bestätigen eine signifikante Hyperkalzämie (Calcium 4.8 mmol/L, referenzwert 2.2-2.6 mmol/L) und eine erhöhte Parathormon (PTH)-Konzentration (180 pg/mL, referenzwert 15-65 pg/mL). Die erhöhte PTH-Konzentration in Gegenwart von Hyperkalzämie ist charakteristisch für einen primären Hyperparathyreoidismus (PHPT). Die Bildgebung (Ultraschall, Sestamibi-Szintigraphie) zeigt eine einzelne, vergrößerte Parathyreoidea-Drüse, was auf ein Adenom hindeutet. Die Patientin ist 65 Jahre alt und erfüllt die Kriterien für eine chirurgische Intervention bei PHPT gemäß den ESMO-Leitlinien (Calcium >1 mg/dL über dem oberen Grenzwert, Symptome, Alter <50 Jahre, Niereninsuffizienz, Knochenverlust). Die Patientin ist symptomatisch und hat eine signifikante Hyperkalzämie, was eine Operation rechtfertigt. Es gibt keine Hinweise auf eine maligne Hyperkalzämie (PTHrp-Wert ist nicht erhöht, keine Anamnese von Malignomen). Die Patientin hat keine Kontraindikationen für eine Operation.\n</beurteilung>\n\n<therapieempfehlung>\nDie primäre Therapieempfehlung für diese Patientin ist die parathyreoidektomie (Entfernung des Adenoms). Die Operation sollte von einem erfahrenen Chirurgen durchgeführt werden, der mit parathyreoiden Operationen vertraut ist. Vor der Operation sollte die Patientin hydriert werden, um die Hyperkalzämie zu senken und das Risiko von Komplikationen zu minimieren. Nach der Operation sollte die Patientin auf Hypokalzämie überwacht werden, da die PTH-Spiegel plötzlich sinken können. Die Patientin sollte über die Notwendigkeit einer Operation und die potenziellen Risiken und Vorteile informiert werden.\n</therapieempfehlung>\n\n<begründung>\nDie parathyreoidektomie ist die einzige kurative Behandlung für den primären Hyperparathyreoidismus, der durch ein Adenom verursacht wird. Die Operation führt in der Regel zu einer Normalisierung der Calcium- und PTH-Spiegel und zur Linderung der Symptome. Die ESMO-Leitlinien empfehlen die parathyreoidektomie als Standardbehandlung für symptomatische Patienten mit PHPT und für asymptomatische Patienten, die bestimmte Kriterien erfüllen (z. B. Calcium >1 mg/dL über dem oberen Grenzwert, Alter <50 Jahre, Niereninsuffizienz, Knochenverlust). Diese Patientin ist symptomatisch und hat eine signifikante Hyperkalzämie, was die Notwendigkeit einer Operation unterstreicht. Die Bildgebung hat ein einzelnes Adenom lokalisiert, was die chirurgische Behandlung erleichtert. Die Operation ist in der Regel sicher und effektiv, mit einer hohen Erfolgsrate. Die Patientin hat keine Kontraindikationen für eine Operation. Die konservative Behandlung (z. B. Hydratation, Bisphosphonate) ist nur eine temporäre Maßnahme zur Kontrolle der Hyperkalzämie und keine definitive Behandlung des PHPT.\n</begründung>\n```",

Both malignancies are rare. ACC has an estimated\nincidence of w0.5-2 new cases per million people per year.1,2\nPhaeochromocytomas are catecholamine-producing neuro-\nendocrine tumours arising from chromafﬁn cells of the\nadrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia. The latter are\nusually called paraganglioma, leading to the combined term\nphaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs). The\ndetected incidence of PPGLs is commonly reported at 2-8 per\nmillion per year3 (supplementary information, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).\nAll patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL\nshould be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team\nmeeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis (ideally\nbefore surgery) and in case of progressive disease.\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nEvery patient with (suspected) ACC or PPGL should undergo\ncareful clinical assessment, including case history, clinical\nexamination for symptoms and signs of adrenal hormone\nexcess. For more details on this topic, we refer to more\ncomprehensive guidelines and reviews.3-8\nHormonal evaluation\nThe aims of hormonal evaluation are multiple: (i) hormone\nassays provide orientation to the nature of the adrenal\nmass and can be useful to assess presence of malignancy;\n(ii) a phaeochromocytoma should always be ruled out,\nbecause these tumours can induce life-threatening crises,\nrequiring speciﬁc management before any intervention; (iii)\nmassive adrenocortical steroid excess can impact short-\nterm survival and quality of life (QoL), requiring speciﬁc\ntreatments to block impacts of hormonal excess; (iv)\nabnormal hormone secretions may serve as biological\nmarkers for the follow-up of patients; (v) in case of large\nbilateral adrenal masses, a systematic assessment of adre-\nnal function is recommended to rule out adrenal insufﬁ-\nciency. Precise hormone assays have been detailed in recent\nguideline statements,4,5,9,10 and are summarised in Table 1.\nFor all adrenal masses, the diagnosis of phaeochro-\nmocytoma\nshould\nbe\nsystematically\nassessed\nby\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: June 2020.

For differential diag-\nnosis of an adrenal mass, computed tomography (CT) and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both effective [IV, A].\nAlthough these methods cannot determine the exact entity\nof the mass, both are able to correctly diagnose a subset of\nbenign tumoursdat least when carried out according to\nstate-of-the-art criteria. The single best criterion to diagnose\na benign tumour (e.g. adenoma) remains Hounsﬁeld units\n\u000210 in an unenhanced CT.17 However, other imaging\ncriteria, such as rapid washout in 10- or 15-min delayed\ncontrast-enhanced CT, signal intensity loss using opposed-\nphase MRI, and low 2-ﬂuorine-18 [18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-\nglucose (FDG) uptake in [18F]FDG-positron electron to-\nmography (PET)/CT are also suggestive of a benign tumour.\nMost ACCs show an inhomogeneous appearance in CT or\nMRI with irregular margins and irregular enhancement of\nsolid components after intravenous injection of contrasted\nagent. Detection of local invasion or tumour extension into\nthe inferior vena cava, as well as lymph node or other\nmetastasesdincluding lung and liverdis mandatory before\nplanning any surgery. Therefore, cross-sectional imaging\nof the chest, abdomen and pelvis is required preoperatively\n[V, A].\nFor PPGLs, conventional radiological imaging can be\nimportant to determine the presence of metastases. How-\never, neither CT nor MRI can be used to determine whether\nPPGLs are benign or malignant. Malignancy can only be\ndetermined from the presence of metastatic lesions at sites\nwhere chromafﬁn cells are normally absent. Without such\nevidence, all PPGLs should be considered potentially ma-\nlignant, with risk dependent on several factors as outlined\nbelow.\nThere are a number of functional imaging modalities\navailable for patients with PPGLs (supplementary File,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). The indication is twofold: (i) best tumour staging in\npatients with suspected metastases (e.g. by conventional\nimaging) or with presumably high risk for metastases; (ii) to\nevaluate the option of a radionuclide-based therapy in pa-\ntients with nonresectable PPGL. For assessments of meta-\nstatic risk for the ﬁrst indication the authors suggest the\npresence of one or more of the following criteria:\n\u0003 tumour size \u00045 cm;\n\u0003 any extra-adrenal paraganglioma;\n\u0003 known succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur\nsubunit B (SDHB) germline mutation; or\n\u0003 plasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above\nthe upper cut-offs of reference intervals.\nFor imaging-based diagnosis of metastatic PPGLs, it is\nimportant to avoid confusing metastases with multiple\nprimary tumours that often occur in patients with heredi-\ntary PPGL syndromes. Additionally, local recurrences should\nnot be misdiagnosed as metastases.\nPathology\nBiopsy of adrenal tumours is usually contraindicated\nbecause of the risk of tumour spillage, poor diagnostic po-\nwer to discriminate benign from malignant adrenocortical\ntumours and risk of hypertensive crises in phaeochromo-\ncytoma. However, a biopsy might be indicated in an adrenal\nmass without any hormone excess in patients with a history\nof extra-adrenal cancers to exclude or prove an adrenal\nmetastasis of an extra-adrenal malignancy, and in patients\nin whom tumour sequencing is desired.\nThe pathological differential diagnosis of adrenal neo-\nplasias in both biopsied and resected specimens is primarily\nbased on morphological features requiring an experienced\npathologist [IV, A]. Preferably, a panel of immunohisto-\nchemical markers should be applied to aid diagnosis; for\nexample, steroidogenesis factor 1 (SF1) or, alternatively,\ninhibin-alpha, calretinin and melan-A for identiﬁcation of\nadrenocortical tumours and chromogranin A for identiﬁca-\ntion of PPGL [IV, A]. Staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and\nsynaptophysin may also be helpful to highlight PPGL, but\npositive results for synaptophysin are also possible in\nadrenocortical tumours. The differential diagnosis between\nACC and adenoma may be challenging as no single marker\nindicates malignancy. The most widely used diagnostic score\nhas been introduced by Weiss18,19 and includes nine pa-\nrameters (supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099) [IV, A]. A score of \u00043\nsuggests malignancy. In addition, the Ki-67 labelling index,\nas a marker of proliferative activity, may be useful and is\nvery\nhelpful\nfor\nprognostic\npurposes\n(supplementary\nTables S2 and S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nannonc.2020.08.2099).\nFor phaeochromocytomas, the situation is similarly\ndemanding. Tumour size, SDHB mutation status, extra-\nadrenal location and plasma methoxytyramine may all be\nused to indicate riskof metastasis. However,there is no single\nhistological or immunohistochemical parameter that can\npredict the clinical behaviour of PPGL. Nevertheless, several\nhistological scoring systems have been developed.20-23 All\nthese scores have value but none of them has reached\ngeneral acceptance. Therefore, according to the current\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcation, all PPGLs\nshould be considered to have some malignant potential.24 A\ndeﬁnitive diagnosis of malignancy can only be made by the\npresence of metastases at sites where chromafﬁn tissue is\nnormally absent (e.g. liver, bone, lungs or lymph nodes),\nassessed by pathology or imaging, in particular functional\nimaging.\nM.

The\ngene encoding subunit B of the SDHB complex is by far the\nmost important molecular contributor to malignant PPGL,\nwith at least 40% of all cases of metastatic PPGLs carrying\nmutations of this gene.25 Inactivation of SDHB reduces\nfunction of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, leading\nto activation of the hypoxia-inducible pathway and a\npseudohypoxic state characterised by increased angiogen-\nesis, growth and expression of mitogenic factors,26 but also\nto DNA hypermethylation, which is believed to provide a\nfurther drive to metastatic progression.27\nAt least 35% of PPGLs result from germline mutations of\nover 18 tumour-susceptibility genes identiﬁed to date,28-33\nwith those resulting in stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible fac-\ntors 1a and 2a (HIF1a and HIF2a) carrying a higher risk of\nmetastatic disease than those due to other mutations\n(supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). Risk is particularly high, reach-\ning 70% in patients with PPGL due to mutations in the SDHB\ngene.34 The vast majority of all metastatic PPGLs, including\ndisease due to SDHB mutations, develop from noradrenergic\nor dopaminergic PPGLs with poorly developed secretory\npathways. Nevertheless, a small minority of about 10% of\nmetastatic PPGLs develop from adrenal adrenergic tumours\nthat are characterised by production of epinephrine, as man-\nifested by increased plasma or urinary metanephrine.35\nOf note, metastatic disease may only become apparent\nmany years after the primary tumour is resected. This and\nlater development in some patients of locally recurrent\ndisease underscore the importance of recommendations for\nfollow-up of all patients with previously resected PPGLs.9\nRecommendations\n\u0003 All patients with an adrenal tumour suspected to be an\nACC or a phaeochromocytoma should undergo careful\nclinical assessment for signs of adrenal hormone excess.\n\u0003 All patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL\nshould be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team\nmeeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis and in\ncase of progressive disease.\n\u0003 All patients with suspected ACC require a comprehensive\nendocrinework-uptoidentifypotentialautonomousexcess\nTable 1.

Recent data suggest\nthat lymph node involvement correlates with stage IV\nrather than stage III behaviour.37\nOverall, the prognosis of ACC is limited. However, pro-\nspective data suggest that in patients with complete\nresection of a localised stage II tumour 5-year overall sur-\nvival (OS) can be as high as 90%.38 In metastatic ACC, me-\ndian survival is about 15 months. However, even in this\ngroup, there is a subgroup of patients with long-term\nsurvival.36,37\nIt is well established that disease stage and margin-free\nresection are currently the most important prognostic fac-\ntors in ACC. For the European Society of Endocrinology\n(ESE)eENSAT guidelines, a comprehensive literature search\nfor prognostic factors has been carried out and only the\nproliferation marker Ki-67 and glucocorticoid excess showed\na robust association with prognosis [IV, A] (supplementary\nTable S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.\n08.2099).4,39 Many other (molecular) markers for aggres-\nsiveness and survival have been recently proposed, but their\nclinical use requires validation.\nPPGL\nIn 2017,the WHO proposed a tumourstaging system for PPGL\n(supplementary Table S6, available at https://doi.org/10.1\n016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).24 Although this staging classi-\nﬁcation remains to be validated, the authors recommend\nusing this system to harmonise disease classiﬁcation.\nDespite limitations, the authors suggest assessing the risk\nof metastatic disease in an individualised manner, taking into\naccount previous history of disease and the presence or\nabsence of a germline mutation of a tumour-susceptibility\ngene (supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/\n10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). For ﬁrst-time patients\nwithout any history of disease or known mutation, size and\nlocation of the primary tumour, and when available, any el-\nevations of plasma methoxytyramine during biochemical\ntesting seem important to consider when evaluating risk\nfor malignancy. As described above, the authors suggest\nestablishing ‘high risk of metastases’ when any patient pre-\nsents with one or more of the following criteria: (i) adrenal\nphaeochromocytoma \u00045 cm; (ii) an extra-adrenal para-\nganglioma; (iii) a known SDHB germline mutation; or (iv)\nplasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above the\nupper limit of reference intervals. In these patients, whole-\nbody functional imaging may be justiﬁed, particularly for\ncases involving more than one of those four criteria.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The ENSAT TNM system should be used for initial staging\nof ACC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Genetic counselling should be offered to all patients with\nPPGL.\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nSurgery\nSurgery is essential for treatment of both ACC and phaeo-\nchromocytoma. Adrenal surgery should be carried out only\nby surgeons with appropriate expertise and experience. The\nlack of consensus on what is deﬁned as appropriate expe-\nrience and the absence of evidence that a speciﬁc experi-\nence in adrenal surgery translates into improved outcomes\nlimit any recommendations concerning this issue.40-42 The\nrecent ESEeENSAT guidelines on ACC suggest a minimal\nannual workload of six adrenalectomies per year, but with\na preference for >20 surgeries per year. In addition to\nexpertise in adrenal surgery, sufﬁcient experience in onco-\nlogical surgery is essential [V, B].4 For best clinical outcome,\nthe entire operative team (including anaesthesiologists)\nshould be well-trained in adrenal surgery.\nM.

Therefore, a\nmargin-free complete resection (R0 resection) is key to\nachieving long-term survival [V, A].2,44 In order to obtain an\nR0 resection of a locally advanced ACC, it may be necessary\nto resect (parts of) adjacent organs such as the wall of the\nvena cava, liver, spleen, colon, pancreas and/or stomach [V,\nB]. Complete en bloc resection of the tumoural mass,\nincluding periadrenal fat and adjacent organs if necessary, is\nmandatory to avoid tumour rupture or spillage that por-\ntends an adverse outcome.45 Locoregional lymphadenec-\ntomy improves tumour staging and seems to lead to a\nfavourable oncological outcome.46\nRoutine lymphadenectomy should include at least the\nperiadrenal and hilar nodes [IV, A], although the best extent\nFigure 2.

One study with 207 patients\n(including 88 with mitotane) found that adjuvant mitotane\nwas associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS)50;\nhowever, the mitotane group was likely selected for a higher\nrisk of recurrence, a bias that cannot be fully adjusted for in\nmultivariate analysis.\nProbably, the best evidence supporting adjuvant mitotane\nuse comes from a multicentre, case-control study that cir-\ncumvented confounders by comparing patient groups treated\nat centres adopting two different treatment strategies. The\nstudy involved 177 patients, of whom 47 were followed in\nItalian reference centres that systematically adopted adjuvant\nmitotane to all radically operated ACC. Fifty-ﬁve Italian pa-\ntients and 75 German patients were followed in institutions\nnot administering adjuvant mitotane therapy.51 The outcome\nof this cohort has been recently updated, conﬁrming that the\nmitotane-treated patients have prolonged RFS compared with\npatients left untreated after surgery.52\nTwo recent meta-analyses have reported that adjuvant\nmitotane treatment reduces the risk of recurrence and\ndeath.4,53 In both analyses, the beneﬁt associated with mito-\ntane was signiﬁcant forOS, whereas itwas signiﬁcant forRFS in\nonly one study.53 Another retrospective multicentre study\ndemonstrated that blood mitotane concentrations \u000414 mg/l\nwere associated with a prolonged RFS in patients treated with\nadjuvant mitotane following macroscopically radical surgery.54\nOn these bases, the recent ESEeENSAT guidelines on the\nmanagement of ACC suggest that patients at high risk of\nrecurrence (stage III, or R1-RX resection, and/or Ki-67 index\n>10%) should be offered adjuvant mitotane [IV, B].4 By\ncontrast, adjuvant therapy has to be discussed on an individual\nbasis in patients fulﬁlling all the following criteria: stage I or II\ndisease, histologicallyproven R0 resection and Ki-67expressed\nin \u000210% of neoplastic cells, which deﬁne the category of low\nrisk of recurrence [V, B] (Figure 1).4 For these patients, the\nresults of the still ongoing randomised ADIUVO trial55 testing\nthe efﬁcacy of adjuvant mitotane therapy are awaited.\nThere are no data regarding the optimal duration of\nadjuvant mitotane; however, the authors recommend that\nadjuvant mitotane should be administered for at least 2\nyears [V, B], because the greatest frequency of disease\nrecurrence is expected within this time frame. However, it is\nnot advised to continue adjuvant mitotane beyond 5 years,\ndue to the low number of ACC recurrences occurring after\nthis time [V, B].4\nAdjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is able to reduce the risk of\nlocal recurrence but does not prevent distant recurrences\nand, as a consequence, does not impact OS.4 Therefore, it is\nreasonable to associate mitotane with RT in selected pa-\ntients with stage III ACC and/or R1 or RX resection, although\nthe combination carries increased toxicity [IV, B].4\nThe adjuvant use of cytotoxic drugs is not well established\nin ACC. Nevertheless, some centres are beginning to apply\ncytotoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin plus etoposide) in selected\npatients with very high riskof recurrence and this approach is\nbeing investigated in a randomised trial (NCT03583710).\nSpecial considerations on mitotane. Mitotane is a difﬁcult\ndrug to manage, with a long half-life, dose-limiting toxicity\nand a narrow therapeutic window.

AsinACC,thesurgicalexcisionofthetumouristheﬁrst-\nline treatment of PPGLs (Figure 2). However, laparoscopic/\nminimal invasive surgery is commonly the technique of ﬁrst\nchoice for resection adrenal and extra-adrenal PPGLs [V, A],\nbecause local invasion is rare and the likelihood of rupture of\nthe capsule seems less common than in ACC. It is obvious,\nhowever,that the resection should be complete and if there is\nany risk that this cannot be achieved by laparoscopic surgery,\nan open approach should be carried out. In patients with\nPPGL, exposure to high levels of circulating catecholamines\nduring surgery could cause hypertensive crises and arrhyth-\nmias. Therefore, all patients with PPGL should receive pre-\noperative preparation at least 10-14 days before surgery [V,\nA].5 Blood pressure targets for the treatment are <130/80\nmmHg in the supine position, and a systolic blood pressure\npreferably >90 mmHg in the upright position. The noncom-\npetitive a-adrenoreceptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, is\ntraditionally the most frequently used adrenergic blocking\nagent. A standard starting dose is 10 mg twice daily with ad-\njustments over the following days. Alternatively, doxazosin, a\ncompetitive and selective a1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, can\nbe similarly effective. If the target blood pressure is not\nreached, calcium antagonists (slow-release nifedipine) or\nmetyrosine may be used. Blockade of b-adrenergic receptors\nis indicated in patients developing tachyarrhythmias but\nshould never be started before blockade of a-receptors.\nGiven the likelihood of rapid intraoperative haemody-\nnamic lability, continuous monitoring of arterial and central\nvenous pressures is essential throughout surgery. Although\ntoday’s volatile anaesthetics are not inductive of hyperten-\nsive crisis, such crises can be induced by other manipulations\nduring surgical procedure (e.g. intubation, insufﬂation of\nperitoneum, direct palpation of the PPGL) or administration\nof certain drugs (e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines).56 Therefore,\nit is strongly recommended that anaesthesia is supervised by\nan experienced anaesthesiologist alert to the diagnosis of a\ncatecholamine-producing tumour. Hypertension during sur-\ngery may be treated with magnesium sulfate, intravenous a-\nadrenoreceptor antagonists (e.g. phentolamine), calcium\nantagonists and/or nitroprusside or nitroglycerine. Tachy-\ncardia can be treated with intravenous b-adrenergic receptor\nblockers (e.g. esmolol). Postoperative hypotension should be\nprevented by saline infusion the day before surgery. If this\nadverse event occurs, it should be treated aggressively. In\ngeneral, sufﬁcient rehydration and treatment of constipation\nare important parts of the preoperative management. Post-\noperative care should also focus on glucose levels because\nhypoglycaemia may occur after reduction of catecholamine\nlevels. Cytoreductive debulking surgery (R2) in malignant\nphaeochromocytoma may improve QoL and survival by\nreducing tumour burden and controlling hormonal hyperse-\ncretion [V, B].3\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

In one series of 171\npatients followed up after surgical resection, 29 patients\n(17%) had recurrent or new tumours which were malignant\nin 15 cases (9%).6\nRecommendations\nACC\n\u0003 Complete en bloc resection of all adrenal tumours sus-\npected to be ACC by a surgeon experienced in adrenal\nand oncological surgery is the mainstay of a potentially\ncurative approach. Open surgery is the standard treat-\nment but in tumours <6 cm without evidence of local\ninvasion, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is reasonable, if\nthe surgeon has sufﬁcient experience.\n\u0003 Additionally,alocoregionallymphadenectomyissuggested.\n\u0003 Perioperative hydrocortisone replacement is required in\nall patients with autonomous cortisol secretion [V, A].\n\u0003 Adjuvant mitotane is recommended in patients at high\nrisk of recurrence (stage III, or R1-RX resection, and/or\nKi-67 index >10%) [IV, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant therapy has to be discussed on an individual\nbasis in patients with low risk of recurrence (stage I/II,\nR0 resection and Ki-67 index \u000210%) [V, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant RT is only suggested on an individualised basis\n(in addition to mitotane) in patients with R1 or RX resec-\ntion or in stage III [IV, B].\n\u0003 After complete resection, radiological imaging every 3\nmonths for 2 years, then every 3-6 months for at least\nanother 3 years is recommended [V, B].\nPPGL\n\u0003 Most PPGLs can be safely removed laparoscopically by\nan experienced surgeon [V, A].\n\u0003 Preoperatively, patients should be treated for 10-14 days\nwith an alpha blocker (e.g. phenoxybenzamine) [V, A].\n\u0003 Meticulous perioperative management of hormonal,\nglucose, electrolytes, cardiac and ﬂuid/blood pressure\nabnormalities is a critical component of patient care.\n\u0003 Patients with resected PPGL should be followed at regu-\nlar intervals for at least 10 years (lifelong for patients\nwith a germline mutation). Most authors recommend\nonly annual measurement of metanephrines in most pa-\ntients, but some authors carry out additionally regular\nimaging.\nMANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE\nACC\nPrognosis of advanced ACC patients is limited, the 5-year OS\nbeing <15%. However, several studies have highlighted\nconsiderable heterogeneity in survival. Indeed, prolonged\nsurvival has been reported especially in patients with\nresectable oligometastatic disease, with long intervals be-\ntween recurrences.57,58\nIn general, ﬁrst-line therapy in patients with advanced/\nmetastatic disease is mitotane alone or mitotane plus\nchemotherapy (ChT). Surgery and locoregional therapies\nshould be adopted in addition to systemic therapy in\nselected patient populations (Figure 3). The goal of the\ntherapy is to control tumour growth, hypersecretion-related\nsymptoms and prolong survival.\nA study of the ENSAT network recently identiﬁed the\nprognostic factors in patients with advanced disease.\nAccordingly the stage, as redeﬁned by a modiﬁed ENSAT\n(mENSAT) classiﬁcation,37 which takes into account the\nnumber of tumoural organs, has a major prognostic role\ntogether with the following four parameters grouped under\nthe label GRAS: (i) tumour Grade, (ii) Resection status of the\nprimary tumour, (iii) Age, and (iv) tumour-related or\nhormone-related Symptoms. Based on these results, a risk\nstratiﬁcation was introduced.59 Although this new risk\nclassiﬁcation looks interesting, it needs conﬁrmation in\nother studies before being fully applicable in clinics.\nMitotane\nmonotherapy.\nMitotane\nis\nthe\nonly\ndrug\napproved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in\nlocally\nadvanced\ninoperable\nand\nmetastatic\npatients\n(supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099);\nnevertheless,\nrandomised\ncontrolled prospective trials are lacking. Response rates in\nmetastatic ACC vary between 13% and 35% but much of\nthese data are derived from retrospective series, including\nstudies in 1960s with overall variability in response criteria.4\nFor details on mitotane management, see above and\nsupplementary Table S7, available at https://doi.org/10.10\n16/j.annonc.2020.08.2099. Owing to the latency of mito-\ntane to attain the therapeutic range, mitotane mono-\ntherapy is indicated in the management of patients with a\nlow tumour burden and/or more indolent disease (i.e. pa-\ntients with favourable prognostic parameters). At disease\nprogression, ChT with etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin\n(EDP) should be added to mitotane monotherapy [I, A].\nCytotoxic ChT. The combination of EDP and mitotane (EDP-M)\nis recommended in ﬁrst-line settings based on the FIRM-ACT\ntrial results [I, A] (supplementary Table S8, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099 and Figure 3).\nIn the phase III randomised trial including 304 patients,\nprogression-free survival (PFS) was clearly superior in patients\ntreated with EDP-M compared with patients treated with\nstreptozocin plusmitotane[5.0versus2.1months,hazardratio\n(HR) 0.55, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.43-0.69, P < 0.001].60\nHowever, the difference in OS was not signiﬁcant (14.8 versus\n12.0months, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02,P ¼ 0.07), presumably\ndue to the crossover and presence of mitotane in both arms.\nInterestingly, a survival advantage of the EDP-M arm was\nobserved in patients, who could not receive the second-line\ntherapy. In patients unsuitable for EDP-M, mitotane in com-\nbination with etoposide and cisplatin [V, B],61 or mitotane plus\ncisplatin, is an option [V, B].62\nM. Fassnacht et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 11\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099\n1485\n\n---\nIn second-line settings, after failure of EDP-M, the treat-\nment options are limited63 and enrolment of patients into\nclinical trials should be considered ﬁrst. Most patients with\nadvanced ACC remain in good clinical condition but urgently\nseek therapy. In the absence of trials, possible options are the\nassociation of gemcitabine plus capecitabine64,65 or strepto-\nzocin (supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/1\n0.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).60 With both treatments, the\nmedian PFS is short, between 2 and 4 months. Mitotane\ntherapy is sometimes continued in association with second-\nline therapies. However, this must be discussed with the\npatient according to tolerance to the drug and its effect on\nhormonal secretion. The optimal timing to discontinue\nmitotane is debated and could be discussed with the patient\nindividually in cases of progressive disease despite ‘thera-\npeutic’ drug levels or highest tolerated doses assessed at two\ndistinct evaluations.\nSurgery and local therapies. Surgery, including surgery of\nthe primary tumour, may be recommended in all patients\nwith oligometastatic ACC if a complete resection of all\ntumoural lesions is feasible [V, B].4 Additionally, patients\nwith an indolent disease course or under therapeutic\ncontrol might be eligible for surgery. It is also worthwhile\nto consider surgery or other local therapies in all patients\nin whom systemic therapy led to an objective response\nor long-term stable disease [V, B].66,67 A cytoreductive\nresection may also be indicated in rare cases of severe\nsymptomatic hormone excess, after attempts to control\nthe symptoms with a combination of fast-acting anti-\nsecretory agents (i.e. metyrapone) and mitotane68 and\nlocal therapies [V, B]. In these patients, postoperative\nmitotane is clearly advised [V, A]. Local therapies [e.g. RT,\nchemoembolisation,\nradiofrequency\nablation\n(RFA)]\nshould also be discussed in all patients with advanced\noligometastatic ACC [V, B].4\nIn case of a recurrence following ACC surgery, two critical\nquestions must be addressed: (i) What is the time interval\nsince the resection? and (ii) Did recurrence occur during\nongoing mitotane therapy (with effective blood levels)? If the\ndisease-free interval is at least 12 months and another\ncomplete R0 resection/ablation seems feasible, then surgery\nor, alternatively, other local therapies are clearly recom-\nmended [IV, A].69,70 However, if this time interval is <6\nmonths orifcomplete resection/ablation is not feasible,then,\nthe EDP-M provides the treatment of choice, especially if the\nrecurrence occurred during ongoing mitotane treatment at\ntherapeutic levels [IV, A].\nMolecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Several\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been investigated as\nsecond-line approaches in small phase II trials involving\nadvanced ACC (for review, see4,71). Results, however, have\nfailed to show signiﬁcant therapeutic efﬁcacy. In addition,\nthe insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor\nlinsitinib was tested in a multicentre placebo-controlled\nphase III trial (GALACTIC trial) and failed to improve\neither PFS or OS of advanced ACC patients who had already\nreceived systemic antineoplastic therapies.72\nThe results of the ﬁrst (small) trials with immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors in ACC were heterogeneous, with\nmedian PFS times of 1.8, 2.1, 2.6 and 6.75 months,\nrespectively.73-76 However, in one study with 39 patients,\ndisease control rate was 52% and median OS reached\nalmost 25 months, clearly suggesting that a least a subset of\npatients beneﬁts from this therapeutic approach.76\nManagement of hormone excess. In addition to sequelae\nof the malignant disease, patients with overt hyper-\ncortisolism suffer from immunosuppression, diabetes and\nmuscle weakness, which can signiﬁcantly impact QoL.\nSimilarly, severe androgen excess may dramatically impair\nwell-being in women. Therefore, medical therapy to control\nhormonal excess is recommended [V, A]. Mitotane is\nfrequently able to diminish steroid excess, but its efﬁcacy is\noften delayed by several weeks. In these circumstances,\nsteroidogenic enzyme inhibitors, such as metyrapone or\nketoconazole, can be useful [V, B]. Metyrapone is a well-\ntolerated drug and its metabolism and elimination are not\naltered by concomitant mitotane. Therefore, it can be safely\nadministered in association with mitotane and cytotoxic\nChT.68 Local therapies including liver embolisation may also\nbe discussed. All patients with clinically overt hormone\nexcess should be managed by physicians experienced with\nthese endocrine problems.\nPPGLs\nThe therapeutic strategy for metastatic PPGL primarily aims\nto control excessive catecholamine secretion and tumour\nburden, as there are no curative treatment options. Choices\nfor treatment include a watch-and-wait policy (including\nalpha blocker to control hypertension), locoregional thera-\npies,\nradiopharmaceutical\nagents,\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nmolecular-targeted therapies (Figure 4, supplementary\nTable S9, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2020.08.2099). Such choices should be discussed case by\ncase in a multidisciplinary specialised setting. In the absence\nof any published randomised trials and demonstrated\nimpact on survival, QoL for patients should always be\nconsidered in any justiﬁcation for a speciﬁc therapeutic\nintervention. Indeed, due to the indolent course of disease\nin some patients,77 an active surveillance policy may be\nindicated for those who are asymptomatic, have a low-to-\nintermediate tumour burden and absence of localised\ncomplications of any mass. In these patients, treatment-\nrelated adverse events may exceed any beneﬁt of therapy.\nSurgery. Although there is little possibility of a cure for\nmetastatic PPGLs, surgical resection of the primary tumour\nor metastatic lesions should be considered on a case-by-\ncase basis. Debulking surgery can improve symptoms and\npotentially prognosis by reducing secretion of catechol-\namines.78 Other local therapies are available for patients\nwith metastases, such as RT, RFA or chemoembolisation.\nLocal measures are also important to prevent bone-related\nevents.79 However, as with any invasive procedure, local\nablation may induce massive tumoural catecholamine\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Radionuclide therapy is an effective\ntreatment and [131I]MIBG is one of the most frequent ap-\nproaches with radionuclide doses ranging widely from 5.5\nto 38 GBq (150-1000 mCi). Approximately 50% of patients\nare eligible for [131I]MIBG therapy based on uptake from\ndiagnostic scans. Several studies have been published on\nthe efﬁcacy of [131I]MIBG treatment,3 mostly retrospective\nand only two prospective phase II trials.81,82 In both trials,\nobjective responses were observed in 23% of cases ac-\ncording to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours.\nLong-term survival of responders of over 6 years has been\nreported but progression at study entry was not a prereq-\nuisite for most studies. Objective responses were mainly\nobserved in patients with soft tissue metastases. Grade 3-4\ntoxicity was reported in 16%-83% of patients, mainly hae-\nmatological including myelodysplastic syndrome especially\nwith high activity doses.3,82 [131I]MIBG therapy could be\nconsidered as ﬁrst-line approach in patients displaying avid\nuptake of [123I]MIBG in all tumoural lesions who have\nunresectable, progressive PPGL or high tumour burden\n[III, A].\nAn alternative approach is a peptide receptor radioligand\ntherapy using somatostatin analogues labelled with iso-\ntopes delivering a cytotoxic radionuclide. More than 80% of\nPPGLs are detectable by somatostatin-based imaging.83 In\npatients with high uptake of PET tracers, such as gallium-68\n(68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogues (e.g. [68Ga]DOTA-\nTATE or DOTATOC or DOTANOC), treatment with yttrium-\n90-labelled [90Y]DOTATOC or lutetium-177-labelled [177Lu]\nDOTATATE could be similarly effective as MIBG-based\ntherapy, although the number of published studies/case\nseries is limited [V, B].84 Both radionuclide approaches can\nbe applied repeatedly (with a minimum time interval of 3-4\nmonths). However, toxicity frequently becomes a limiting\nfactor over time and beneﬁt should be re-evaluated after\nevery second therapy.\nSystemic ChT. Systemic ChT might be considered as a ﬁrst-\nline treatment in patients with PPGL who have no signiﬁ-\ncant uptake of radiotracers or that are also rapidly pro-\ngressing and associated with high tumour burden or are\nhighly symptomatic [IV, B]. ChT with cyclophosphamide- and\ndacarbazine-based regimens combined with vincristine (CVD)\nand/or doxorubicin (CVDD or CDD) are the most studied\nregimens.85 In the largest published study to date (n ¼ 52\npatients), 40% of patients treated with CVD, CDD or CVDD\nexperienced clinical beneﬁt, including reduction in tumour\nsize in 25% of cases.86 Based on retrospective data, temozo-\nlomide, an oral alternative to dacarbazine, seems to be as\neffective as the previous polyChT regimens.87 These studies\nsuggest that patients with SDHB mutations are especially\nsensitive to temozolomide due to the association with\nhypermethylation of the promoter for O6-methylguanine-\nDNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Furthermore, recent case\nreports provide limited evidence that metronomic temozo-\nlomide is also effective as a second-line therapy.88\nTargeted therapies. There is a rationale and some evidence\non the potential efﬁcacy of antiangiogenic drugs in malig-\nnant\nphaeochromocytomas,\nespecially\nthose\nbearing\nSDHB gene mutations.89 Sunitinib is a potent TKI, including\nvascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 1\nand 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)\nbeta, KIT, FLT3 and RET, and has been the most-studied\ntargeted therapy in PPGL. In addition to several impres-\nsive case reports involving sunitinib, there is one retro-\nspective series with 17 patients with progressive metastatic\nPPGL.90 Of 14 evaluable patients, three had a partial\nresponse (21%) and ﬁve had stable disease (36%). Median\nPFS was 4.1 months and OS 27 months. As hypertension is\na key feature of PPGL and a major adverse event of suni-\ntinib, special attention is required to deal with this issue.\nThere are currently several ongoing trials on sunitinib\nincluding a randomised, placebo-controlled trial testing\nsunitinib in patients with malignant PPGL, now closed for\nrecruitment (FIRST-MAPPP trial, NCT01371201).\nA phase II study with pazopanib involving seven patients\n(study closed because of poor accrual) reported one\nconﬁrmed partial response (17%, duration 2.4 years) and\nmedian PFS and OS of 6.5 and 14.8 months, respectively.91\nRecommendations\nACC\n\u0003 In most patients with metastatic ACC, ﬁrst-line therapy\nwith mitotane alone or mitotane plus ChT is recommen-\nded; EDP-M is the ﬁrst-line treatment of choice [I, A].\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. low tumour burden and/or\nmore\nindolent\ndisease),\nmitotane\nmonotherapy\nis\nreasonable.\n\u0003 Surgery and locoregional therapies should be adopted in\naddition\nto\nsystemic\ntherapy\nin\nselected\npatient\npopulations.\n\u0003 Surgery is the treatment of choice only if all tumoural le-\nsions can be removed [V, B].\n\u0003 Local therapies (e.g. RT, RFA, cryoablation, microwave\nablation, chemoembolisation) are of value for therapy\nin advanced ACC, and an individualised treatment\napproach is required [V, B].\nPPGL\n\u0003 Although there are no curative treatment options, treat-\nment choices include watch-and-wait, locoregional ther-\napies, radiopharmaceutical agents, systemic ChT and\nmolecular-targeted therapies.\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. with low tumour burden\nwithout relevant symptoms), a watch-and-wait policy\n(including alpha blocker to control hypertension) is\npreferred.\n\u0003 In all patients with metastatic PPGL (debulking) surgery\nshould be considered.\nM.

In these guidelines, we follow the recom-\nmendations provided recently by other groups.4,9 For locally\nadvanced or metastatic disease, OS and time-to-progression\nare the most important end points, response rate and\ntreatment toxicity providing secondary end points. Time-to-\nprogression, ORR and treatment toxicity guide clinical\ndecision making in individual patients; they should be\nevaluated at regular intervals during treatment using CT\nscans and/or MRI and laboratory results (supplementary\nFile, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). For patients opting for entirely palliative manage-\nment, no systematic imaging is advised. Information on\nlong-term implications, patient experience, psychological\nimplications and effect of rehabilitation is lacking for ACC\nand PPGL. At least, speciﬁc management of survivors should\nbe based on individual needs and preferences.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines have been produced by\nESMO in partnership with EURACAN, the European Refer-\nence Network for rare adult solid cancers.

They help health pro-\nfessionals weigh the beneﬁts and the risks of available diagnostic\nor therapeutic options. Randomised clinical trial (RCT) data on\nthe management of thyroid cancer (TC) are relatively scarce, and\nthe quality of available evidence is suboptimal. Retrospective\nanalyses of treatment efﬁcacy frequently show favourable out-\ncomes, but it is difﬁcult to discern the extent to which these\nresults are due to the natural history of the disease. The number\nof cases retrospectively analysed is not an index of the quality of\nthe data or the absence of biases. Consequently, large, well-\nplanned RCTs managed within a network of coordinated centres\nare urgently needed.\nThe main goals of any cancer treatment are to improve overall\nsurvival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Persistent disease in low-\nrisk TC patients is often associated with prolonged survival. The\nindolent behaviour of the tumours in these individuals—the vast\nmajority of the patients seen by clinicians—argues for the use of\nless aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches than those\nreserved for higher-risk patients. Therefore, clinical practice\nguidelines are also intended to provide oncologists with cost-\neffective strategies that will minimise the risks associated with\novertreatment.\nIncidence and epidemiology\nThe last three decades have witnessed steady, worldwide increases\nin the incidence of TC [1, 2]. Figures from the European Network\nof Cancer Registries show estimated incidence rates among\nfemales in 2012 that were approximately threefold higher than\nthose for males (9.3 and 3.1 cases per 100 000 person-years, re-\nspectively) [1]. Rates vary widely from country to country, with\nthe highest ﬁgures (per 100 000 person-years) reported in\nLithuania (15.5), Italy (13.5), Austria (12.4), Croatia (11.4) and\nLuxembourg (11.1). Estimated TC-related mortality rates, by\ncontrast, are low (0.7 and 0.5 cases per 100 000 person-years for\nwomen and men, respectively) with considerably less regional\nand temporal variation [3].\nThe rising incidence rates are almost entirely due to the\nincreased diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) and\npapillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) in particular. Incidence rates for\nfollicular (FTC), anaplastic (ATC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid\ncancers have remained relatively stable over the past 30 years. The\nexpanding use of imaging techniques, biopsy procedures [e.g.\nﬁne-needle aspiration (FNA)] and medical surveillance, along\nwith improved access to healthcare, has facilitated the detection\nof small, subclinical PTCs [4]. The resulting overdiagnosis has in-\nvariably been accompanied by overtreatment [5]. According to\nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force, the risks associ-\nated with TC screening in asymptomatic adults are likely to\nV\nC The Author(s) 2019.

Support is also growing for\nmore conservative, risk-tailored strategies for TC management\n(including watchful waiting) [7–10].\nDTC and poorly differentiated TC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nThe diagnostic work-up of DTCs (including poorly differentiated\nforms) comprises pre- and postoperative pathological and mo-\nlecular assessments. Preoperative FNA for cytology is not\nrequired for nodules measuring \u00021 cm. Decisions to aspirate\nlarger nodules should be guided by lesion size and sonographic\nappearance [8]. Cytology ﬁndings are classiﬁed into diagnostic\ncategories associated with different risks of malignancy [11].\nMost malignant thyroid tumours can be identiﬁed cytologically.\nNotable exceptions are FTCs and the newly deﬁned ‘non-invasive\nfollicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features’\n(NIFTP), which are usually classiﬁed as indeterminate in the vari-\nous thyroid cytology reporting schemes [12]. FNA-based diagno-\nsis of poorly differentiated carcinoma is also challenging unless\nthere is obviously increased mitotic activity and/or necrosis. FNA\ndiagnosis can be facilitated by assessment of malignancy markers\n(including proteins commonly overexpressed in tumours, e.g.\nHBME1 or galectin-3) and molecular alterations speciﬁcally asso-\nciated with malignancy (e.g. BRAF mutations, RET fusions, other\nnovel gene alterations). Speciﬁcally designed gene panels are re-\nportedly useful for identifying malignancy when cytology sam-\nples are morphologically indeterminate [13].\nResected DTCs are histologically classiﬁed according to the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) criteria (updated in 2017—\nTable 1). Based on clinical evidence of their low-grade behaviour\nduring long-term follow-up, encapsulated non-invasive follicular\nPTC variants are now referred to as NIFTPs. They account for up\nto 20% of cases in Europe [14]. Elimination of the term ‘carcin-\noma’ from the deﬁnition of this PTC variant underscores its ex-\ncellent prognosis: NIFTP is associated with no reports of cancer-\nrelated deaths and an estimated risk of recurrence of <1%. This\nnew entity shows partial overlap with the group of tumours\ndeﬁned in Europe as ‘well-differentiated tumours of uncertain\nmalignant potential’ [15]. Diagnosis of NIFTP requires a scrupu-\nlous pathological examination of the follicular-pattern nodule to\nconﬁdently exclude the presence of capsular invasion (even\nmicroscopic) and papillary formations. RAS but not BRAF muta-\ntions characterise NIFTPs. Correct identiﬁcation of NIFTPs\nshould reduce the unnecessary use of radical surgical procedures\nand the needless administration of radioactive iodine (RAI) after\na completion thyroidectomy. NIFTP follow-up strategies should\nmimic those of very-low risk carcinomas (see following sections).\nThere are numerous other PTC variants, including some that are\nparticularly aggressive and associated with higher tumour stages\nand lymph node metastases at diagnosis. The best-known of these\nare the tall cell, columnar, hobnail and solid variants [16, 17].\nThe WHO currently recommends reporting FTCs as ‘minimal-\nly invasive’ when capsular penetration is present without vascular\ninvolvement (a condition associated with an extremely good\nprognosis). The terms ‘angioinvasive’ and ‘widely invasive’\nshould be reserved for follicular cancers with neoplastic emboli\ninvolving <4 or \u00034 blood vessels, respectively.\nThe diagnostic criteria for poorly differentiated carcinomas re-\nmain controversial. A consensus conference in 2006 yielded the\nTurin proposal [18], which restricts this diagnosis to invasive\ntumours with a solid/trabecular/insular growth pattern plus at\nleast one of the following:\n• mitotic index \u00033 per 10 high-power ﬁelds;\n• necrosis;\n• convoluted nuclei (slightly smaller and darker than those typ-\nically seen in PTC, with irregular contours).\nThis deﬁnition delimits a category of TCs that behave aggres-\nsively while maintaining some degree of functional differenti-\nation [e.g. thyroglobulin (Tg) production].\nHu¨rthle cell carcinomas are no longer classiﬁed as ‘follicular\ntumours’, which are generally much less aggressive and less likely\nto present with lymph node metastases [16]. Hu¨rthle cell carcino-\nmas associated with extensive vascular and/or capsular invasion\nshould be managed like other high-risk carcinomas (see following\nsections). ‘Pure’ Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas (i.e., those with a\nHu¨rthle-cell component exceeding 75%) also present molecular\nabnormalities that distinguish them from conventional follicular\ncarcinomas. As for oncocytic PTCs and oncocytic variants of\npoorly differentiated carcinomas, they are no more aggressive\nthan their conventional counterparts.\nMolecular proﬁling has distinguished two major classes of PTCs\ncharacterised by BRAF-predominant and RAS-predominant mo-\nlecular signatures (Table 1) [19]. BRAF V600E mutations are fre-\nquently reported in a subgroup of PTCs with more aggressive\nclinicopathological behaviours, but the need for routine BRAF gen-\notyping of PTCs has not been established. The fatal forms of non-\nATC are generally PTC variants harbouring BRAF or RAS\nmutations plus other genomic alterations (e.g. mutations involving\nthe TERT promoter, TP53, POLE, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway\neffectors, SWI/SNF subunits and/or histone methyltransferases),\nsome of which are potential therapeutic targets [20]. The molecular\nproﬁles of follicular and Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas are less well-\ndeﬁned. Work is underway to deﬁne the genomic and transcrip-\ntomic proﬁles of poorly differentiated and anaplastic TCs [21, 22].\nStaging and risk assessment\nMortality risk. The Union for International Cancer Control\n(UICC) tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation of malig-\nnant tumours stages lesions based on their mortality risks. The\neighth edition [23] introduced important changes for thyroid\ntumours, including the downstaging of extrathyroidal extension\nthat is not macroscopically evident (pT3b) (Table 2). Primaries\nwith extrathyroidal spread that is exclusively microscopic are\nnow staged solely on the basis of tumour size as pT1, pT2 or\npT3a. TNM staging requires a complete review of prognostically\nrelevant morphological and immune-phenotypic parameters\n[20]. A checklist containing these parameters can be included in\nthe ﬁnal pathology report [IV, A] to supply details on the extent\nof invasion (capsular versus vascular, including number of\naffected vessels), tumour size and architecture, presence of necro-\nsis, proliferative activity, etc. [10].\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1857\n\n---\nRisk of persistent or recurrent disease. Table 3 summarises the\nsystem developed in 2015 by the American Thyroid Association\n(ATA) to estimate the risk of persistent or recurrent TC based on\ndata available shortly after treatment of the primary cancer\n[8, 24–26]. These criteria have now been revised and reﬁned\nbased on emerging evidence. The likelihood of persistent/recur-\nrent disease after an apparently complete resection depends on\nseveral factors. The overall estimated risk of recurrence ranges\nfrom <1% to 55% and is classiﬁed as low (\u00025%), intermediate\n(6%–20%) or high (>20%). A high-quality pathology report is\ncrucial for proper risk stratiﬁcation.\nThe initial risk class assignment is revised during follow-up to\nreﬂect the evolution of the disease and responses to treatments\n(dynamic\nrisk\nstratiﬁcation)\n[IV,\nA]\n[27–30].\nTreatment\nresponses are deﬁned as excellent, biochemical incomplete, struc-\ntural incomplete or indeterminate based on imaging ﬁndings >\n[mainly neck ultrasound (US)] and serum Tg and anti-Tg anti-\nbody (TgAb) levels (see Table 4) [8].\nPrimary tumour management\nSurgery. Primary tumour management will be determined by the\nresults of the preoperative risk assessment (Figure 1). Active US\nsurveillance of the thyroid and neck lymph nodes (every 6–\n12 months) can be proposed for unifocal papillary microcarcino-\nmas (\u000210 mm) with no evidence of extracapsular extension or\nlymph node metastases [III, B] [31]. In these cases, the only\nknown predictor of signiﬁcant tumour growth (\u00033 mm) or the\nonset of lymph node metastasis is age (10-year estimated risks:\n36% in patients <30 years old, 14% in those aged 30–50, 6% in\npatients 50–60 years old) [32].\nFor other TCs, total thyroidectomy is still considered the stand-\nard surgical treatment. Two large database studies on surgical man-\nagement strategies found that, for selected low-risk tumours (T1a–\nT1b–T2, N0), lobectomy alone does not reduce OS [IV, B] [33,\n34], but it may be associated with a slightly higher local recurrence\n[8]. However, even large database studies are subject to biases. In\nrisk-beneﬁt analyses, it is important to recall that total thyroidec-\ntomy can cause recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.5%, bilateral in\nrare cases) and temporary or permanent hypoparathyroidism\n(8.1%) [35]. The risk (even when done by high-volume surgeons)\nis almost twice that of lobectomy alone, and postoperative compli-\ncations are generally more likely with low-volume surgeons [36].\nThe use of prophylactic central neck dissection for low-risk\ntumours (T1b–T2, N0) varies from centre to centre [IV, C]\n[37–39]. Evidence of its effect on recurrence-free survival is con-\nﬂicting, and there is no high-level evidence for or against its use-\nfulness for low-risk tumours. Studies supporting prophylactic\nneck dissection for low-risk tumours have shown moderate\nreductions in central neck recurrence (5%–10%) but no im-\nprovement in OS. Prophylactic neck dissection does allow more\ncomplete staging of neck nodes, including identiﬁcation of\nmicrometastases not visible on preoperative US, and this infor-\nmation can be used to reﬁne the prognosis and guide subsequent\ntreatment and follow-up. Risks, however, include temporary\nhypoparathyroidism and overdiagnosis and overtreatment of\nsubclinical micrometastases. The potential beneﬁts of prophylac-\ntic neck dissection for low-risk tumours are now being evaluated\nin an RCT (NCT03570021—ESTIMABL3). For more invasive\ntumours (T3–T4), prophylactic neck dissection may improve re-\ngional control [IV, C] [40].\nRAI therapy. RAI is administered after total thyroidectomy for\nseveral reasons:\n• to eliminate the normal thyroid remnant, thereby ensuring\nundetectable serum Tg levels (in the absence of neoplastic tis-\nsue), which facilitate follow-up (remnant ablation);\n• to irradiate presumed foci of neoplastic cells, thereby reduc-\ning the recurrence risk (adjuvant therapy); and/or\nTable 1.

Some authors consider it a more aggressive form of DTC. When associated with extensive vascular and/or capsular invasion,\nthe recurrence risk should be classiﬁed as high. For minimally invasive Hu¨rthle cell carcinoma, robust data are lacking on the true risk of recurrence.\nfThe BRAF V600E mutation is associated with aggressive histologic features, lymph node metastases and ETE, but its relative contribution to the risk of recur-\nrence is not well-deﬁned. Co-existing BRAF V600E and TERT mutations act synergically to increase the risk of recurrence [25, 26].\n131I, iodine-131; ATA, American Thyroid Association; DTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; ERR, estimated risk of recurrence; ETE, extrathyroidal extension; FTC,\nfollicular thyroid cancer; NIFTP, non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features; PTC, papillary thyroid cancer; RAI, radioactive\niodine; Tg, thyroglobulin; WHO, World Health Organization.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1860 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\n• to treat persistent or recurrent disease (treatment of known\ndisease) [8].\nIn all three cases, RAI administration must be followed by an\niodine-131 (131I) whole-body scan (WBS) to stage the disease\nand document the 131I avidity of any structural lesion. The esti-\nmated level of risk for persistent/recurrent disease will deter-\nmine whether and how much RAI is given. Low activities are\nusually given for remnant ablation (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq); high\nactivities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) are used for treatment pur-\nposes. To optimise isotope uptake, RAI should be given after\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation, which can be\nachieved by withdrawing levothyroxine for 4–5 weeks, ideally\nuntil serum TSH levels reach \u000330 mIU/ml. Alternatively, re-\ncombinant human TSH (rhTSH) can be given (two daily injec-\ntions of 0.9 mg of rhTSH followed by RAI on day 3). The\nresulting TSH level is not usually measured (unless doubts arise\nas to whether the injections have been properly administered).\nLevothyroxine withdrawal is preferred if distant metastases are\npresent. The use of rhTSH is associated with superior short-\nterm QoL [41].\nAs shown in Figure 2, practice guidelines unanimously recom-\nmend treatment with high RAI activities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq)\nfor patients with high risk of recurrence [IV, A] [7–10, 42]. RAI\nadministration is not recommended for certain low-risk patients\n[i.e. those with a small (\u00021 cm) intrathyroidal DTC and no evi-\ndence of locoregional metastases] [II, E] [43]. The term ‘very\nlow-risk’ is often applied to these patients in the literature [7, 44].\nThere is less consensus regarding other low-risk DTC patients\n[IV, C] (see Table 3). In 2015, the ATA guidelines advised against\nthe systematic use of RAI in the latter group [8]. However, the\nEuropean Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) has not\nendorsed this recommendation [45], mainly because prospective\nRCT data showing that surveillance is non-inferior to RAI ad-\nministration are lacking. The ATA, the EANM, the Society of\nNuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) and the\nEuropean Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published a\njoint statement acknowledging the absence of high-quality evi-\ndence either for or against the postoperative use of 131I in low-\nrisk patients [46]. They conclude that decisions should be taken\non an individual basis, depending on tumour features (e.g. risk of\nrecurrence) (see Table 3), patient-related factors (e.g. comorbid-\nities, motivation, emotional concerns), health-care setting (e.g.\navailability and quality of thyroid surgeons, US, RAI imaging, Tg\nassays) and the local management team’s preferences. Lastly, the\nexpected beneﬁts of a given RAI dose should outweigh the risks\nassociated with its administration, which include adverse events\n(AEs) and diminished QoL [43]. The usefulness of 131I therapy in\nlow-risk TC patients is now being assessed in two large RCTs\n(NCT01837745—ESTIMABL2,\nNCT01398085—IoN).\nTwo\nother RCTs (ESTIMABL1 and HiLo) conducted in low-risk DTC\npopulations showed that, if RAI is given in these cases, low activ-\nities (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq) following rhTSH and high activities\n(100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) following levothyroxine withdrawal are\nequally likely to produce successful ablation [I, A] [47, 48]. This\nequivalence is also evident at the level of recurrence-free survival,\nTable 4.

RAI adjuvant therapy can\nbe considered for intermediate-risk patients. Decisions on RAI\ndosage and TSH stimulation modalities are based on case\nfeatures—surgical, clinical and pathological (particularly the ex-\ntent of lymph node involvement and the aggressiveness of the\npathological subtype) [IV, B] [43]. If given, low to high activities\n(30 mCi, 1.1 GBq to 100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) are recommended. In\nthese patients, the ATA recommends individualised decision\nmaking [8].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up tools and schedules (Figure 3) vary according to the\ntumour histotype, initial treatment, initial risk of persistent/re-\ncurrent disease (Table 3) and responses to treatment (Table 4).\nSerum Tg assays and neck US are the mainstays of DTC follow-\nup [51]. Patient management can be improved when health pro-\nfessionals collaborate as members of a multidisciplinary team.\nSerum Tg. Serum Tg is a sensitive marker for the presence of thy-\nrocytes, but it cannot discriminate between normal and\nmalignant cells. Undetectable levels thus have high negative pre-\ndictive values, but detectable values can be false-positives. To\nminimise variability, Tg levels should ideally be measured with\nthe same assay [52]. Concomitant assessment of serum TgAb is\nmandatory, as these antibodies can interfere with Tg assays, caus-\ning false-negative or, less commonly, false-positive results [53].\nSerum Tg can be assayed under basal conditions (i.e. during levo-\nthyroxine treatment) or after endogenous (levothyroxine with-\ndrawal) or exogenous (rhTSH injection) TSH stimulation. In\npatients treated with total thyroidectomy plus RAI remnant abla-\ntion, stimulated serum Tg levels <1 ng/ml are highly predictive of\nan excellent response to therapy, and subsequent stimulated Tg\nassays are unnecessary [54]. High-sensitivity (<0.2 ng/ml) assays\nof basal Tg levels can also be used to verify the absence of disease\n(excellent response) [II, B] [55]. If negative imaging ﬁndings are\naccompanied by detectable Tg levels, the treatment response is\nclassiﬁed as indeterminate or biochemical incomplete (Table 4).\nIn this case, the positive predictive value increases with the serum\nTg level or, if serial measurements are available, with levels that\nincrease over time.

When\nserum Tg levels are detectable, serial measurements of Tg should\nbe obtained on levothyroxine treatment [IV, B] [56, 57]. A simi-\nlar approach might be used following lobectomy [IV, C] [28].\nIncreasing Tg levels are highly suspicious for persistent/recurrent\nDTC, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nNeck US. Neck US is the most effective tool for detecting struc-\ntural disease in the neck, particularly when remnants of normal\nthyroid tissue are present. Combined with the results of FNA cy-\ntology [58] and serum Tg assays, neck US ﬁndings can achieve an\naccuracy of nearly 100% [59]. The shortcomings of US include\nsubstantial operator dependency [60], a high frequency of non-\nspeciﬁc ﬁndings [61] and the possibility of unsatisfactory visual-\nisation of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by\nbone or air. The latter sites are better explored with cross-\nsectional imaging modalities (see below). Abnormal US ﬁndings\ncan be classiﬁed as indeterminate or truly suspicious (Table 5)\n[62, 63]. Unlike PTC, FTC metastasis is typically haematogenous\nand rarely involves the locoregional lymph nodes, so neck US in\nthese cases serves mainly to exclude residual/recurrent thyroid-\nbed disease.\nOther imaging studies.

Recommendations for postoperative management of DTC patients.\naIsolated measurements of serum Tg cannot be reliably interpreted in the presence of normal thyroid tissue. The trend over time of basal Tg\nshould be used in patients with residual thyroid tissue and might also be used in case of lobectomy. Rising Tg is highly suspicious for persist-\nent/recurrent disease, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nbHighly sensitive (<0.2 ng/ml) assays of basal Tg can be used in lieu of TSH-stimulated Tg to verify the absence of disease.\ncIn patients with serum TSH level of 0.5–2 mIU/ml after lobectomy, levothyroxine replacement therapy is not mandatory.\ndIn patients with excellent response to therapy, repeat neck US may be avoided.\neShort serum Tg doubling time (<1 year) is associated with poor outcome in DTC patients [72] and should prompt imaging staging.\nfShort tumour growth doubling time (<1 year) may guide the choice of starting a treatment [95].\ngIf FDG is normal, WBS can be carried out after the administration of a therapeutic activity.\nDTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; FDG, ﬂuorodeoxyglucose; FDG–PET, [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomography;\nON-LT4-Tg, thyroglobulin measurement on levothyroxine; q x months, every x months; RAI, radioactive iodine; rhTSH, recombinant human\nthyroid stimulating hormone; RRA, radioiodine remnant ablation; RxWBS, therapeutic whole-body iodine-131 scan; Tg, thyroglobulin; TgAb,\nserum thyroglobulin antibody; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total thyroidectomy; US, ultrasound; WBS, whole-body scan.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1864 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nTgAb levels in the absence of sonographically identiﬁable neck\ndisease or in patients with intermediate-to-high risks of persist-\nent/recurrent disease, irrespective of the neck US ﬁndings)\n[IV, B] [8].\nA WBS can be carried out after the administration of diagnostic\nor therapeutic doses of RAI. Because its sensitivity is low (27%–\n55%), diagnostic WBS is not indicated during follow-up [IV, A]\n[64]. Uptake is highly speciﬁc (91%–100%) for the presence of\nthyroid tissue, but false-positive results are possible. In these cases,\nsingle-photon emission computed tomography or computed\ntomography (CT) offers better anatomic resolution [64].\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomog-\nraphy (FDG–PET) combined with CT is useful for assessing the\nextent of disease and deﬁning the prognosis [65, 66]. Its sensitiv-\nity is around 94%, and speciﬁcity is between 80% and 84%.\nFDG–PET is more sensitive than therapeutic WBS for detecting\npersistent disease in patients with negative cross-sectional imag-\ning studies, serum Tg levels >10 ng/dl, and/or aggressive histo-\ntypes (e.g. aggressive PTC, poorly differentiated TC, widely\ninvasive follicular carcinoma) [67]. FDG uptake is associated\nwith a worse prognosis and refractoriness to RAI treatment [68,\n69], but it is not a reliable predictor of tumour growth [70].\nFDG–PET is the ﬁrst-line isotopic imaging technique for patients\nwith RAI-refractory disease.\nCross-sectional imaging modalities should be chosen on\nthe basis of the anatomic region to be explored. CT is best for\nneck and chest imaging. Contrast enhancement is used for\nstudies of the neck and mediastinal lymph nodes but not\nfor the lungs. All forms of RAI treatment should be deferred\nfor at least 6 weeks after administration of any iodinated con-\ntrast medium. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imag-\ning (MRI) is appropriate for exploring the neck, liver,\nbones and brain [64]. MRI of the neck is subject to\nsubstantial image degradation due to respiratory motion,\nand a CT scan is often a better alternative. Suspected\naerodigestive-tract involvement should always be assessed\nendoscopically.\nFollow-up strategies. All patients with DTC should have neck US\nand serum Tg and TgAb assays 6–18 months after primary\ntreatment (surgery 6 RAI therapy). The subsequent follow-up\nschedule will depend on the initially estimated risk of persistent/\nrecurrent disease and responses to therapy (Figure 3).\nPTC patients at low risk for recurrence who have no evidence\nof structural disease at the ﬁrst follow-up visit can be monitored\nwith periodic (12–24 months) Tg and TgAb assessments. Repeat\nneck US scans can be carried out as needed, depending on serum\nTg and TgAb levels [71]. The same schedule can be adopted for\nintermediate-risk PTC patients with excellent responses to treat-\nment [IV, A] [27, 30, 44]. TSH levels should be maintained in the\nlow-normal range (0.5–2 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. The follow-up\nprotocol for minimally invasive FTCs is often the same one used\nfor low-risk PTCs, although the evidence supporting such an ap-\nproach is insufﬁcient [V, C] [24].\nLow- or intermediate-risk PTC patients with a biochemical in-\ncomplete or indeterminate response to treatment should have\nserum Tg and TgAb assays and a neck US every 6–12 months.\nRising Tg or TgAb levels warrant further imaging studies [72].\nMild TSH suppression should be considered (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) in\npatients at intermediate risk of recurrence [IV, B] [8].\nIn patients with high-risk PTCs, poorly differentiated TCs or\nwidely invasive FTCs, serum Tg and TgAb levels should be\nassessed every 6–12 months if the response to therapy is excellent\nor biochemical indeterminate/incomplete. Cross-sectional or\nfunctional imaging studies should be repeated if detectable Tg\nlevels persist [IV, B] [27, 30]. For patients whose recurrence risk\nis initially classiﬁed as high, a more in-depth imaging work-up\nmay be advisable even if serum Tg levels remain or become un-\ndetectable, as the absence of the circulating Tg may simply reﬂect\nthe dedifferentiation of any residual tumour tissue that might be\npresent [8]. Serum TSH levels should be suppressed in all patients\nwith biochemical incomplete or indeterminate responses to treat-\nment (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. Patients with structural in-\ncomplete responses can be placed on active surveillance or\nreferred for local or systemic treatments.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nDistant metastases occur in fewer than 10% of patients with\nDTC. Half are present when the tumour is ﬁrst discovered; the\nothers are found later, sometimes decades after initial treatment.\nMetastases are observed most frequently in patients with aggres-\nsive histological subtypes (e.g. tall-cell, hobnail, solid, diffuse\nsclerosing and columnar-cell variants): vascular invasion, large\nprimary tumours, macroscopic extrathyroidal extension, bulky\nlocoregional nodal disease [8]. The most common sites are lungs\nand bones (involved in 49% and 25% of all cases, respectively),\nand in 15% of cases, both are affected [73]. Bone metastases are\nmore common in FTC than in PTC (55.5% versus 31.5%, re-\nspectively). Spinal (34.6%) and pelvic (25.5%) bones are the\nmost frequently involved, followed by those of the chest (18.3%),\nextremities\n(10.2%),\nshoulder\ngirdle\n(5.4%)\nand\nthe\nTable 5.

Brain, liver and skin in-\nvolvement is less common. The overall mortality rates 5 and\n10 years after diagnosis of distant metastases are 65% and 75%,\nrespectively [75].\nDistant metastases are usually diagnosed because of clinical\nsymptoms or suspicious imaging/laboratory ﬁndings (abnormal\nuptake on a post-ablation WBS, or a positive ﬁnding on an FDG–\nPET-CT scan or a cross-sectional study prompted by elevated Tg\nlevels in patients whose post-ablation WBS is negative).\nRAI therapy. Patients with distant metastases should receive 100–\n200 mCi (3.7–7.4 GBq) of 131I after TSH stimulation [IV, A] [73].\nThe latter can be achieved with levothyroxine withdrawal or, if\nwithdrawal is clinically contraindicated or the patients has hypo-\npituitarism, with injections of rhTSH (Figure 2). One-third of\npatients have lesions that are not RAI-avid and are considered\nRAI-refractory [IV, A] (Figure 2) [73, 76]. If the distant metasta-\nses are RAI-avid, 131I is administered every 6 months for 2 years\nand less frequently thereafter. Between treatments, suppressive\ndoses of levothyroxine are given to maintain serum TSH levels\nbelow 0.1 mIU/ml (unless there are speciﬁc contraindications)\n[III, B] [77–79]. Data from some prospective cohort studies sug-\ngest that disease progression, recurrence and death rates are\nreduced in patients undergoing TSH suppression for structurally\nidentiﬁable disease [77, 79], but it is still unclear how much sup-\npression is appropriate [78]. Between treatments, efﬁcacy should\nbe veriﬁed with periodic cross-sectional imaging studies.\nCompared with repeated administrations of standard doses of\nRAI (100 mCi or 3.7 GBq), use of higher, dosimetrically deter-\nmined activities appears to offer no beneﬁts in terms of OS [80].\nWhen distant metastases lose their ability to concentrate RAI or\nstructural progression occurs within 6–12 months after RAI ad-\nministration, the disease is considered RAI-refractory [IV, A]\n(Figure 2) [73, 76]. A cure is unlikely if lesions persist after ad-\nministration of a cumulative dose of 600 mCi 131I, and decisions\non whether to continue RAI therapy will be based on tumour\nburden, RAI-uptake intensity and responses to previous RAI\nadministrations [73].\nOverall, one out of three patients with distant metastases will\nbe cured with RAI and have a near-normal life expectancy [73].\nThese are usually young individuals with well-differentiated TC\nand small non-FDG-avid metastatic lesions. The other patients\nwill at some point be classiﬁed as RAI-refractory; the prognosis in\nthese cases will vary, depending mainly on the tumour burden\nand growth rate. Overall, their 5-year survival is <50%. RAI re-\nfractoriness, however, remains uncommon, with an estimated in-\ncidence of 4–5 cases per million population. Drugs for re-\ninducing or increasing RAI uptake by the tumours are currently\nunder investigation. The selective kinase inhibitors dabrafenib\n[81], vemurafenib [82] and selumetinib [83] can reportedly re-\nstore RAI uptake and tumour responses in selected patients, espe-\ncially in those with small tumour burden and low progression\nrate. Several trials are underway to validate these preliminary data\n(NCT03244956, NCT02456701, NCT02145143, NCT02152995,\nNCT03363347), but thus far, none of the three drugs has been\napproved for this indication.\nLocoregional therapy. Several locoregional approaches can be\nused to treat TC. The data and indications discussed below,\nhowever, are based mainly on studies of other solid tumours.\nSpeciﬁc recommendations are lacking for DTC or MTC patients;\ntherefore, the indications for locoregional treatments of these\ntumours will be discussed together. ATC patients will be dis-\ncussed separately, as their poor prognosis is a major factor in all\ntreatment decisions.\nBone metastases: The relatively long survival perspective places\nTC patients with bone metastases at high risk of skeletal-related\nevents (SREs), i.e. pathological fractures, spinal cord compres-\nsion, need for radiation (for pain or impending fracture) or sur-\ngery and hypercalcaemia. Up to 37% of TC patients experience\nSREs, and they are associated with poorer prognoses [84, 85].\nThere is a strong rationale and some clinical data supporting\nthe roles for bone resorption inhibitors (bisphosphonates or\ndenosumab) [V, B], external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or other\nlocoregional treatments in reducing SREs [86]. Bisphosphonates\nand denosumab have each been shown to decrease SRE rates and\nbone pain associated with breast, prostate and lung cancers.\nInhibition of bone resorption should be considered in TC\npatients with multiple bone metastases. Treatment can be admin-\nistered every 4 weeks (bisphosphonates and denosumab) or every\n3 months (bisphosphonates). The optimal duration of treatment\nis unknown, but in other more thoroughly studied tumours (e.g.\nbreast, prostate, lung), a minimum of 2 years is recommended.\nAdequate calcium and vitamin D levels should be maintained\nduring treatment. The most signiﬁcant AE of these drugs is jaw\nosteonecrosis, and the risk is increased in patients receiving\nantiangiogenic therapy [87]. A baseline dental evaluation is\nthus mandatory before starting treatment with bone resorption\ninhibitors, and regular checkups are recommended during\ntreatment.\nIf the bone metastases are RAI-avid, RAI therapy may control\nthe disease for some time and alleviate or delay symptoms, but it\nis unlikely to eliminate these lesions. Locoregional treatments\nmay allow longer progression-free intervals and even cures in\npatients with targetable, oligometastatic bone disease. Surgery\nfollowed by EBRT is associated with the best outcomes, at least\nfor limb lesions [88]. If surgery is not feasible, bone lesions associ-\nated with pain or a high fracture risk should be treated with frac-\ntionated (20 Gy in ﬁve fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions) or\nsingle-fraction (8 Gy) EBRT and/or with interventional radiology\ntechniques, including cementoplasty and thermal ablation [89].\nFor spinal cord compression in a patient whose life expectancy\nexceeds 6 months, longer fractionation schedules (e.g. 30 Gy in 10\nfractions over 2 weeks) are recommended. If the life expectancy is\n\u00026 months, a single fraction of 8 or 20 Gy in ﬁve fractions should\nbe used to minimise hospitalisation [II, B] [90].\nPercutaneous vertebroplasty can reduce the pain and deform-\nity associated with vertebral body fractures. The efﬁcacy of this\ninnovative approach has not been directly compared with surgery\nand should only be done in high-volume centres to minimise the\nrisk of complications (e.g. cement leakage outside the bone).\nThere is limited evidence that other conservative techniques\n[radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryotherapy] are effective for\ntreating TC-related bone lesions [V, B] [91].\nPalliative EBRT alleviates pain and neurological complications.\nPain relief is often achieved 48–72 h after treatment, although it\nmay take up to 1 month.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1866 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nLung metastases: The lung is a common site of TC metastasis.\nThe lesions are usually multiple, bilateral, of varying size (from a\nfew millimetres to 1 cm) and asymptomatic. Metastasectomy is\nnot the standard approach for these lesions, but it may be consid-\nered for oligometastasis in patients with good performance status\n(PS) [V, C]. RFA is also a possibility for solitary lesions or those\ncausing a speciﬁc symptom due to their volume and location [V,\nC]. RFA is considered for lesions <2–3 cm in patients not eligible\nfor surgery or those requiring an extensive resection [92].\nLiver metastases: Liver metastases are rare in DTC but more\ncommon in MTC. Liver involvement usually presents with mul-\ntiple lesions, but if true solitary lesions are detected, they may be\ncandidates for local ablation. In MTC patients with a dominant\nlesion that is growing more rapidly than the background dis-\nease, local ablation (e.g. RFA) may be useful for controlling\nsymptoms, systemic ones in particular, such as diarrhoea. The\noutcome of RFA will depend on the size of the lesion (optimally\n<30 mm), its location (at least 3 mm from all vessels) and its\nvisibility on US. Direct comparisons of surgery and RFA are\nlacking. In general, individuals who are ineligible for surgery are\nnot the best candidates for percutaneous ablation. If both sur-\ngery and RFA are contraindicated, hepatic intra-arterial embol-\nisation with drug-eluting beads might be an option: it has been\nused in other solid tumours [93] but its efﬁcacy in TC has not\nbeen validated.\nInvasion of upper aerodigestive tract: Invasion of the upper\naerodigestive tract should always be excluded in TC patients with\nlocoregional disease. Suspicious symptoms include haemoptysis\nand dysphagia. Contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI are helpful\nfor exploring suspicious cases, although endoscopy is more de-\nﬁnitive. In selected cases (e.g. bleeding, exophytic lesions), local\ntreatment (e.g. laser excision) is advisable before starting antian-\ngiogenic multikinase inhibitor (MKI) therapy.\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. TSH suppression\n(serum level <0.1 lIU/ml) is recommended for all TC patients\nwith persistent structural disease in the absence of speciﬁc contra-\nindications [III, B] [77].

Temporal trends in the levels of\nserum tumour markers (e.g. Tg doubling time) can be used to\nsupport and help decision making [95]. Importantly, however,\nan increase in serum Tg levels in the absence of radiologically evi-\ndent disease progression should not be used to select patients\nrequiring systemic therapy. A complete cross-sectional imaging\nassessment of the extent of the disease is mandatory for any treat-\nment decisions. RECIST v1.1 are used to deﬁne target lesions and\nmeasure responses to systemic treatment [94]. The imaging as-\nsessment should be repeated every 3–12 weeks during treatment.\nReductions in serum Tg are expected in responders, but clinical\ndecisions cannot be based on this parameter alone.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Lenvatinib and sorafenib should be\nconsidered the standard ﬁrst-line systemic therapy for RAI-\nrefractory DTC [I, A; ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 scores: 3 for lenvatinib, 2 for sorafenib].\nLenvatinib and sorafenib have been approved by the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) and the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration\n(FDA)\nfor\nprogressive,\nmetastatic,\nRAI-\nrefractory DTC. Both drugs have been investigated in two large,\nrandomised phase III trials (sorafenib in DECISION [96], lenva-\ntinib in SELECT [97]). Head-to-head comparisons of the two\nagents have not been undertaken. They cannot be compared\nbased on their performances in the RCTs cited above, which dif-\nfered substantially in terms of enrolment criteria. Unlike the\nDECISION population, participants in SELECT underwent man-\ndatory assessment of radiological disease progression at entry by\nan independent committee, and pre-treated patients were not\nexcluded. In addition, progression-free survival (PFS) in the pla-\ncebo arm of SELECT was shorter than that of DECISION, which\nalso suggests that the SELECT trial population may have had\nmore advanced or more active disease than that of the\nDECISION study.\nIn the DECISION trial, 417 patients were randomised (1 : 1)\nto treatment with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo,\nwith crossover permitted at disease progression [96]. The study\ndemonstrated that sorafenib signiﬁcantly prolongs PFS [me-\ndian PFS (mPFS) 10.8 versus 5.8 months with placebo, hazard\nratio (HR) 0.59, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.45–0.76,\nP ¼ 0.001]. Objective responses (all partial) occurred in 12% of\nthe sorafenib group and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients\n(P < 0.0001). The median response duration was 10.2 months\n(95% CI 7.4–16.6). Stable disease lasting \u00036 months (post hoc\nanalysis) was observed more frequently with sorafenib (82/196\npatients, 41.8% versus 67/202 patients, 33.2% in the placebo\ngroup). Disease control (partial response or disease stability\nlasting \u00036 months; post hoc analysis) was achieved in 106/196\npatients (54.1%) treated with sorafenib and 33.8% (68/201\npatients) of those receiving placebo (P < 0.0001). Most patients\n(71.4%) receiving placebo crossed over to sorafenib, and 20.3%\nof patients in sorafenib arm and 8.6% of patients in placebo\narm received additional therapies.

In this trial, TC appeared to be\nmore aggressive in older people, as reﬂected by the mOS\nof 18.4 months (95% CI 13.3–20.3) reached in placebo-treated\npatients >65 years compared with that in younger subjects, which\nhad not been reached when the results were published [99].\nThe optimal sequence of MKIs in RAI-refractory DTC cannot\nbe determined based on currently available evidence. Previous\nMKI therapy is not a contraindication for subsequent use of\nthese drugs, but data on second-line efﬁcacy are scarce [II, C].\nMKIs should be continued until the disease progresses, un-\nacceptable toxicities occur or the patient asks to stop treatment.\nIn the presence of single-site progression, locoregional treatment\n(e.g. EBRT, embolisation, percutaneous treatment modalities)\ncan be done for local control, without discontinuing MKIs [V,\nC]. Data on real life experiences with lenvatinib in DTC patients\nare now available and as expected, the drug’s efﬁcacy was not as\ngood as that observed in highly selected RCT populations [100,\n101]. Other antiangiogenic agents have been tested as ﬁrst-line\ntherapy in phase II trials, with widely varying response rates\n(Table 6) [102–110]. None of these agents has been approved yet\nfor RAI-resistant DTC. MKIs with speciﬁc targets [e.g. BRAF,\ntropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK)] have also been used.\nVemurafenib has reportedly displayed activity against BRAF\nV600E TCs in both MKI-naive [overall response rate (ORR)\n38.5%, 95% CI 20.2–59.4] and pre-treated patients (ORR 27.3%,\n95% CI 10.7–50.2) [81, 111]. Larotrectinib has been recently\napproved by the FDA and the EMA for all paediatric and adult\ncancers expressing the TRK gene fusion protein. Partial\nresponses were observed in all ﬁve TC patients treated with this\ndrug in a recently reported phase I/II trial [112]. There is a bio-\nlogical rationale for treating advanced TCs with antiangiogenetic\nagents plus immune checkpoint inhibitors [113], and an RCT is\ncurrently underway to assess the activity of lenvatinib plus pem-\nbrolizumab in this setting (NCT02973997).\nAEs of MKIs: AEs occurred in 98.6% of patients receiving sora-\nfenib during the DECISION trial [96]: hand–foot syndrome,\ndiarrhoea, alopaecia, rash or desquamation, fatigue, weight loss\nand hypertension were the most common. Serum TSH levels\nexceeding 0.5 mIU/ml were observed in 33.3% patients (69/207)\nin the sorafenib arm. TSH increases are a recognised AE of sorafe-\nnib and other MKIs, and levels should be checked monthly to en-\nsure that suppression is maintained.\nSerious AEs were documented in 37.2% (77/207) of the\nsorafenib-treated participants. Nine developed a second malig-\nnancy: squamous-cell skin cancer in seven cases (one patient also\nhad melanoma), acute myeloid leukaemia and bladder cancer in\nthe remaining two cases. Skin cancer is a consequence of sorafe-\nnib’s paradoxical activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase\nsignalling in keratinocytes harbouring mutated or activated RAS.\nIn clinical practice, skin cancer can be resected surgically with\ncurative intent and sorafenib continued, but monitoring and\nearly intervention for skin lesions is essential. The high rate of\nAEs inevitably diminishes treatment compliance. In DECISION,\nwhere the mean daily dose was 651 mg, AEs frequently led to\ntreatment interruptions (137/207 patients, 66.2%), dose reduc-\ntions (133 patients, 64.3%) or drug withdrawals (39 patients,\n18.8%).\nIn SELECT, at least one side-effect also occurred in all\nlenvatinib-treated patients [114], the most common being hyper-\ntension, diarrhoea, fatigue, proteinuria, rash and hand–foot syn-\ndrome. Treatment interruptions (82.4% of patients) and dose\nreductions (67.8%) led to a mean daily lenvatinib dose of 17.2 mg\n[97]. AEs generally occurred during the ﬁrst few weeks of treat-\nment and decreased rapidly after treatment is interrupted. A trial\ncomparing lenvatinib starting doses of 24 versus 18 mg is current-\nly recruiting (NCT02657369). More selective agents such as laro-\ntrectinib for TRK fusion-positive cancers and highly selective\nRET inhibitors (e.g. LOXO 292, BLU 667) have better toxicity\nproﬁles. Off-target side-effects are uncommon with these drugs,\nand toxicities are mild and manageable, mostly of grades 1 and 2\n[112, 115].\nPhysicians, patients and caregivers should be aware of these\nAEs. Caught early, they can be effectively managed, but preven-\ntion, when feasible, is always advisable [116]. The aim should be\nto manage the side-effects successfully without resorting to dose\nor treatment schedule adjustments, which can have detrimental\neffects on treatment efﬁcacy. A post hoc analysis of the impact of\ndose interruption on lenvatinib efﬁcacy in SELECT trial partici-\npants revealed that longer interruptions and lower mean dose\nintensities may diminish the potential beneﬁt conferred by the\ndrug [117]. As MKIs may cause fatal harm when administered to\na pregnant woman and may result in reduced fertility in both\nsexes, fertility preservation approaches should be discussed be-\nfore treatment starts [118].\nConventional cytotoxic therapy: The results of chemotherapy\n(ChT) administration (e.g. doxorubicin) in RAI-refractory DTC\nare disappointing; therefore, it is not recommended unless MKI\ntherapy is contraindicated.\nATC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nATCs are very rare tumours that usually present at an advanced\nstage, display extremely aggressive behaviour, and are associated\nwith a very poor prognosis. They are morphologically heteroge-\nneous and must be distinguished from other neck tumours,\nincluding squamous carcinoma of the larynx, sarcomas and lym-\nphomas. Preoperative biopsy assessment includes diagnostic\nimmunomarkers that can differentiate ATC from large cell\nlymphoma or pleomorphic sarcoma. The molecular proﬁle of\nATC includes mutations of the TERT promoter (associated with\nBRAF or RAS mutations) and TP53 [21, 22], as well as targetable\nabnormalities (e.g. NTRK and ALK rearrangements).\nStaging and risk assessment\nIn the eighth edition of the UICC TNM staging system [23], diag-\nnosis of ATC is no longer associated with pT4 stage by default.\nCases treated with resection are staged like other TC histotypes,\nbased on tumour size and extension (Table 2).\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1869\n\n---\nATCs are considered one of the most aggressive solid tumours\nin humans. The median survival after the initial diagnosis is\n\u00054 months and only one out of ﬁve patients survives more than\n12 months (1-year survival rates: 10%–20%). Long-term survival\nhas been reported, but the estimated rate at 10 years is <5%. The\ndismal prognosis stems from the fact that over 40% of the\npatients present at diagnosis with large primary tumours (mean\nsize: 6 cm), gross extrathyroidal extension and locoregional and\ndistant metastases, which make complete resection unlikely\n[119]. A thorough imaging work-up should be carried out soon\nafter the diagnosis. The FDG–PET-CT scan is the most sensitive\ntool for documenting the extent of disease.

ATC is rarely amenable to complete resection (Figure 5).\nTotal thyroidectomy with bilateral central neck dissection may be\ncarried out in those very rare cases of localised ATC in M0\npatients. Extensive resection with total laryngectomy, oesopha-\ngectomy and/or resection of the great vessels has been reported in\nhighly selected cases in specialised centres, but postoperative\nmortality and morbidity are high and there is no high-level evi-\ndence to indicate that this approach improves survival. The prog-\nnosis is also unaffected by incomplete palliative resection (R2) or\n‘debulking’, which is not generally recommended [IV, E] [121].\nTracheostomy may be needed to alleviate symptoms in patients\nwith moderately progressive disease, but the impact of tracheos-\ntomy on QoL must be considered. Given the technical complex-\nity, the procedure is generally done under general anaesthesia. An\nexperienced team of surgeons and anaesthesiologists is essential,\nas is a complete preoperative cross-sectional imaging assessment\nof the trachea and tumour.\nRadiotherapy. Optimal outcomes in terms of survival and local\ndisease control in ATC require complete or near-complete [no\nresidual tumour (R0) or microscopic residual tumour (R1)] re-\nsection followed by high-dose EBRT, with or without concomi-\ntant ChT [V, A] [122, 123]. However, this multimodal approach\ncan strongly impact QoL and should be reserved for carefully\nselected patients to ensure clinical beneﬁt. Timely discussion\nwithin a multidisciplinary team setting is strongly recommended\n[V, A] (Figure 5).\nAnalysis of 1200 ATC cases in a large national database [121]\nrevealed signiﬁcantly better outcomes when multimodality\ntherapy included radical surgery (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.28–0.43,\nP < 0.0001 versus no surgery or palliative surgery), 40 Gy of\nEBRT (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38–0.56, P < 0.0001 versus no ERBT\nor <40 Gy EBRT) and ChT of any type (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52–\n0.76, P < 0.0001 versus no ChT). Outcomes also varied with\nUICC stage. For stage IVA disease, the beneﬁt from additional\ntherapies was nonsigniﬁcant. For stage IVB disease, however,\nradical surgery followed by both EBRT and ChT signiﬁcantly\nimproved cause-speciﬁc survival compared with radical sur-\ngery alone or with EBRT (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25–0.81,\nP ¼ 0.0083).\nA meta-analysis of 17 retrospective studies including 1147\npatients looked at the impact of postoperative radiotherapy\n(PORT) after radical ATC resection and found that it signiﬁcant-\nly reduced the risk of death as compared with radical resection\nalone (HR 0.556, 95% CI 0.419–0.737, P < 0.001) [124].\nExploratory analyses demonstrated that PORT might also confer\na survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IVA (HR 0.364,\nP ¼ 0.012) or IVB (HR 0.460, P ¼ 0.059) disease but not for stage\nIVC. For best outcomes, PORT must be delivered as soon as pos-\nsible after surgery [IV, A], but the patient must have recovered\nfrom surgery sufﬁciently to be able to lie ﬂat and tolerate\nimmobilisation.\nBecause of the improved dose distribution and the ability to re-\nduce toxicity, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (RT) is the rec-\nommended approach [IV, C] [125]. There is some evidence of a\ndose–response relation. Outcomes in ATC are improved with\ndoses exceeding 45–50 Gy [126, 127]. An analysis of the United\nStates National Cancer Database showed maximal beneﬁts with\ndoses >60 Gy [128]. Evidence that hyperfractionated accelerated\nRT (i.e. delivery of two or more fractions per day over a shorter\ntreatment time) improved survival over that obtained with con-\nventional fractionation is insufﬁcient, whereas it was clearly asso-\nciated with increased toxicity [129–131].\nFor stage IVA or IVB disease, concomitant ChT (usually with\ndoxorubicin or a platinum agent) has been used. Most of the data\nreported on this approach came from single-institution series\nand the clinical beneﬁts reported have been variable. It has been\nshown that concomitant taxane therapy has radio-sensitising\neffects [132].\nPalliative EBRT: In patients with unresectable disease, EBRT\nhas a role in symptom control [V, C] [133]. The aim is usually to re-\nduce the rate of growth of the neck mass and thereby the pressure\nsymptoms. Fractionation schedules vary according to the individual\npatient (most commonly from 20Gy in ﬁve fractions to 30 Gy in 10\nfractions). These fractionation regimens allow simple beam\narrangements such as parallel opposed or simple three-dimensional\nconformal techniques, so that RT can be started as soon as possible.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. Novel systemic\ntherapies are urgently needed to improve the generally poor out-\ncomes associated with ATC. Clinical trial enrolment should\ntherefore be encouraged for patients with good clinical PS [V, B].\nFor patients ineligible for systemic treatments or clinical trials,\nbest supportive care should be discussed (Figure 5) [133].\nTo date, cytotoxic ChT has been the primary treatment for\nmetastatic disease, but it is associated with very low response rates\nand signiﬁcant toxicities [133]. Recommended regimens consist\nof single-agent therapy with paclitaxel or doxorubicin or com-\nbined treatments (e.g. carboplatin/paclitaxel, docetaxel/doxo-\nrubicin) administered weekly or every 3–4 weeks [134–136]. No\ndata are available to guide decisions on second-line therapy\n[133]. Chemoradiotherapy can be considered for local control of\nunresectable stage IVB disease, ideally with weekly administra-\ntion of radio-sensitising ChT (see above).\nSeveral novel approaches (targeted therapy, immunother-\napy) are being studied, alone or in combination, to improve\nthe poor response rates achieved with current strategies. The ef-\nﬁcacy of lenvatinib in ATC is controversial. In 2015, the\ndrug was approved by the Japanese regulatory agency for treat-\nment of TCs, including ATC, based on data from a single-arm,\nopen-label, phase II study conducted on a population of 51\npatients [137], 17 of whom had ATC. The primary aim was to\nestablish the drug’s safety in this setting. The ATC patients had\nan mPFS of 7.4 months (95% CI 1.7–12.9), an mOS of\n10.6 months (95% CI 3.8–19.8) and an objective response rate\nof 24%. These ﬁndings prompted an international, multi-\ncentre, phase II trial, but the trial was stopped early due to futil-\nity (NCT02657369).\nMolecular proﬁling studies have begun to elucidate the mo-\nlecular drivers and the multistep dedifferentiation associated\nwith ATC tumourigenesis [21, 22]. Early mutation of BRAF and\nRAS has been reported in 25% and 28% of the cases, respectively\n[138]. In a phase II, open-label basket trial, patients with BRAF\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1871\n\n---\nV600E-positive malignancies (including 16 with ATC) were\ntreated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily)\nplus the MEK inhibitor trametinib (2 mg once daily). The ORR\nwas 69% (11/16; 95% CI 41%–89%), and the treatment was well\ntolerated [139]. In May 2018, this combination received FDA\napproval for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic\nATC with the BRAF V600E mutation. If available, this should be\nthe ﬁrst-line therapy for advanced BRAF V600E ATC patients\n[V, B]. Other rare mutations and genetic aberrations may also\nprove to be druggable, such as ALK translocations [21, 22].\nExtended molecular proﬁling of ATCs should be strongly\nencouraged as it may reveal promising possibilities for targeted\ntherapies.\nIn the presence of non-druggable mutations, targeting the tu-\nmour microenvironment or common cancer signalling pathways\nis an alternative approach. ATC immunoproﬁling has revealed\nhigh numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes in the tumour\nand tumour cell expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-\nL1) [138]. Immunotherapy with antibodies targeting pro-\ngrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor or PD-L1 has produced\nimpressive results in many malignancies, but few data are avail-\nable on their use in ATC. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody\nspartalizumab was tested in 41 heavily pre-treated patients with\nadvanced ATC, and responses were observed in 19.5%, opening\nthe road to the use of immunotherapy in ATC [140].\nInclusion of targeted therapy, immunotherapy, ChT and/or\nRT,\nadministered\nin\ncombination\nor\nsequentially,\nin\nmultidisciplinary ATC management regimens may improve pa-\ntient outcomes (NCT03181100).\nMTC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nMTC is morphologically heterogeneous and can mimic virtually\nall other primary thyroid tumours. Demonstration of calcitonin\n(Ctn) expression is mandatory for the diagnosis. Rare primary\nCtn-negative neuroendocrine carcinomas of the thyroid exist\nand must be distinguished from metastases from neuroendo-\ncrine neoplasms of the lung. In these cases, carcinoembryonic\nantigen (CEA) determination can be useful, being the only neck\ntumour expressing this marker. The preoperative diagnosis\ncan also be challenging in the absence of a consistent\nimmunophenotype.\nRET and RAS proto-oncogene mutations are detected in\n\u000590% of MTCs and are considered the predominant drivers of\nthese tumours [141]. RET mutations occur sporadically, as som-\natic events, or can be inherited as germline events associated with\nfamilial MTC or the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes\ntype 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B). A quarter of MTCs occur\nas part of an inherited syndrome, and germline RET mutations\nare present in up to 10% of the patients presenting with apparent-\nly sporadic MTCs.

Strong genotype–phenotype associations\naffecting age at onset (most MTCs occur either in childhood or\nearly adulthood) and tumour aggressiveness have been reported\nfor speciﬁc germline RET mutations. MTCs harbouring somatic\nRET mutations are also commonly associated with more aggres-\nsive behaviour than that of their wild-type RET counterparts. The\nvast majority (91.4%) of sporadic MTCs with distant metastases\nharbour such mutations, in most cases RET M918T (93.8%)\n[144]. There is currently no evidence supporting the value of rou-\ntine screening of MTC patients for somatic RET mutations.\nHowever, if treatment of advanced MTCs with selective RET\ninhibitors is planned, RET testing for somatic mutations is\nneeded to individualise therapy [III, C].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe UICC system is recommended for staging all MTC patients,\nbased on its utility in predicting disease-speciﬁc mortality [IV, A]\n[23]. The eighth edition of this system has introduced some im-\nportant changes in the criteria used for staging thyroid tumours,\nincluding MTCs. Extrathyroidal extension, for example, is now\nimportant only when it is macroscopically evident (pT3b) [23].\nIn the absence of gross extracapsular extension, the primary will\nbe staged solely on the basis of its size (pT1, pT2 or pT3a)\n(Table 2).\nCtn and CEA are valuable diagnostic, prognostic and predict-\nive markers for use with MTC. Their serum concentrations are\ndirectly related to the C-cell mass [145, 146]. Preoperative Ctn\nlevels correlate strongly with tumour diameter and postoperative\nCtn levels. They can also provide useful preoperative information\non the extent of the disease.

Serum Ctn levels exceeding\n500 pg/ml suggest distant metastatic disease and should be\nexplored with additional whole-body imaging procedures.\nSerum Ctn should be measured 60–90 days after thyroidectomy.\nPatients whose postoperative basal serum Ctn level is normal\n(<10 pg/ml) are considered ‘biochemically cured’ and have a 10-\nyear survival rate of 97.7%. However, 3% of patients with normal\nbasal serum Ctn levels following thyroidectomy experience bio-\nchemical recurrence within 7.5 years [143]. CEA is not a speciﬁc\nbiomarker for MTC, and serum assays are not informative for the\nearly diagnosis of MTC. However, they are useful for monitoring\nthe progression of clinically evident MTCs [IV, B] [148–150].\nDoubling times for postoperative serum Ctn and CEA levels\n(deﬁned as the interval of time in which the tumour markers lev-\nels have doubled) are established prognostic markers in MTC\n[IV, B] [148–150]. They are currently considered the best avail-\nable predictors of tumour behaviour, recurrence and cancer-\nrelated death. A Ctn doubling time exceeding 6 months is associ-\nated with 5- and 10-year survival rates of 92% and 37%, respect-\nively; shorter doubling times predict markedly worse survival\n(25% and 8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively) [148]. In patients\nwith poorly differentiated and aggressive MTCs, Ctn values may\nactually decrease over time, whereas CEA levels increase [151].\nDetails on the use of Ctn and CEA doubling times are available\nbelow in the ‘Follow-up, long-term implications and survivor-\nship’ section.\nManagement of local/locoregional disease\nSurgery. Preoperative screening for pheochromocytoma and\nhyperparathyroidism is highly recommended for all patients with\nMTC (except in those already known to have MEN2B) [IV, A]\n[142, 143]. Neck US should be carried out to identify regional\nmetastases; if sonographic (or clinical) ﬁndings are suspicious,\ncontrast-enhanced CT of the neck and chest is indicated. Work-\nup for distant metastases, including chest CT, liver and axial bone\nMRI and 6-ﬂuoro-(18F)-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA)-\nPET scan (if available), should be done if serum Ctn levels exceed\n500 pg/ml or clinical ﬁndings are suspicious. Neck dissection,\nwhen needed, should be done by surgeons with substantial ex-\nperience in TC surgery. The initial approach will depend on pre-\noperative serum Ctn levels and neck imaging ﬁndings (Figure 6)\n[IV, B]. The guidelines in the algorithm are based on retrospect-\nive cohort studies [147, 152]. The grade B recommendation is\nbased on the clinical beneﬁts of elective neck dissection in\npatients with serum Ctn levels <500 pg/ml, for whom surgery\nmay be curative.\nFor carriers of germline mutations, the recommended age for\nprophylactic total thyroidectomy depends on the type of muta-\ntion. Individuals with germline M918T mutations should under-\ngo total thyroidectomy within the ﬁrst year of life. For those with\na C634F or A883F mutation (also considered high risk), surgery\ncan be postponed until age 5 unless Ctn levels increase. Those\nwith other mutations should be monitored from age 5 on with\nCtn assays and neck US, and surgery should be done if Ctn levels\nincrease or if the parents request it [143].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nCtn and CEA monitoring should both be included in the early\nand long-term postoperative staging work-ups [IV, B] [150].\nSerial measurements allow the calculation of doubling times,\nwhich provide useful information as described above. Currently\navailable data indicate that Ctn doubling times should be based\non at least four consecutive measurements, preferably obtained\nover a 2-year period [IV, C] [142, 143]. All measurements must\nbe made by the same laboratory using the same assay. The ATA\nprovides an online calculator for rapid determination of doubling\ntimes from user-supplied series of serum Ctn or serum CEA levels\n[153]. Figure 7 summarises MTC management strategies guided\nby Ctn and CEA levels and doubling times. Clinically relevant dis-\nease sites are rarely detected in patients with Ctn levels <150 pg/\nml, but the likelihood of structural disease increases as Ctn and\nCEA levels rise.\nMultiple imaging modalities should be used to identify locore-\ngional and/or distant metastases [IV, B] [142, 143]. Contrast-\nenhanced whole-body (brain, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis)\nCT with ultra-thin reconstructions is sensitive and speciﬁc\nenough to allow one to estimate the burden of systemic disease\nand to assess and identify target lesions. Target and non-target\nlesions to assess are measured using RECIST v1.1 [94]. Contrast-\nenhanced MRI is more sensitive in identifying liver lesions, which\ncan be misdiagnosed on CT or US as benign cystic lesions. US is\nuseful for assessing neck lymph node involvement, although, as\nmentioned before, it sometimes provides inadequate visualisa-\ntion of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by bone\nor air. For these structures, CT and MRI are more sensitive, pro-\nvide greater morphological detail, and are recommended when\nsurgical interventions, EBRT or other locoregional ablative\napproaches are being planned. MRI is recommended for identify-\ning or excluding brain metastases. Bone scans in MTC patients\nare high in sensitivity but low in speciﬁcity. Whole-body\nbone MRI without contrast medium offers higher speciﬁcity,\nparticularly for osteoblastic lesions. Contrast enhancement is\nrecommended when extraosseous extension or compression\nof the spinal cord or other neurological structures is suspected.\nEndoscopic exploration of the upper digestive tract and\nairways is mandatory whenever there is a high suspicion of\ninﬁltration.\nAs indolent tumours, MTCs generally display low avidity for\nFDG, so FDG–PET–CT is not recommended for their staging,\nbut it can be useful for assessing advanced disease characterised\nby dedifferentiation and rapid progression [151]. FDOPA–PET\nhas high sensitivity and speciﬁcity in MTC [154, 155] and it can\nreveal unidentiﬁed metastases or small lesions, but cost and avail-\nability issues make it unsuitable. Gallium-68 (68Ga) somatostatin\nanalogue PET–CT is relatively insensitive and is not useful for\nstaging, but it does reﬂect expression of somatostatin receptors,\nwhich is useful information when the feasibility of radionuclide\ntherapy is being explored [156].\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1874 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nTable 7.

Disease behaviour varies widely—indolent\nin some cases, rapidly progressive in others—and can be reliably\npredicted by Ctn and CEA doubling times. Advanced MTCs are\ninvariably associated with the secretion of a variety of peptides\n(e.g. prostaglandins, kinins, vasoactive intestinal peptide, sero-\ntonin, histaminase), which can cause unpleasant symptoms such\nas ﬂushing and diarrhoea. Management of these symptoms\nshould be the ﬁrst goal of treatment.\nThe systemic therapies currently approved for MTC have not\nbeen shown to improve OS, so evidence-based guidance is lacking\non when to start these drugs and how patients with indolent\ndisease should be followed. Decisions are based mainly on clini-\ncians’ experience. Multidisciplinary input (e.g. from surgeons,\nendocrinologists, nuclear medicine physicians, medical and radi-\nation oncologists, pain therapists and palliative care specialists) is\nstrongly recommended to ensure optimal care for these patients.\nActive treatment (e.g. locoregional or systemic MKI administra-\ntion) should be considered in the presence of symptoms, lesions\nclose to vital structures, high-tumour burdens or disease progres-\nsion (as deﬁned by RECIST v1.1) [94].\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Cabozantinib [I, A] and vandetanib\n[I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] are the ﬁrst-line systemic treat-\nments for progressive metastatic MTC.

Both drugs inhibit RET kinase activity\nto some extent, and this was the major reason they were originally\nproposed for treating MTC patients. However, their antitumour\neffect is mainly due to their strong inhibition of key angiogenic\npathway components, including vascular endothelial growth fac-\ntor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2).\nThe ZETA trial compared vandetanib (300 mg daily) with pla-\ncebo (2 : 1) in 331 patients with symptomatic and/or metastatic\nMTC [158]. Radiological evidence of disease progression was not\nan enrolment requirement, and placebo-to-vandetanib crossover\nwas allowed if disease progression occurred. The predicted mPFS\nin the vandetanib arm was signiﬁcantly longer than that observed\nin the placebo group (30.5 versus 19.3 months; HR 0.46, 95% CI\n0.31–0.69, P < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the vandetanib\narm (45% versus 13% for placebo, OR 5.48, 95% CI 2.99–10.79,\nP < 0.001), and all but one of the responses in the placebo arm\nwere recorded after crossover to vandetanib. Radiological\nresponses\nwere\naccompanied\nby\nsigniﬁcant\nbiochemical\nresponses (reductions in Ctn and CEA levels in 69% and 52% of\ncases, respectively). Vandetanib exhibited activity independently\nof the tumour’s RET status, previous treatment, metastasis\nsite(s), disease progression status and tumour burden. When the\nZETA data were ﬁrst published, no survival advantage was\nreported for patients managed with vandetanib and no updates\nhave been published since then. In a phase I/II trial of vandetanib\nin children with MTC (two courses at 100 mg/day, then 150 mg/\nday), partial responses were seen in 47% patients, and the AE pro-\nﬁle resembled that observed in adults [160].\nIn the EXAM trial, cabozantinib (140 mg daily) was tested\nagainst placebo (2 : 1) in 330 patients with metastatic MTC [159].\nThe main inclusion criterion was disease progression within the\n14 months preceding study entry. Prior therapy, including MKIs,\nwas allowed, and crossover was not permitted. Compared with\nplacebo, cabozantinib was associated with a signiﬁcantly longer\nmPFS (11.2 versus 4.0 months, HR 0.28, 95% CI, 0.19–0.40,\nP < 0.001) and a higher rate of responses (all partial) (28% versus\n0%, median duration 14.7 months). Efﬁcacy was observed across\nall subgroups, regardless of age, tumour location, tumour bur-\nden, progression rate, prior kinase inhibitor treatment (in 20% of\npatients) or RET/RAS mutation status. mOS rates were similar in\nthe two arms (26.6 versus 21.1 months, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64–\n1.12, P ¼ 0.024), but in the subgroup with RETM918T-positive\nMTCs, cabozantinib was associated with signiﬁcantly longer sur-\nvival (44.3 versus 18.9 months with placebo, HR 0.60, 95% CI\n0.38–0.94, P ¼ 0.03). PFS was consistent with OS in the\nRETM918T-positive\ncases\n(HR\n0.15,\n95%\nCI\n0.08–0.28,\nP < 0.0001) [161].\nAlthough the ZETA and EXAM trials both focused on patients\nwith advanced and/or metastatic disease, their designs and inclu-\nsion criteria were different. The markedly longer mPFS in the pla-\ncebo arm of the ZETA trial—19.3 months [158] versus 4 months\nin EXAM [159]—suggests population differences. Indeed, unlike\nZETA participants, those enrolled in EXAM had to meet RECIST\ncriteria for disease progression and were thus likely to have more\nadvanced disease. The results of the two trials are therefore not\ncomparable, and there is no clear evidence supporting vandetanib\nover cabozantinib as ﬁrst-line treatment. Both are active in ﬁrst-\nand second-line regimens, both prolonged PFS compared with\nplacebo and both displayed RET/RAS status-independent efﬁ-\ncacy. The choice of which drug to use as ﬁrst-line treatment may\nbe based on potential toxicity in each patient (see below).\nHowever, cabozantinib, in a subgroup analysis, demonstrated a\nsigniﬁcant advantage in PFS and OS in patients with RETM918T\nor RAS-mutant MTCs [II, C] [161]. As noted for lenvatinib, re-\ncently released real world data on the efﬁcacy of vandetanib in\nMTC patients are somewhat less encouraging than those gener-\nated in the highly selected population of RCTs [162].\nOther anti-angiogenic MKIs (e.g. sorafenib, motesanib, pazo-\npanib, sunitinib, lenvatinib) have already undergone phase II\ntesting in advanced MTC patients. The most interesting results\nregarded sunitinib and lenvatinib, which were associated with\nresponse rates of 50% and 36%, respectively [157]. Thus far,\nhowever, no MKIs have been approved for second-line use. A\nrandomised trial assessing the efﬁcacy of nintedanib as second-\nline MKI therapy was prematurely closed due to ﬂat enrolment\n(NCT01788982). The more selective RET inhibitors (e.g.\nLOXO-292-NCT03157128,\nBLU-667-NCT03037385)\nappear\npromising and are now under investigation. The RET-\nsuppressing activity of these drugs is essential to their antitu-\nmour effects in MTC, whereas their anti-angiogenic activity is\nnegligible.\nManagement of side-effects: AEs are very common during MKI\ntherapy, and their management is critical for optimising these\ncompounds’ therapeutic ratios. In the ZETA trial, 35% of the\npatients in the vandetanib arm required dose reductions and 12%\ndiscontinued treatment due to toxicity [158]. The most common\nTable 9.

Corrected QT interval\n(QTc) prolongation was a severe, unexpected side-effect in 8% of\ncases. Attempts to reduce the rate of grade 2 or higher AEs with\nan active support programme (including patient contact/visit\nevery 2 weeks and supportive agents such as sunscreen and lo-\nperamide) have been unsuccessful [163]. AEs were also common\nin the EXAM trial, with grade 3 or 4 AEs in 69% of patients\nreceiving cabozantinib. The most common were diarrhoea\n(15.9%), hand–foot syndrome (12.6%) and fatigue (9.3%). Pre-\nexisting disease-related diarrhoea can be worsened by MKI ther-\napy (as a drug-related AE) or improved as a direct effect of the\ndrug’s activity. Increased TSH levels were reported in 57% of the\ncabozantinib-treated patients. TSH levels should be monitored\ncontinuously during treatment, as these patients are generally on\nhormone-replacement therapy if they have undergone total thy-\nroidectomy. Levels should be kept within the normal range: TSH\nsuppression produces no beneﬁts in patients with MTC (unlike\nthose with DTC). AEs associated with VEGF-pathway inhibition\n(e.g. hypertension, haemorrhage, ﬁstula formation, gastrointes-\ntinal\nperforation)\noccurred\nmore\nfrequently\namong\ncabozantinib-treated patients than in those treated with placebo.\nIn the EXAM trial, 79% of patients in the cabozantinib arm\nhad dose reductions, 65% interrupted treatment due to AEs, and\n16% stopped treatment because of toxicities. Randomised trials\nare underway to assess the activities of lower, potentially less\ntoxic doses of vandetanib (150 versus 300 mg, NCT01496313)\nand\ncabozantinib\n(140 mg\ncapsules\nversus\n60 mg\npills,\nNCT01896479).\nThe preliminary results comparing the effects of the two doses\nof vandetanib in patients with advanced MTC have been posted\non ClinicalTrials.gov and showed that the starting dose of 150 mg\nis equally effective as the high 300 mg dose in term of ORR.\nInterruption of treatment and dose reductions are the most\ncommon means for managing AEs. Most decrease in intensity\nafter a few days of withdrawal, but vandetanib AEs may be more\npersistent, given the drug’s 19-day half-life. However, frequent\ninterruptions might reduce the efﬁcacy of MKIs and/or trigger\ncertain escape mechanisms. Most AEs (e.g. hypertension, diar-\nrhoea) are well known and preventable. Useful guidelines for pre-\nventing and managing treatment-related AEs in these complex\ncases have been published by several societies. As for fertility pres-\nervation, the same measures taken for DTC patients are valid for\nthose with MTC.\nConventional\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nradionuclide\ntherapy:\nSystemically administered ChT has historically yielded poor\nresults in MTC. The available data have been generated by retro-\nspective analyses of small, single-institution cases series. The\nmost active drugs have been doxorubicin alone or combined with\ncisplatin, which achieved a response in around 20% at best, or as\na combination with 5-ﬂuorouracil and dacarbazine which did\nnot result in much greater responses [157].\nRadionuclide therapy is an option in selected cases [III, C]. The\nactivity of yttrium-90–DOTA-[D-Phe1-Tyr3]-octreotide (90Y-\nDOTATOC) was tested in a phase II trial including 31 patients\nwith metastatic MTC and increasing Ctn levels. Post-treatment\ndecreases in Ctn levels (the primary endpoint) occurred in 29%\nof the patients treated, and survival beneﬁts were also observed in\nthe responders [164]. RCTs have not been carried out to compare\nthe efﬁcacies of radionuclide and MKI therapies. Ideally, this\ncomparison should be done within a clinical trial setting. In short,\nthere is little evidence to support the use of either ChT or radio-\nnuclide therapy in patients with MTC, although either might be\nconsidered when MKIs are contraindicated.\nMethodology\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in accordance\nwith the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical\nPractice\nGuidelines\ndevelopment,\nhttp://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology. The relevant litera-\nture has been selected by the expert authors. A summary of rec-\nommendations is provided in Table 7. An ESMO-MCBS table\nwith MCBS scores is included in Table 8. ESMO-MCBS v1.1 was\nused to calculate scores for new therapies/indications approved\nby the EMA since 1 January 2016. [165]. Levels of evidence and\ngrades of recommendation have been applied using the system\nshown in Table 9 [166]. Statements without grading were consid-\nered justiﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts and the\nESMO faculty.

Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may\nsecrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF\nto functional status.10\nRecommendation\n\u0002 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,\ngrading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and\nsynaptophysin should be reported.

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs. FDG is the tracer of choice\nfor G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose\nmetabolism and less SSTR expression than the low-grade\nNETs, for which the situation is usually the reverse.29 Com-\nbined SSTR imaging and FDG-PET-CT has been shown to be\ncomplementary for lesion detection. Findings of FDG-\npositive NETs at PET-CT indicate worse prognosis.29e31\nThe author panel believes that optimal diagnostic and\nprognostic information can be achieved by submitting all\nNET G2/G3 patients to PET-CT with both FDG and 68Ga-\nTable 3.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic\nradical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph\nnodes can be achieved in \u000480% of cases if carried out by\nexperienced surgeons.40\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locore-\ngional\ndisease\nin\nNET\nG1\nand\nG2.\nBefore\nany\nFigure 2.

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].

However, in aggressive NENs (NEC\nG3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy\n(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are\nwarranted.\nMedical therapy\nThe goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-\nassociated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].\nTreatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-\ntide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning\nNETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved\nin 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations\n[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT.

SSAs are an established anti-\nproliferative therapy in metastatic GEP-NETs, based on two\nplacebo-controlled trials. Most frequently, they are used in\nﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the\nsettings in which they have been studied. Overall response\nrates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset. The\nmedian progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached\nwith lanreotide (>27 months) and was 18 months in the\nplacebo arm.59 The CLARINET extension study also showed\nefﬁcacy in\nprogressive\ndisease\npatients with\nentero-\npancreatic NETs.60 There is very good long-term tolerability\nof both SSAs.47,58,59 SSAs can be recommended for tumour\ngrowth control in advanced SSTR-positive, slowly-growing\nGI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I, A; European Society\nfor Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A; ESMO-\nMCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48]. There was a beneﬁt in terms of PFS prolon-\ngation in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56 (0.37e0.8)] and the\nlung NET subgroup [HR 0.5 (0.28e0.88)], and everolimus is\nEMA-approved for NF-GI and lung NETs. Everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive GI NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%).

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4. Systemic therapy in GEP-NENs.\nThe stratiﬁcation factors are not predictive, but prognostic.\nA watch-and-wait approach is recommended in asymptomatic low-grade tumour patients with absence of morphological progression. Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

The NETTER-2 trial has recently been\ninitiated to address this issue (NCT03972488).\nTreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE is in general considered\nsafe, however, up to 3%e4% of the patients may develop\nirreversible bone marrow toxicity such as leukaemia or bone\nmarrow dysplasia.

There is\nno established second-line therapy, but different\nregimens [e.g. 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI),\n5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin\n(FOLFOX),\nCAPTEM\n\u0006\nbevacizumab] may be considered [IV, B].\n\u0002 In NET G3, response rates to cisplatin/etoposide are\nlow, and the use of this combination is not recommen-\nded [IV, C].\n\u0002 ChT cannot be recommended in well-differentiated\nslowly growing NETs of the GI tract [II, C]; exceptions\nmay be rapidly progressive tumours or NET G2 with\nhigher Ki-67 close to NET G3 [V, C].\n\u0002 PRRT is recommended as second-line therapy in patients\nwith midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs who\nfulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT [I, A].\n\u0002 177Lu-DOTATATE is EMA- and FDA-approved for patients\nwith midgut NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] and\nPan-NETs [III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4].\n\u0002 In Pan-NETs, PRRT should be used after failure of\napproved therapies [III, A].\n\u0002 In carefully selected patients, PRRT may be considered in\nNET G3 [IV, C].\n\u0002 SSA should be combined with PRRT in patients with\nfunctioning tumours (CS) to prevent increasing symp-\ntoms such as diarrhoea and/or ﬂushing and hormonal\ncrisis soon after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 It is also common practice to continue SSA beyond PRRT\nin functioning tumours, as a full resolution of CS-related\nsymptoms is rarely achieved after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 The combination of SSA with PRRT is not recommended\nin patients with NF-NETs, [IV, C] and it remains unclear if\nSSA should be continued after PRRT as a maintenance\ntherapy.\nPERSONALISED MEDICINE\nIn the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity of\ncomparative\nrandomised\ntrials,\ntherapy\nselection\nin\nadvanced non-resectable disease is frequently based on\nindividual patient clinical and pathological features and\nSSTR imaging [IV, A]. Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence. NSE and\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be monitored in NEC;\nAnnals of Oncology\nM. Pavel et al.\n856\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.304\nVolume 31\n- Issue 7\n- 2020\n\n---\nCgA may also be elevated in NET G3. Conventional imaging\nincludes thoracic and abdominal scans every 2e3 months.\nFDG-PET may be required in case of suspected recurrence to\ndiscriminate lesions from unspeciﬁc ﬁndings; otherwise,\nhigh-resolution CT is the imaging method of choice, unless\nresection is considered in locally advanced NEN G3,\nwhere FDG-PET is mandatory to exclude distant metastatic\ndisease.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional\nand SSTR imaging [V, B].\n\u0002 In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1eG2, it is recom-\nmended that imaging is carried out every 3e6 months\n(CT or MRI), and in NEC G3 every 2e3 months [V, C].\nSimilar staging intervals apply to advanced disease.\n\u0002 Follow-up should be lifelong, although the staging inter-\nvals may be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up.\n\u0002 Small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix or rectum do not need any follow-up if\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in\naccordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures\nfor Clinical Practice Guidelines development, http://www.\nesmo.org/Guidelines/ESMOGuidelines-Methodology.\nThe\nrelevant literature has been selected by the expert authors.\nAn ESMO-MCBS table with ESMO-MCBS scores is included\nin supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.107 Levels of evidence and grades of recommenda-\ntion have been applied using the system shown in\nsupplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.108 Statements without grading were considered\njustiﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts and the\nESMO Faculty.

Patients with carcinoids are generally\nyounger, have a better prognosis and do not have a strong\nassociation with smoking, as compared with SCLC and\nLCNEC.1 The incidence of LC is very low, ranging from 0.2-2/\n100 000 persons/year in both the United States and\nEurope.2,3 Numbers are increasing, likely due to increased\nawareness and improved diagnostic techniques, although it\nmay also be a genuine overall increase in incidence.2,3 LCs\naccount for 20%-25% of all NETs and 1%-2% of all lung\ncancers. LCs prevail slightly more often in women than in\nmen. LCs occur during the ﬁfth or sixth decade of life for TC\nand a decade later for AC.4-10\nThC is an extremely rare tumour accounting for an age-\nadjusted rate of 0.02/100 000-0.18/100 000/year in the\nEuropean or USA populations, respectively.3,11 In the\nNetherlands cancer registry or the Surveillance, Epidemi-\nology and End Results (SEER) programme database, <0.5%\nof all neuroendocrine neoplasms were ThC, representing 5%\nof thymic tumours.3,11 The incidence of ThC is increasing in\nthe USA population.11 ThC prevails in men and the mean\nage at diagnosis is 55 years.1,11-13\nLC and ThC may also be present in multiple endocrine\nneoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome or when there is a\nfamily history of carcinoid tumours or diffuse pulmonary\nneuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) (Supplementary\nMaterial,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2021.01.003).1,14-17\nRecommendation\n\u0001 The scarcity of LCs and ThCs justiﬁes the therapeutic\nmanagement of these patients by expert multidisci-\nplinary teams in centres grouped within networks (na-\ntional or European networks) for care and research\noptimisation [V, A].\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nLC is revealed by non-speciﬁc tumour-related respiratory\nsymptoms (mainly, central forms) or incidentally (mainly,\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Note: Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last\nupdate December 2020.

A minority of cases present with symp-\ntoms related to hormonal hypersecretion, including carci-\nnoid syndrome (CS), due to serotonin and other compound\nsecretions, Cushing’s syndrome (CuS), due to adrenocorti-\ncotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion and acromegaly, due to\ngrowth\nhormone-releasing\nhormone\n(GHRH)\nsecre-\ntion.5,7,18,19 In a recent large population-based study series\nof 3002 LC patients, CS was present in 229 patients (7.6%)\nat diagnosis.20\nDiagnosis is carried out with bronchoscopic technique,\ntransthoracic biopsy or, less frequently, by mediastinoscopy\nor\nendobronchial\nendoscopic\nultrasonography\n(EBUS)\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).\nSurgery may be carried out upfront after adequate\nmedical\npreparation\nin\nlocalised\nresectable\ntumours\nresembling LCs or in tumours considered at high risk of\nbleeding or hormonal crisis or when previous biopsy has\nfailed. Once the diagnosis is suspected, standardised char-\nacterisation of LC comprises several speciﬁc steps for eval-\nuation that are described in Table 1 [III, B].4-9,18,20-34\nThC is revealed by tumour-related symptoms, or due to\nfunctionally active tumours or by chance.11-13 Diagnostic\nprocedures, including core biopsy under ultrasonography\nguidance, or preferably through a thoracic computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) scan, or upfront surgery following the guidelines for\nthymic tumour diagnosis, should be carried out.35 The authors\nrecommend standardised characterisation of ThC in multidis-\nciplinary expert centres as described in Table 1 [III, B].11,12,32-37\nThe histopathological diagnosis of LC or ThC relies on\ncharacteristic morphological features and on the demon-\nstration of the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour through\nthe immunodetection of a panel of markers including at least\nchromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin, which are usually\nexpressed in all carcinoids. This might be expanded to other\nmarkers such as CD56.1 Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1)\nmay be useful in well-differentiated tumours only, when\npositive, to suggest the lung origin of metastatic tumours.1\nTCs and ACs are distinguished (Supplementary Table S1,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003),\non the basis of mitotic count and presence or absence of\nnecrosis.1 While Ki-67 index is not included in the WHO\ncriteria, the WHO acknowledges that Ki-67 index might be\nuseful for the differential diagnosis between well- or poorly-\ndifferentiated NETs (Supplementary Table S1, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).1 Carcinoids\nare characterised by mutations involving either MEN-1 or\nother genes encoding chromatin-remodelling proteins.38,39\nTP53 and particularly RB1 gene alterations, which are rare\nmolecular events in carcinoids, might be potential tools to\ndiscriminate between well or poorly differentiated categories\nin difﬁcult cases like the recently identiﬁed LC with high\nproliferative features. This new subgroup is deﬁned by a\nmitotic count >10 and/or a Ki-67 index >20%, and a well-\ndifferentiated morphology (Supplementary Table S2, avail-\nable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).39-43\nThe ratio between TC and AC is about 6 : 10 in surgical se-\nries but may be closer to 1 : 1 in advanced cases.1,4,6,7,20\nThe ThC WHO classiﬁcation is identical to that of lung\nNETs with four categories including TC or AC deﬁned using\nthe same criteria (Supplementary Table S1, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003). The pattern\nof genetic alterations is different from LC.1,38 As for LCs, a\nsubgroup of ThC with high proliferative features has\nrecently been recognised.44 The ratio between atypical and\ntypical ThC is about 2 : 1.1,33,34,36\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Management of LC and ThC requires a multidisciplinary\nstandardised approach in specialised centres [IV, A]\n\u0001 Ki-67 (MIB 1) [IV, A], TTF1 [IV, B], p53/RB1 [IV, B]\nbiomarker analyses are recommended in selected cases\nfor differential diagnosis or site of origin orientation.\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nRisk assessments depend on pathology and TNM (tumoure\nnodeemetastasis) staging based on the combination of\nTable 1.

The diversity\nof metastatic sites and the potential overestimation of lung\nmetastasis and underestimation of brain metastasis must be\ntaken into account.46,47 The WHO classiﬁcation and patho-\nlogical TNM (pTNM) staging are intricate.5,21,48 In a recent\nstudy in which patients underwent \u000310 lymph node\nresection, frequency of positive lymph nodes was 17%\n(including 6% N2-N3) or 46% (including 23% N2-N3) in case\nof TC or AC, respectively.48\nMost ThCs are diagnosed at advanced-stage Masaokae\nKoga (Supplementary Table S5, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) or TNM stage III or\nIV.11,12,32 The most common sites for metastases include the\npleura, pericardium, bone, lung and liver.\nIn LCs, overall survival (OS) is mainly inﬂuenced by WHO\npathology and the pTNM classiﬁcations.1,5,21,45-49 In stage I,\nII, III or IV LC patients, 10-year disease-speciﬁc survival is\n96%, 85%, 81%, 59% and 88%, 75%, 47%, 18%, in TC or AC,\nrespectively, showing the major prognostic inﬂuence of the\nWHO classiﬁcation.46\nAfter resection, WHO classiﬁcation and pathological lymph\nnode staging (pN) status constitute the two main prognostic\nparameters (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).4,5,9,21,45,48-51\nAlthough\nKi-67 index is considered a promising prognostic marker by\nthe whole author panel, its technique of evaluation and the\nmost accurate thresholds remain a matter of debate; more-\nover, no deﬁnitive validation of its added value to WHO and\npTNM classiﬁcations has been provided so far in large series\nof LCs.18,28,45,52,53 At the metastatic stage, WHO classiﬁcation,\nperformance status, CgA levels, tumour burden and so-\nmatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) uptake, as well as tumour\ngrowth slope and the functioning syndrome, should be taken\ninto account for adequate risk assessment [IV, B].47 Prolonged\nsurvival of the majority of patients with LCs (including a 60%\n5-year OS for metastatic LC) makes adjusted toxicity proﬁle of\ntherapeutic interventions critical [V, A].47\nThe prognosis of patients with thymic NETs remains poor:\nin retrospective series, 5- or 10-year OS was 28%-72% or\n26%-60%, respectively.11-14,33 Based on a few large, retro-\nspective thymic NETs series, OS is inﬂuenced by stage,\nmainly\ntumour\nsize\nand\ncompleteness\nof\nresection\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).11-13,32,33,36 No speciﬁc staging\nsystem has yet been validated for ThC. The authors there-\nfore recommend the use of both staging systems (TNM,\nMasaokaeKoga) together with the WHO classiﬁcation and\nresection status for adequate prognostic stratiﬁcation.1\nRecommendations\n\u0001 WHO and pTNM classiﬁcations constitute the basis of\nthe prognostic classiﬁcation [II, B]\n\u0001 i.v. contrast-enhanced cross-sectional conventional imag-\ning including liver late arterial phase and PET-CT with\n68Ga-labelled SSAs constitute the basis of TNM evalua-\ntion [II, B]\n\u0001 Speciﬁc prognostic factors including tumour growth rate\nor presence of functioning syndromes are taken into ac-\ncount in advanced-stage LCs and ThCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Prolonged survival of most patients with LCs makes\nadjusted toxicity proﬁle of therapeutic interventions crit-\nical [V, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE,\nLOCAL RECURRENCE AND ADJUVANT THERAPY\nLocal/locoregional disease treatment\nControl of a functioning syndrome must be considered\nbefore any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]. Surgery\nrepresents the treatment of choice for LCs (both TCs and\nACs), even in the case of N2 lymph nodal metastases [IV,\nA].54 The surgical approach depends on tumour size, loca-\ntion and preoperative biopsy specimen assessment. The\nchoice of open surgery or minimally invasive approaches\nwill depend on the experience of the surgeon. Patients with\nsmall peripheral nodules may be candidates for minimally\ninvasive access including lung resection and lymph node\ndissection (usually a video-assisted lobectomy/segmentec-\ntomy). The surgical access for centrally located tumours,\nthose with suspected/proven metastatic lymph nodes,\nusually requires thoracotomy, depending on the surgeon’s\nexpertise.\nAnatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy,\nlobectomy,\nbilobectomy,\npneumonectomy)\nand\nlymph\nnode resection (with a minimum of six nodal stations:\nthree hilar and three mediastinaldalso including subcarinal\nstationdas recommended by the European Society of\nThoracic Surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer) is the\npreferred extent of resection [IV, B]. Indeed, wedge resec-\ntion may increase the risk of tumour recurrences, especially\nin N-positive TC or intermediate-grade ACs.4,5,55,56 In ACs,\nE. Baudin et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 32\n- Issue 4\n- 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003\n441\n\n---\nbut also in N-positive TCs, lobectomy is reported as superior\nto segmentectomy in terms of OS in some, but not\nall.5,7,8,18,51,54,55,57,58 Bronchoplastic procedures (e.g. sleeve\nresections) are preferred for suitable centrally located tu-\nmours, with the aim of avoiding pneumonectomy [IV B].\nTransfer of patients to specialist centres for sleeve resection\nshould be discussed [IV, B]. Frozen sections of bronchial and\nvascular margins are recommended to rule out tumour\ninvolvement of resection margins, a condition that conse-\nquently imposes a greater pulmonary resection. Systematic\nlymph node dissection is recommended as lymph node\nmetastases may be observed in up to 27% of TCs and in up\nto 47% of ACs, and lymph node resection inﬂuences the\nprognosis and the modality of follow-up5,45,48,49,56 [IV, B].\nR0 resection is achieved in >85% of cases.7,10\nIn case of distal lung parenchyma destruction, there is an\noption for endobronchial resection to relieve the obstruc-\ntion, followed by reassessment and deﬁnitive surgery a few\nweeks later.\nWatchful radiological follow-up, as an alternative to\nsurgery, may be considered in case of cT1N0 carcinoid\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH, but also in MEN-1 patients\nand patients with comorbid conditions, due to the indo-\nlent course of most tumours [IV, C]. Rarely, carcinoids\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH may progress and be\nconsidered\nfor\nsublobar\nresection\n(including\nwedge\nresection), especially in case of large tumour size and/or\npresence of lymph nodes and/or uncontrolled functioning\nsyndrome, as a potential alternative to anatomical surgery\nin these patients to preserve lung function; medical op-\ntions (SSAs) or nonsurgical locoregional therapeutic pro-\ncedures may also constitute potential alternatives to be\ndiscussed case by case [V, C].14,17,24 Patients with non-\nDIPNECH or non-MEN-1 multifocal LC primaries may\nconstitute a distinct entity which may beneﬁt from a\nsimilar management [V, C].59\nUpfront surgery can be offered for all ThCs deemed\nradically resectable [IV, B]. Resectability judgement is\nmostly based on the surgeon’s expertise in thymic surgery.\nProspective registration of these cases is recommended.\nMedian sternotomy is the standard surgical approach and\nless invasive forms of access (video-assisted, robotic-\nassisted) are currently being investigated; in selected\ncases (tumours invasive to the lung, great vessels or with\npleural/pericardial implants), a combined approach (ster-\nnotomy plus anterior thoracotomy) or a thoracotomy are\nrequired to achieve a complete tumour resection. Palliative\nsurgery is not recommended. Lymphadenectomy has his-\ntorically rarely been carried out at the time of resection of\nthymic tumours; however, the latest UICC TNM staging\nsystem recommends that locoregional lymph nodal dissec-\ntion should be carried out also during ThC resection.60 Due\nto the poor prognosis of ThC, prophylactic thymectomy\ncould be discussed in young male adult patients with MEN-\n1 at the time of initial or recurrent parathyroidectomy,\nespecially in families with aggressive thymic tumours [V,\nC];14,15,61\nthe\nbest\nsurgical\napproach\nmay\ninclude\ncervicotomy and upper sternal split or other surgical pro-\ncedures to avoid incomplete thymic resection.\nLocal recurrence therapy\nAfter a median follow-up of 54-121 months, recurrences\noccur in up to 7% of TCs and up to 35% of ACs.4,7,18,53,54\nOne-third are local recurrences.\nIn case of local recurrence, surgical resection with radical\nintent is recommended when technically feasible. In patients\nwith signiﬁcant comorbidity or high operative risk, palliative\nlocoregional procedures or watchful follow-up may constitute\nan alternative (Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).54,62\nAdjuvant therapy\nLarge retrospective studies have reported no beneﬁt of\nadjuvant therapy in both TCs and ACs.5,8-10,18 Therefore, the\nauthors do not recommend routine adjuvant therapy in LCs,\n[IV, D] for TC; [IV, C] for AC (Figure 1). However, it may be\nconsidered in selected ﬁt patients with particularly high risk\nof relapse (i.e. AC N2) after multidisciplinary discussion [IV,\nC]. We recommend prospective registration of these cases.\nMedical options, mainly cytotoxic chemotherapy (ChT) [plus\nor minus radiotherapy (RT)], cited in these guidelines,\nshould be considered ﬁrst.\nAvailable literature suggests no beneﬁt from adjuvant\ntherapy in ThCs [V, C].11-13,32 The majority of the author\npanel suggests individually discussing postoperative thera-\npies, including RT and/or systemic therapies (with options\ndiscussed in these guidelines), with patients with advanced-\nstage R0 or R1-2 resection [V, C] (Figure 2).\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Control of a functioning syndrome must be considered\nbefore any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]\n\u0001 An anatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy,\nlobectomy, bilobectomy) or bronchoplastic procedures\n(e.g. sleeve resections) together with lymph node dissec-\ntion are recommended in localised LCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Patients with cT1N0 LC within the setting of DIPNECH or\nMEN-1 syndromes, or with comorbid conditions, may\nbeneﬁt from an initial radiological follow-up without\ntreatment to determine the growth rate.

The most\nfrequent functioning syndrome is CS in LC, which requires\nannual echocardiography screening for carcinoid heart dis-\nease, when present or in case of increased 5-HIAA levels [V,\nC].60 In addition, prospective studies are expected to deter-\nmine the added value of N-terminal pro hormone B-type\nnatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the detection of carcinoid\nheart disease. In contrast, CS is rare in ThC. Based on\napproval and recommendations in gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NET patients with CS, we recommend long-acting SSAs\nas ﬁrst-line symptomatic treatment of CS [V, B].61,63-65 SSAs\nare also an option in DIPNECH patients presenting with res-\npiratory symptoms.65 Among second-line options described\nin Figure 3 and Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003,64-71\nonly\ntelotristat\nethyl has been approved by the European Medicines Agency\n(EMA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) for the treatment of the diarrhoea of refractory CS.

Palliative surgery\nor radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation or endo-\nbronchial treatment (EBT) of the primary tumour are oc-\ncasionally considered in cases of advanced disease at risk of\nlocal events or refractory CS [V, B]. More frequently, liver,\nbone and lung metastases represent potential targets for\nsuch strategies with the triple objectives of reducing the\nlocoregional risks, the primary tumour and the secretory\nburden (Figures 3 and 4). Such multiple locoregional man-\nagement may represent the only anti-tumour strategy in\npatients with slowly progressive tumours (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) [V, B].67,68,73-75\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Palliative surgery or locoregional procedures (RFA, cryoa-\nblation, EBT) of the primary tumour are occasionally\nconsidered in cases of advanced disease at risk of local\nevents or refractory CS [V, B]\n\u0001 Multiple locoregional therapies including surgery, com-\nbined or not with SSAs, are recommended to decrease\nthe tumour burden, to control hormonal secretions\nand to prevent local complications, as a ﬁrst-line thera-\npeutic approach in patients with advanced slowly pro-\ngressing LC [V, B].\nSystemic anti-tumour therapy\nSystemic anti-tumour therapies of patients with advanced\nLC are various, including SSAs, ChT, everolimus, peptide\nreceptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and interferon-a (IFN-\na) (Figure 4). These systemic therapies should be discussed\nwithin expert multidisciplinary teams for patients with\nmorphologically progressive tumours, high tumour burden\nor refractory functioning syndromes. No speciﬁc phase III\ntrial for LC exclusively has been published so far, therefore\nevidence comes mostly from retrospective analyses, less\nfrom phase II, single-arm trials, and sporadically from\nrandomised phase II or subgroups of phase III trials that\nenrolled a majority of GEP-NET patients. Everolimus is the\nonly treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA for LC.\nBased on the very limited data available in advanced ThC,\nwe recommend applying the same strategy as for LC.\nSSAs\nOctreotide [long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg] and lanreotide\n(120 mg) are the two SSAs most commonly used in clinical\npractice. Both showed antiproliferative activity and gains in\ntime to progression or progression-free survival (PFS) in\nplacebo-controlled, phase III trials enrolling good prognostic\nor\nslowly\nprogressive\nGEP-NETs,64\nwhere\nthey\nwere\napproved by the FDA and EMA for antiproliferative pur-\nposes. The placebo-controlled, randomised phase III trial,\nwhich evaluated lanreotide 120 mg in advanced LC, was\nstopped\nfor\ninsufﬁcient\nenrolment\n(SPINET\ntrial\nNCT02683941). Therefore, the feasibility of phase III trials in\nLC remains an issue. Two dedicated retrospective case series\nreported potential positive impact of SSAs, with a PFS of 17\nand 11 months, respectively.76,77 In the single, published,\nrandomised phase II LUNA trial, pasireotide 60 mg every 4\nweeks, in ﬁrst or second line after standard SSA therapy,\nachieved a 39% progression-free rate (PFR) at 9 months, in\na series of 41 LCs or ThCs with Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumours (RECIST) progression before enrolment\n(LUNA study). The PFR was not signiﬁcantly different from\nthat achieved with everolimus alone.20 On this basis, the\nauthors recommend SSA, for its better tolerability, as ﬁrst-\nline therapy in TC or slowly progressing somatostatin re-\nceptor (SSTR)-positive LC [IV, C].\nTargeted therapies\nEverolimus has been investigated in several clinical trials\nwhich included metastatic LCs and is currently the most\nstudied agent in LC. The RADIANT-4 study represents the\nlargest series of LCs ever included in a phase III trial\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10\n.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).78,79 Based on these results,\nthe FDA and EMA approved everolimus in advanced, pro-\ngressing, non-functional pulmonary and digestive NETs in\n2016. Furthermore, in the RADIANT-4 trial, everolimus\ndelayed\ntumour\nprogression\nwhile\npreserving\noverall\nhealth-related QoL.80 Everolimus has been reported to be\npotentially effective also in a post hoc analysis of the\nRADIANT-2 trial regarding a subgroup of LC associated with\na history of CS (Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).71,81\nEver-\nolimus is considered as ﬁrst-line therapy in the majority of\nACs or following progression to SSA for both TC and AC\npatients [II, B] (see Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003 for detailed\nLUNA trial data).\nE.

Only in the absence of ongoing trials to which\npatients could be recruited, PRRT is discussed as a potential\nalternative third-line or fourth-line therapy in patients with\nall RECIST-evaluable tumour deposits showing a positive\nuptake on SRI after SSA and everolimus, if available [IV, B].\nIFN-a and immunotherapy\nIn one dedicated study, IFN-a treatment resulted in stabi-\nlisation of tumour growth in 14% of patients.66 Two\nCarcinoid syndrome\nSlowly\nprogressive carcinoids\nSigniﬁ cantly \nprogressive carcinoids\nCushing syndrome\nFunctioning syndrome\nSSAs [V, B]\nLocoregional therapies/surgery\nTelotristat ethyla\nIncrease SSA dose\nPasireotide\nIFN-α\nMitotane\nOsilodrostat\nMifepristone\nEtomidate\nSSAs\nAntitumour systemic options\nPRRT\nEverolimus\nChT\nBilateral adrenalectomy\n[IV, B]\nSteroid synthesis inhibitors\n(metyrapone, ketoconazole) \n[IV, B]\nFigure 4.

Best sequence remains unknown.\nAC, atypical carcinoid; ChT, chemotherapy; IFN-a, interferon-a; LC, lung carcinoid; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, Response Evaluation Criteria in\nSolid Tumours; SRI, somatostatin receptor imaging; SSA, somatostatin analogue; TC, typical carcinoid; ThC, thymic carcinoid.\na Similar strategies are discussed in unresectable localised lung or thymic carcinoids.\nb Including high-grade atypical carcinoids.\nc Everolimus has the most solid evidence of efﬁcacy available and is the only approved treatment.\nd We recommend alkylating-based ChT as ﬁrst-line ChT and platinum-based ChT (oxaliplatin-based ChT is favoured by the panel) as second-line ChT in advanced LC\npatients refractory or intolerant to everolimus therapy [IV, C]. In few cases, with high proliferative ACs (Ki-67 >20%) or rapid growth, platinum-based ChT might be\nconsidered upfront (alternatives or second lines include everolimus or PRRT, based on SRI results).\ne PRRT should be considered as an alternative to ChT in selected patients (refractory carcinoid syndrome, SRI homogenous positive tumour uptake on all RECIST-\nevaluable targets). PRRT may be considered ﬁrst line in a few SRI-positive patients with refractory carcinoid syndrome and progressing or bulky tumours.\nf IFN-a should be considered as alternative to ChT especially if refractory carcinoid syndrome. The development of LC- and ThC-dedicated protocols is strongly\nencouraged.\nE.

Although the preclinical rationale is weak, immu-\nnotherapy is currently being evaluated in NETs with several\nactive trials (Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003)99 and no conclu-\nsion can be drawn yet.\nHigh proliferative LC\nBased on available data in digestive NETs (GEP-NET G3 sub-\ngroup) but also preliminary data in high proliferative LC, the\nauthors recommend treating these patients like they have\naggressive AC and not poorly differentiated carcinomas.42,100\nEverolimus, ChT and, in selected patients, PRRT, constitute the\nrecommended options in this rare subgroup of patients [V C].\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Systemic options should be discussed in an interdisci-\nplinary setting in patients with advanced carcinoids\nwith bulky tumour or progressing tumours at morpho-\nlogical imaging\n\u0001 SSAs are recommended ﬁrst-line treatment in patients\nwith\nTC\nand/or\nslowly\nprogressing\nadvanced\nSRI-\npositive LC and ThC [IV, C]\n\u0001 Everolimus is recommended either as ﬁrst line in case of\nAC or, second-line post-SSA, in patients with TC and or\nprogressive advanced LCs and ThCs [II, B]\n\u0001 Dacarbazine/temozolomide-based ChT as ﬁrst line, and\nplatinum-based ChT as second line, are recommended\nin advanced LC patients refractory or intolerant to ever-\nolimus therapy [IV, C]\n\u0001 PRRT (based on positive uptake at SRI on all RECIST-\nevaluable targets) as alternative second-line (in case of\nuncontrolled CS) or mainly third-line therapy (beyond\nSSAs and or everolimus) in morphologically progressive\nor high tumour burden advanced LC and ThCs is recom-\nmended [IV, B]\n\u0001 IFN-a as a potential second-line (in case of uncontrolled\nCS) or mainly third-line alternative (beyond SSAs and or\neverolimus) is recommended in morphologically progres-\nsive or high tumour burden advanced LC and ThCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Upfront everolimus or dacarbazine/temozolomide-based\nor oxaliplatin-based ChT is recommended, or in selected\nsubgroup PRRT (based on positive uptake at SRI on all\nRECIST-evaluable targets) in high proliferative ACs [V, C]\n\u0001 Since there is limited evidence of efﬁcacy for all treat-\nment options, clinical trials should be prioritised.\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up for LCs should be life-long, since recurrences\nremain very common over time [IV, C].4,7,18,50,51,101-103 Rec-\nommendations for follow-up are given in Supplementary\nMaterial and Supplementary Table S6, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003.\nThymic NET recurrences may be local (if located in the\nanterior mediastinum), regional (intrathoracic especially\npleural) or distant (Supplementary Material, available\nat https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).

It affects predominantly older,\nfair-skinned Caucasians and exhibits aggressive behaviour\nwith a high recurrence rate and a propensity for early\nmetastasis.1 Despite new advances in therapies for MCC,\nthe prognosis remains poor. With the incidence of MCC\nincreasing rapidly across Europe, prompt diagnosis and\neffective and harmonised management are imperative for\nimproving patient care.2\nThe European Parliament and the European Commission\nrecommend treating patients with rare cancers in centres\nlinked to the European Reference Network for Rare Adult\nSolid Cancers (EURACAN). In these referral centres with a\nhigh volume of MCC patients, the clinical experience of a\nmultidisciplinary team (MDT) specialising in skin cancers\nguarantees better treatment outcomes and access to\nclinical trials. Therefore, the objective of this guideline is to\nprovide a comprehensive reference for MCC, which is based\non a critical evaluation of current evidence and opinion of\nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) experts in\npartnership with EURACAN.\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nThe global incidence rates of MCC are difﬁcult to calculate\nbecause of its rarity, geographic and demographic vari-\nability and lack of large epidemiological studies.3 Since its\nﬁrst description in 1972, MCC incidence rates have\nsteadily increased, likely due to both the reﬁnements in\ndiagnostic capabilities and the progressively ageing pop-\nulation.4,5 The Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe\n(RARECARE) database reported the crude incidence esti-\nmate as 0.13 per 100 000 in 1995-2002.6 The incidence\nrate reported over time in the recent analysis of the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data-\nbase showed that in 1986, incidence and mortality rates\nper 100 000 were 0.22 and 0.03, respectively; these rates\nincreased to 0.79 and 0.43, respectively, in 2011.7 The\nhighest incidence rates of MCC are in Australia, where the\nage-adjusted incidence rate reported in Queensland was\n1.6 per 100 000.8\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: February 2024.\n2059-7029/© 2024 The Author(s).

In Australia, this\nis the opposite, with 80% UV- and 20% MCPyV-related.3\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nClinical diagnosis\nThe clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional lymph nodes (LNs),\ncomorbid conditions and patient life expectancy. MCC\nclassically presents as a pink or red-violaceous, painless,\nﬁrm, rapidly growing, dome-shaped or red plaque skin\nlesion, ranging in size from 1 to 2 cm. It typically occurs in\nolder patients in sun-exposed areas of their bodies. The\npredominant sites of MCC localisation include the head and\nneck (45%), upper limbs (24%), lower limbs (10%) and trunk\nor other sites (<10%), while in 11% of cases, there is no\nidentiﬁable primary lesion. Ulceration may occur in more\nadvanced MCC lesions. MCC enlarges rapidly, metastasises\nin transit to the skin and/or to ﬁrst-echelon LNs (26% of\ncases at initial presentation) and then to higher-order nodal\nregions and distant sites such as bones, liver and brain (8%\nof cases at initial presentation).12 MCC may be mis-\ndiagnosed as squamous- or basal-cell carcinoma, amela-\nnotic melanoma, adnexal tumour, primary cutaneous B-cell\nlymphoma or skin disorders such as pyogenic granuloma\nand\ninﬂammatory\ndisorders.13\nSince\nMCC\nhas\nbeen\nobserved contiguous to, or intermingled with, other skin\ncancers, the detection of polymorphous vessels and/or\nmilky-red areas by dermatoscopy enhances the differential\ndiagnostic accuracy, especially for patients with multiple\nskin lesions.14\nAetiology and molecular biology\nDespite major advances in understanding MCC carcino-\ngenesis, the cellular origin of MCC is still unclear. MCC has\nbeen hypothesised to originate from dermal ﬁbroblasts,\npre-/pro-B cells, Merkel-cell precursors potentially derived\nfrom epidermal stem cells and hair follicle stem cells.15 MCC\ncarcinogenesis can be initiated in the cell of origin either by\nUV-mediated DNA damage caused by chronic exposure to\nsunlight or by integration of the MCPyV into the host\ngenome.16,17 MCPyV is a ubiquitous virus usually acquired\nduring childhood, as indicated by frequent seropositivity of\nantibodies against the capsid protein VP1 in the blood.18\nHowever, primary infection with MCPyV does not cause\nany discernible signs or symptoms. Despite the high prev-\nalence of MCPyV infection, very few people develop MCC.\nAn essential feature of MCPyV-associated MCC is that the\ntumour cells express speciﬁc products of the viral early\ngenes, i.e. small T antigen (ST) and a truncated version of\nlarge T antigen (LT). LT and ST have also been referred to as\nviral oncoproteins, and their capacity to interact with mul-\ntiple cellular proteins, thereby altering their function, has\nbeen demonstrated.19,20 While MCPyV-associated MCCs are\ncharacterised by very low frequencies of somatic mutations,\nvirus-negative MCCs are among the tumours with the\nhighest mutational load, typically displaying UV signa-\ntures.21 Among the aberrations found in MCPyV-negative\nMCC,\nmutations\ndisrupting\nthe\ngene\nencoding\nthe\nretinoblastoma-associated protein RB1 (the key protein\ncontrolling cell cycle entry) are almost always present.\nAnalogously, RB1 function in virus-associated MCC is\ninhibited by binding the LXCXE motif of LT to RB1; in either\ncase, cells are unable to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell\ncycle.21 Interestingly, MCPyV is not found in cases of MCC\nassociated with cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, indi-\ncating that it does not play a part in these combined\ntumours.22,23\nHistopathology\nHistopathological features of MCC are those of a small-blue-\nround-cell tumour with a vesicular nucleus and scant\ncytoplasm.24 However, several different histopathological\npatterns exist, including trabecular, intermediate and small-\ncell variants. Neoplastic cells can also be large and may\npresent with a pleomorphic morphology. The nucleoli are\nmultiple and usually not prominent. Mitotic and apoptotic\nrates are frequently high. The tumour regularly inﬁltrates\nthe reticular dermis and subcutis. The epidermis, papillary\ndermis and adnexal structures are usually spared, although\nepidermotropism is observed in up to 10% of cases. The\npresence of intra-lymphatic emboli and isolated tumour\ncells close to the surgical margins may explain the high rate\nof local recurrences.24,25 As the histomorphology of MCC on\nhaematoxylineeosin (H&E) sections is rather nonspeciﬁc,\nthe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires immunohisto-\nchemical staining to rule out other tumours that display a\nsmall-blue-round-cell morphology (e.g. basal-cell carci-\nnoma; metastatic small-cell carcinoma, particularly from the\nlung; cutaneous lymphoma; anaplastic sweat gland carci-\nnoma; melanoma; Ewing’s sarcoma; neuroblastoma and\nrhabdomyosarcoma).24\nMCC cells express several types of cytoskeletal keratins\n(CKs), particularly CK20 (membranous and/or paranuclear\ndot-like), CK8, CK18 and CK19. A small subset of MCCs\n(<10%) are negative for CK20; these cases are characterised\nby a high mutational burden and are generally not associ-\nated with MCPyV. In addition to CKs, neoplastic cells also\nexpress chromogranin A, synaptophysin, cluster of differ-\nentiation\n(CD)56,\nneuron-speciﬁc\nenolase\n(NSE)\nand\nhuntingtin-interacting protein 1.

These markers should be\nincluded in an immunopanel for MCC conﬁrmation and\nexclusion of other diagnostic considerations.\nNo histological marker has been reliably associated with\nthe selective identiﬁcation of either virus- or UV-associated\nMCC: while positive staining for MCPyV LT strongly suggests\nan MCPyV-associated MCC, negative staining does not\nnecessarily rule it out.27,28 Although all of these markers are\nhelpful and essential for diagnosis, particularly in the\npresence of artefacts, no convincing evidence supports their\nuse to predict prognosis or response to therapy. Concerning\nthe latter, variable numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating cytotoxic\nT lymphocytes (not identiﬁed, brisk, non-brisk) are found in\nMCC tumours, and their presence is associated with a\nbetter prognosis, which is particularly favourable if their T-\ncell receptor repertoire is characterised by clonal diversity.29\nThe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires histopatholog-\nical examination of tissue obtained by incisional/excisional\nbiopsy.4 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other tissues such\nas fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical margins;\ntumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratumoural\nlymphocyte\ninﬁltration;\nimmunohistochemical\nproﬁle;\nMCPyV status and mitotic rate.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional LNs, comorbid\nconditions and patient life expectancy [III, A].\n\u0003 Histopathological MCC conﬁrmation should include H&E\nwith the dedicated immunopanel [III, A].\n\u0003 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other structures\nsuch as fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical mar-\ngins; tumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratu-\nmoural lymphocyte inﬁltration; immunohistochemical\nproﬁle; MCPyV status and mitotic rate [III, A].\n\u0003 Dermatoscopymayenhancedifferentialdiagnosticaccuracy,\nespecially for patients with multiple skin lesions [IV, B].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nThe preferred classiﬁcation is the eighth version of the\nUnion\nfor\nInternational\nCancer\nControl\n(UICC)\nTNM\n(tumourenodeemetastasis) staging and classiﬁcation sys-\ntem, which provides information for both management and\nprognosis of patients with MCC (see Supplementary\nTables\nS1-S4,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nesmoop.2024.102977).30 This classiﬁcation was developed\nbased on data collected from 9387 patients with MCC in the\nNational Cancer Database. Staging and risk assessment\nprocedures are determined based on disease presentation\nat diagnosis.31\nThe initial evaluation in MCC should include a complete\nexamination of the skin with particular attention to any\nsuspicious cancerous skin lesions, tumour satellites, in-\ntransit metastases, regional LNs and systemic metastases.\nThe assessment of disease extension in all patients is\nmandatory: ultrasound of regional LNs for patients with\nclinical stage I-II disease and computed tomography (CT) of\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis (and head/neck for head/\nneck primaries).32 Positron emission tomography (PET)eCT\nappears more sensitive than CT alone based on published\nmeta-analyses and other retrospective studies; it was\nshown that 16.8% of patients who underwent PETeCT had\ntheir disease upstaged compared with 6.9% of those who\nunderwent CT scans only.33,34 Therefore, if PET and/or PETe\nCT with [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) are available,\nthey are the preferred cross-sectional imaging methods to\nassess local and distant disease.16 If additional clinical\nsymptoms are present, detailed imaging studies using\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be carried out.\nSentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) with an appropriate immuno-\npanel is considered the most reliable staging procedure for\nidentifying subclinical nodal involvement. As such, it is\nrecommended for all patients with clinically node-negative\ndisease who are ﬁt for radical therapy. SLNB should be\ncarried out alongside local surgical therapy of the primary\ntumour with special attention to drainage patterns. The\nobserved 17.1% false-negative SLNB results may occur in\nimmunocompromised patients or tumours localised in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region.35,36 SLNB enables the\ndetection of micrometastases in approximately one-third of\npatients with clinically node-negative MCC, and its positivity\nrate is w20% for T1 and 40%-50% for T2 MCCs.37-39 In\nchallenging locations for SLNB, single-photon emission\ncomputed tomographyeCT techniques should be utilised.40\nAccess to a full pathological report with the number of\ninvolved LNs, the size of metastatic deposits and the status\nof the extracapsular extension is crucial for staging, pre-\ndiction and decision making.41 Patients with clinically\napparent nodal disease at presentation with an unknown\nprimary should have a biopsy for histological conﬁrmation\nof MCC.12,42\nThe 5-year overall survival (OS) in all MCC patients is be-\ntween 48% and 63%: 64% in patients without metastases\n(stage I-II), 51% in those with regional LN involvement (stage\nIII), 68% in those with an unknown primary tumour and 17%-\n29% in patients with distant metastases (stage IV).39,43-45\nRetrospective data have shown that unfavourable clinical\nprognostic factors are the presence of regional and distant\nmetastases, primary tumour diameter >2 cm and/or its\nextension beyond the dermis, location in the head/neck\nregion, >75 years of age, male sex and presence of co-\nmorbidity, especially immunosuppression (e.g. HIV, chronic\nlymphocytic leukaemia).3,39,43,46 The poor prognosis has\nalso been linked to histopathological futures such as posi-\ntive margins after resection, a high mitotic rate, inﬁltrative\n(rather than circumscribed) growth pattern, lymphovascular\ninﬁltration and p63 expression, whereas LT and RB1 protein\nexpression and intratumoural CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltra-\ntion correlate with a more favourable prognosis.10,12,24\nHowever, there are no prospective data available in MCC.\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n3\n\n---\nProgrammed\ndeath-ligand\n1\n(PD-L1)\nexpression\nis\nfrequently detected in MCC tumour cells and the tumour\nmicroenvironment. Nevertheless, its expression does not\ncorrelate with prognosis.47-49 Serum markers such as anti-\nbodies against MCPyV or NSE require further prospective\nvalidation.50,51\nRecommendations\n\u0003 SLNB is indicated to improve prognostic staging, e.g. to\nrule out occult nodal disease, but the precision of\nSLNB is less reliable in immunocompromised patients\nand in patients whose tumours are located in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region and with aberrant\nLN drainage [III, A].\n\u0003 Mandatory imaging studies comprise CT scans of the\nchest, abdomen, pelvis and head/neck (for head/neck\nprimaries). If available, whole-body FDGePET/CT is pref-\nerable over contrast-enhanced CT scan; MRI imaging of\nspeciﬁc organs should be carried out if clinically indi-\ncated [III, A].\n\u0003 The value of immunohistological markers, such as p63,\nPD-L1, NSE or CD200, is not fully established [IV, B].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nThe mainstay of treatment for patients with localised MCC\nis wide local excision (WLE) followed by tumour bed\nradiotherapy (RT) and management of the nodal basin. A\nproposed algorithm for the management of locoregional\nMCC is shown in Figure 1.\nSince wide excision can potentially compromise lymphatic\ndrainage, an SLNB should be carried out simultaneously with\nsurgical treatment of the primary MCC. A precise surgical\ntechnique called Mohs surgery may be considered instead of\nWLE in selected cases based on results from meta-analyses of\npatients with stage I MCC, which showed similar recurrence\nrates for both surgical modalities: local recurrence rates were\n6.8% for WLE versus 8.5% for Mohs surgery, and regional\nrecurrence rates were similar at w15%, although no rando-\nmised trials comparing traditional WLE with Mohs surgery\nwere included in these meta-analyses.52\nAfter resection, there is a need to obtain a clear patho-\nlogical margin, although the size of surgical margin is under\ndebate.53 In one publication, a margin >2 cm was associ-\nated with a signiﬁcant improvement in OS54; however, other\ndata have not supported a correlation between margin size\nbeyond 1 cm and additional clinical beneﬁt. In a study of\n6156 patients with localised MCC, resection margins >1 cm\nwere associated with improvements in OS compared with\nmargins of <1 cm; 5-year survival rates were 90% and 77%\n(P < 0.001), respectively.55\nAccording\nto\nﬁndings\nfrom\na\nretrospective\nstudy\ncomprising a cohort of patients who had clear margins\nfollowing resection and received post-operative RT, surgical\nexcision with margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus >1.0 cm was not\nassociated with any signiﬁcant difference in terms of OS,\nany recurrence-free survival (RFS) or local RFS.56 Thus,\nsurgical margins might be reduced to avoid reconstruction,\nespecially for preserving cosmetics (face) or function (lo-\ncations close to joints). Findings from this retrospective\nstudy also showed that excision, even with narrow margins\n(0.5-1.0 cm), was not associated with outcome. Cancer-\nspeciﬁc survival was 76.8% versus 76.2% for patients with\nresection margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus 1-2 cm, respectively.\nHowever, for patients with narrow resection margins, post-\noperative RT to the tumour bed is mandatory.56 In sum-\nmary, there is a need to obtain surgical margins of 1-2 cm\nand histologically negative margins, if feasible, which must\nbe followed by adjuvant RT regardless of the type of sur-\ngery.15,57-59\nThe beneﬁt of adjuvant RT following excision of the pri-\nmary tumour was shown in a systematic review and meta-\nanalysis considering >17 000 patients with stages I-III MCC\nfrom 29 observational studies.60 A favourable OS beneﬁt\nwas associated with surgery plus adjuvant RT versus surgery\nalone [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)\n0.75-0.86, P < 0.001]. The study also reported a signiﬁcant\nbeneﬁt in locoregional and local disease-free survival (DFS),\nbut not distant DFS (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.22-0.42; HR 0.21, 95%\nCI 0.14-0.33 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49-1.14, respectively).60\nThe largest series to date to assess whether adjuvant\ntherapy was associated with better survival included 6908\ncases from the National Cancer Database.61 It showed that\nfor localised MCC, surgery and adjuvant RT was associated\nwith a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in OS compared\nwith surgery alone (stage I: HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80; stage\nII: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89), but in patients with regional\nnodal metastases (stage III), neither the addition of adju-\nvant RT nor chemotherapy (ChT) had a signiﬁcant impact on\nOS. These ﬁndings suggest that the addition of RT may\nbeneﬁt the local control of localised disease; however, it is\nreasonable to believe that survival in patients with more\nadvanced disease may be driven by the presence of sub-\nclinical distant metastasis.61\nIt is worth noting that the MCC patient population con-\ntains elderly patients, which frequently causes clinicians to\ndeviate from standard treatment protocols. This was\nrecently\nillustrated\nin\na\nstudy\nthat\ninvestigated\nthe\nconcordance to adjuvant treatment guidelines in patients\nwith stage I-II MCC.62 Of the 2330 patients in this study,\n1858 had an indication for adjuvant RT [according to Na-\ntional Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines\ncriteria63] but only 57% of these patients received RT; those\nwho received RT had a 5-year OS advantage over those who\ndid not (76% versus 68%, P < 0.0003). Conversely, of the\n472 patients without an indication for adjuvant RT (ac-\ncording to NCCN criteria), 43% received RT; this group did\nnot show an OS beneﬁt over those who did not receive RT\n(79% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.48).62\nThe optimal adjuvant RT dose is unclear.64 In a retro-\nspective study of 2093 patients who underwent surgery\nfollowed by adjuvant RT, four groups of patients receiving\ndifferent doses of RT (30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy, 50-55 Gy and 55-\n70 Gy) were analysed; the 3-year OS rates were 41.8%,\n69.0%, 69.2% and 66.0%, respectively.65 An Australian study\nESMO Open\nI. Lugowska et al.\n4\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\n\n---\ndocumenting a dose response showed that no patients with\nmacroscopic MCC developed in-ﬁeld relapses at doses\n>56 Gy.66 Furthermore, in a large population-based study\nof patients with head and neck-located MCC (N ¼ 1625)\nundergoing adjuvant RT (85% with negative margins and\n15% with residual MCC), a dose range of 50-55 Gy conferred\na survival advantage compared with doses <50 Gy. There\nwas no signiﬁcant improvement by escalating doses beyond\nthis range, which could reﬂect toxicity-related morbidity or\ndeath from competing risks in this mostly older patient\ncohort.65 Therefore, a radiation dose of 50-60 Gy is often\nrecommended in MCC, achieving in-ﬁeld control.\nIn some patients, surgical therapy is not feasible due to\nthe extent of disease (technically inoperable) or the pres-\nence of signiﬁcant (co)morbidity. Since MCC is radiosensi-\ntive, RT as a single modality is an alternative to surgery in\nthis group. The natural history of patients treated with\ndeﬁnitive RT is out-of-ﬁeld relapse with in-ﬁeld control\nachieved in most patients.38 In a systematic review, an\nalmost 90% in-ﬁeld control rate was documented following\ndeﬁnitive RT with a mean dose delivered of just under\n50 Gy.38 Recurrences occurred at 39/332 sites (13 local\nrelapses, 26 regional) for a cumulative post-RT in-ﬁeld\nrecurrence rate of 11.7%. Of note, there was no association\nbetween RT dose and incidence of recurrence or non-\nrecurrence. RT of the primary tumour can also be curative\nwhen excision is not possible due to severe comorbidity\ndisqualifying the patient from surgery or in individuals who\nrefuse surgical treatment.67 However, there is also a lack\nof consensus regarding the optimal dose/fractionation\nschedule. Independently, the European Consensus-based\ninterdisciplinary guideline and NCCN guidelines propose\ndoses of 60-66 Gy for deﬁnitive treatment of patients with\ngrossly positive primary tumour resection margins and/or\nclinically evident lymphadenopathy.15,63\nManagement of early-stage MCC (stage I-II)\nIn the early stages of MCC (stage I-II), the standard treat-\nment approach is WLE of the primary tumour.15,68 In T1-4\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage I-III)\nPrimary tumour management\nLN management\nSLN\npositive\nSLN\nnegative\nClinically negative LNs\nClinically positive LNs and in CUP\nNodal dissection and/or RT [III, B]\nAdjuvant RT ± nodal\ndissection [III, B]\nClinical trials with\n(neo)adjuvant systemic\ntherapy [III,A]\nClinical trials with (neo)adjuvant\nsystemic therapy [III,A]\nSLNB with immunopanel [III,A]\nOperable:\nWLE ± RT [IV, B]\nObservation\nDeﬁnitive RT [III, B]\nInoperable:\ndeﬁnitive RT [V, B]\nor\nanti-PD-1 therapya [III,A]\nRT (high risk of false-negative\nSLNB)b [IV, B]\nFigure 1.

In a review of\n29 studies that included patients with stage I-II MCC, no\nsigniﬁcant difference in regional recurrence rate was\ndemonstrated with versus without adjuvant RT (14.3%\nversus 4.6%, P ¼ 0.31).38 Furthermore, similar regional\nnodal recurrence and OS rates were reported in a cohort\nof 240 patients who underwent SLNB or elective LN\ndissection\nwithout\nprior\npathological\nnodal\nstaging\n(P ¼ 0.056).69 However, in selected clinical situations,\nthere is value in adjuvant regional RT. It is recommended\nin patients with profound immunosuppression, if SLNB is\nnot carried out or its accuracy is questionable [i.e.\nanatomic compromise, aberrant LN drainage or the pres-\nence of multiple sentinel LN (SLN) basins which is typical\nin head, neck or midline trunk MCC].70\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III)\nPatients with stage III MCC have a competing risk of sys-\ntemic recurrence. On the other hand, in elderly patients,\nsevere comorbidity may lead to increased risk for intra-/\npost-operative complications and higher morbidity related\nto local therapy. Each decision on adjuvant therapy should\nideally be made within the conﬁnes of an MDT. In this sit-\nuation, there is a recommendation to include patients in\nclinical trials for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy when\navailable.\nIn the presence of microscopic metastasis detected on\nSLNB or during node dissection [pathological stage IIIA: T1-\n4, N1a, N1a(sn), M0], adjuvant RT alone or in combination\nwith complete LN dissection (CLND) may be considered and\nrequires an individualised approach. In a prospective study,\n163 patients with SLN metastasis only underwent CLND or\nRT, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in survival\noutcomes (5-year OS: 71% versus 64%, P ¼ 1.0; DFS: 52%\nversus 61%, P ¼ 0.8; nodal RFS: 76% versus 91%, P ¼ 0.3 or\ndistant relapse-free survival: 65% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.3,\nrespectively). With sufﬁcient in-ﬁeld control of macroscopic\nMCC, in selected fragile patients who cannot tolerate nodal\nexcision under local anaesthesia, RT as monotherapy should\nbe considered.71 Another retrospective study of 447 pa-\ntients with MCC and a positive SLNB collected in the Na-\ntional Cancer Database showed that adjuvant RT \u0004 CLND\nled to a survival beneﬁt compared with CLND alone or\nobservation.72 Therefore, in younger patients (<75 years of\nage) with fewer comorbidities, a multidisciplinary approach\nwith adjuvant RT and CLND may be beneﬁcial. However, the\npotential beneﬁt may be decreased by the potential com-\nplications of CLND, such as lymphoedema, post-operative\nwound infection, skin necrosis and wound dehiscence,\nwhich is higher in the inguinal basin than in axillary\ndissection (26% versus 9%, respectively).73\nNo randomised trials have evaluated the efﬁcacy of\nadjuvant ChT or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with\nMCC. Therefore, adjuvant ChT is not routinely indicated. The\ndata supporting CRT are derived from a retrospective study\nof 4815 patients with head and neck MCC.74 In male pa-\ntients with positive margins and a tumour size of >3 cm,\npost-operative CRT and RT both provided a survival beneﬁt\ncompared with surgery alone (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81;\nHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92, respectively).74 In a study of\n6908 patients in the National Cancer Database, there was\nno beneﬁt (or detriment) of giving adjuvant ChT to patients\nwith high-risk disease.61 In this fragile population, the risk of\nserious side-effects is signiﬁcantly higher due to existing\ncomorbidities, and ChT-related mortality is between 4% and\n8%. There is also a concern about the immunosuppressive\neffects of ChT, which may lead to the development and\nprogression of MCC.75-77\nA limited number of published case reports and series\nhave addressed MCC of unknown primary (pathological\nstage IIIA: T0, N1b, M0). This group has a better outcome\nthan patients with known primary and synchronous nodal\nmetastases.12,42 The recommendation in this group is to\ncarry out a biopsy for pathological conﬁrmation of MCC,\nFDGePETeCT to rule out distant metastatic disease and\nmanagement of the nodal lesions similar to that proposed\nfor stage IIIB MCC.\nFor patients with clinically positive nodal disease (path-\nological stage IIIB, T1-4, N1b-3, M0), cross-sectional imaging\nis advised before surgery. There have been no prospective\ntrials evaluating the appropriate extent of CLND clearance\nfor MCC; in the absence of such evidence, it is recom-\nmended to follow the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline\n(CPG) for cutaneous melanoma.78 An analysis of the SEER\ndatabase incorporated propensity scoring and matched-pair\nanalysis and reported no difference in MCC-speciﬁc survival\nin patients who received RT after CLND versus observa-\ntion.79,80 In another study, Lewis et al. carried out a data-\nbase analysis encompassing 1254 patients and found\nreductions in local and regional recurrences with similar\nrates of distant metastases, but no statistical difference in\nterms of OS and MCC-speciﬁc survival.81 Therefore, patients\nwith node-positive MCC should be considered for clinical\ntrials with (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy because neither\nadjuvant RT nor ChT has been associated with a statistically\nsigniﬁcant impact on OS.61\nSatellite or in-transit metastases (pathological stage IIIB,\nT1-4, N2-3, M0) at post-operative histology are caused by\nthe cutaneous or subcutaneous intra-lymphatic spread. The\nfrequency is unclear but it is always associated with poor\nsurvival.42,82,83 In bulky, multiple and/or frequently recur-\nrent locoregional metastases, isolated limb perfusion may\nESMO Open\nI.

In a phase I-II study (CheckMate 358) of\nnivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting, surgical resection\nwas conducted after two doses of nivolumab 240 mg given\n2 weeks apart.85 Among the 36 patients who underwent\nsurgery, 17 had a conﬁrmed pathological CR (pCR) and 18\nhad a partial response (PR) by radiological assessment. At a\nmedian follow-up of 20 months, no patient with a pCR\nexperienced disease relapse. Additional studies are required\nto conﬁrm the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and the\nextent of surgery or post-operative RT in patients with a\npCR.85 In the adjuvant setting, although initial reports failed\nto show a therapeutic beneﬁt with ipilimumab as adjuvant\nmonotherapy, interim results from a prospective rando-\nmised study suggest a beneﬁt in terms of DFS for the pro-\ngrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab.\nHowever, ﬁnal results from prospective randomised trials\nare required to determine the true beneﬁts of adjuvant PD-\n(L)1 blockade.86\nRecommendations\n\u0003 An MDT meeting comprising experts with signiﬁcant\nMCC experience should be convened to diagnose and\nmake decisions about therapy; the preferred option is\nparticipation in clinical trials [III, A].\nManagement of local/locoregional disease (stage I-III)\n\u0003 After excisional biopsy, WLE with a margin of 1-2 cm\nis considered adequate; if a resection margin of\n1-2 cm is not technically achievable, a narrower\nmargin (0.5-1.0 cm) with adjuvant RT may also be\nacceptable [IV, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant RT with 50-60 Gy to the tumour bed is recom-\nmended for tumours of \u00051 cm in diameter and/or with\nnegative prognostic features (stage \u0005IB) [IV, A].\n\u0003 In patients at very low risk of locoregional recurrence\n(stage IA), clinical observation may be an alternative\nbut such a decision should only be made at referral cen-\ntres [V, A].\n\u0003 When WLE is not feasible, deﬁnitive RT of the primary\ntumour is an alternative approach [V, B].\nManagement of early-stage MCC (stage I-II; T1-4 N0 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 SLNB should be carried out during local surgical therapy\nof the primary tumour with special attention to drainage\npatterns [III, A].\n\u0003 In patients with a negative SLNB, observation is an op-\ntion, but in case of a risk of false negativity of SLNB or\nwhen SLNB is not carried out, adjuvant RT to the primary\nsite and nodal basin may be considered. This decision\nmust only be made at referral centres [IV, B].\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III; T1-4 N1-3 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 After a positive SLNB, adjuvant RT alone or in combina-\ntion with CLND is recommended after an MDT discussion\n[IV, B].\n\u0003 In clinically positive LNs, multiple nodal involvements or\nextra-nodal extension of the SLN, regional LN dissection\nwith post-operative RT is recommended (or deﬁnitive RT\nin inoperable patients) [III, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant ChT is not recommended [IV, D]; patients should\nbe considered for clinical trials with (neo)adjuvant sys-\ntemic therapy of modern immunotherapies [III, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE\nDespite the recent advances in diagnosis and treatment,\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC remain incurable. Admin-\nistration of immunotherapy in the ﬁrst-/second-line settings\nis recommended (if there is no contraindication for immu-\nnotherapy).87,88 ChT, palliative RT, best supportive care or\nparticipation in clinical trials should be considered based on\nthe clinical situation. In patients with recurrent oligometa-\nstatic and resectable disease, surgical removal or stereo-\ntactic irradiation of metastases can be considered if\nsystemic immunotherapy is contraindicated or the disease\nis refractory. A proposed algorithm for the management of\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC is shown in Figure 2.\nImmunotherapy\nPD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors are effective in the treatment\nof metastatic MCC.89 These drugs allow the reactivation of T\nlymphocytes and the triggering of the adaptive immune\nsystem by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 of the\ntumour\nmicroenvironment\nand\nPD-1\nexpressed\non\nlymphocyte surfaces. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 restores the\nantitumour activity of effector T cells and the function of\nexhausted T cells.89\nDespite their proven efﬁcacy, resistance to immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can occur due to different\nmechanisms: intrinsic resistance in patients who do not\nrespond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or acquired resistance in\npatients\nwhose\ntumours\nprogress\nafter\nthe\ninitial\nresponse.90-92 Open questions regarding the immunogenic\ncharacteristics\nof\nboth\nMCPyV-positive\nand\n-negative\nMerkel-cell tumours and the lack of predictive biomarkers\nof response to treatment are still under evaluation. Clinical\nbeneﬁt was not associated with any other biomarker eval-\nuated to date, such as PD-L1, MCPyV status, tumour\nmutational burden or CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltration.90-92\nImmunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab [ESMO-\nMagnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale (ESMO-MCBS) v1.1\nscore: 4; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Euro-\npean Medicines Agency (EMA) approved], pembrolizumab\n[ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA approved, not EMA\napproved], retifanlimab (FDA and approved) and nivolu-\nmab (not EMA or FDA approved), have shown high\nresponse rates both as ﬁrst- and second-line treatments,\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n7\n\n---\nwith long response durations and greater long-term ben-\neﬁts, when indirectly compared with ChT. Therefore,\nimmunotherapy is recommended in this setting if no\ncontraindications exist.\nThe ideal duration of ICI therapy is currently unknown.\nOne retrospective analysis of data collected at a single\ninstitute showed that among 65 patients treated with\navelumab, 25 had an FDGePETeCT-conﬁrmed CR. The 12-\nmonth RFS rate in these patients was 88% (95% CI 0.74-\n1.0). Reasons for stopping treatment included completion\nof 1 year of treatment (13 patients), toxicity (5 patients) and\npatient preference (7 patients).93 Prospective data from\nlarger patient cohorts and with longer follow-up are\ntherefore required to conﬁrm the ideal duration of ICI\ntherapy in patients with MCC.\nAvelumab. The efﬁcacy and safety of avelumab, an anti-PD-\nL1 inhibitor, were analysed in the JAVELIN Merkel 200 study,\nwhich was divided into parts A and B.94,95 Part A included\n88 patients with metastatic MCC who progressed after at\nleast one line of ChT. After >2 years of follow-up, the\nobjective response rate (ORR) was 33.0% (11.4% CR), me-\ndian duration of response (DoR) was 40.5 months and the\nDoR was >2 years in 67.0% of responders.90,94,95 In part B,\npatients who had not received prior systemic treatment for\nmetastatic disease were enrolled; the ORR was 39.7%\n(16.4% CR) with 30.2% having a response lasting >6\nmonths; the median OS was 20.3 months. First-line avelu-\nmab treatment was generally well-tolerated, and no\ntreatment-related deaths or grade 4 adverse events (AEs)\noccurred.\nIn\nthe\npretreated\npopulation,\ngrade\n3-4\ntreatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were observed in 11.4% of\npatients. From December 2015 to March 2019, 494 patients\nreceived avelumab as a ﬁrst- or second-line treatment for\nMCC within an expanded access programme (EAP); the ORR\nwas 46.7% (22.9% CR) and the disease control rate was\n71.2%. Avelumab was also associated with long-lasting\ndisease\ncontrol\nand\na\npositive\neffect\non\nOS.90,94,95\nEmerging real-world data suggest that outcomes with ave-\nlumab in clinical practice are in line with those seen in\nclinical trials.96 Recently published global data from EAPs\nand retrospective studies reported ORRs ranging from\n29.1% to 72.1% [CR 15.8%-37.2%; PR 18.2%-42.1% and\nstable disease (SD) 7.1%-30.9%], with median progression-\nfree survival (PFS) ranging from 8.1 to 24.1 months.\nImportantly, immunosuppressed patients also beneﬁted\nfrom avelumab, with response rates equivalent to the\ngeneral population. The best outcomes were achieved when\navelumab was given as ﬁrst-line therapy. The most common\nAEs were fatigue and infusion-related reactions; autoim-\nmune hepatitis and thyroiditis were also observed.97\nPembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab, a humanised immuno-\nglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that selectively\nbinds PD-1 on the surface of T lymphocytes, has been\ntested as a ﬁrst-line treatment in patients with MCC.98,99 In\na phase II clinical trial (KEYNOTE-017), 50 patients received\npembrolizumab for up to 2 years. TRAEs of any grade\noccurred in 49 of 50 patients (98%) and 15 patients (30%)\nhad grade \u00053 TRAEs with one death due to pericardial and\npleural effusion. The ORR was 58%, with 30% of patients\nachieving a CR. At 3 years, the PFS was 39.1% with a median\nPFS of 16.8 months; the 3-year OS rate was 59.4%, with a\nmedian OS not reached.99 Age, gender, baseline tumour\nburden, anatomic sites of metastasis and tumour PD-L1\nexpression and viral status expression did not correlate\nwith ORR, PFS or OS.98,99\nNivolumab. Nivolumab, a fully human anti-PD-1 IgG4\nmonoclonal antibody, was evaluated in two prospective\nstudies in combination with ipilimumab. A randomised,\nopen-label, phase II trial showed that in 50 patients\n[including 26 who had received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy],\nnivolumabeipilimumab [with half of the patients also\nreceiving stereotactic body RT (SBRT) (24 Gy in three frac-\ntions)] was associated with a high response rate and an\nManagement of inoperable/metastatic MCC (stage III-IV)\nAssessment of PS and comorbidities\nFirst line: \nPreferred: clinical trial [III, B]\nAlternative: immunotherapy (avelumaba [III, A; MCBS 4]b, \npembrolizumabc [III, A; MCBS 3]b, retifanlimaba [III, A] or \nnivolumabd [III, A]) + BSC\nSecond line: \nPreferred: clinical trial [III, B] \nAlternative: palliative RT and/or ChT + BSC [III, B]\nThird line: \nPreferred: clinical trial [III, B]\nAlternative: BSC\nFigure 2.

Although the effectiveness of\nnivolumabeipilimumab looks promising, data are immature\nand limited to a small sample size. It is also important to\nconsider the signiﬁcant risk of severe AEs in the elderly MCC\npopulation. Findings from the phase I/II CheckMate 358\ntrial also suggest that nivolumab is active as monotherapy\nin patients with advanced MCC. Among 25 treated patients\n(22 assessable), the ORR was 68% and the 3-month PFS and\nOS rates were 82% and 92%, respectively.77\nRetifanlimab. Retifanlimab is a humanised, hinge-stabilised\nIgG4k, anti-PD-1 antibody that is EMA and FDA approved\nfor the treatment of metastatic or recurrent locally\nadvanced MCC not amenable to curative surgery or RT\nbased on data from the phase II POD1UM-201 trial. In this\ntrial, retifanlimab treatment resulted in an ORR of 52% (95%\nCI 40% to 65%) in ChT-naive patients (N ¼ 65; CR 18% and\nPR 34%) with a median DoR between 1.1 months and >24.9\nmonths. Twenty-two\npercent\nof\npatients\nexperienced\nserious TRAEs, including fatigue, arrhythmia and pneumo-\nnitis, and 11% discontinued therapy due to AEs (the most\ncommon AEs were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus,\ndiarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and nausea).101\nChT\nAs there are no randomised trials in patients with MCC and\ndistant metastases, the impact of systemic ChT on survival is\nunclear. To date, available data are insufﬁcient to determine\nwhich of the different ChT regimens ensures the best PFS\nand OS in patients with metastatic MCC.\nChT regimens that have been used to treat patients with\nMCC include taxanes, topotecan, a combination of etopo-\nsideecisplatin, etoposideecarboplatin or cyclophosphamidee\ndoxorubicinevincristine.102 Response rates ranged from 20%\nto 75%, with higher response rates in the ﬁrst-line setting\n(53%-61%) versus the second-line setting (23%-45%); among\nresponders, the median DoRs were w2-9 months.76,103,104\nUnfortunately, in this fragile, elderly population, the occur-\nrence of toxic deaths limits ChT usage; toxic deaths were\nobserved in 3%-10% of patients.76,103,104 However, ChT might\nbe proposed after failure on immunotherapy or when\nimmunotherapy is contraindicated.\nTargeted therapies\nIn the UKMCC-01 trial, the efﬁcacy of pazopanib was\nassessed in 16 patients with MCC and a median age of 73\nyears (range 56-90 years).105 A clinical beneﬁt was reported\nin nine patients (three had a PR and six had SD) with a\nmedian duration of 8.0 weeks (range 1.3-38.4 weeks). The\ntrial was stopped due to slow accrual.105 A lack of activity\nand limited tolerance were also shown in a phase II trial\nwith cabozantinib in patients with recurrent/metastatic\nMCC after platinum failure.106 Based on published results,\nthe use of targeted therapy is not recommended.\nWith regard to radioligand therapy, although MCC\nfrequently\nexpresses\nsomatostatin\nreceptors,\nGa68-\nDOTATOC and Lu177-DOTATATE have only been studied\nin a few patients and further clinical trials are needed to\ndetermine their role in MCC.102,107 As such, they should not\ncurrently be considered as a standard of care.\nPalliative RT\nPalliative RT has mainly been assessed retrospectively. In a\nstudy applying an 8-Gy single fraction, a CR with almost 80%\nof in-ﬁeld lesion control was documented in 45% of pa-\ntients.87 Another study comparing 8 Gy as a single or\nmultiple fractions (3 \u0006 8 Gy) documented a CR in 10%\nversus 48% and a recurrence rate of 41% versus 5% (P ¼\n0.04), respectively.108 Patients of poor performance status\nshould be considered for a lower dose hypofractionation\nschedule (e.g. 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions),\nwhich can still achieve tumour regression.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Patients should receive individualised multimodality\ntreatment in referral centres for rare skin cancers with\naccess to clinical trials [III, B].\n\u0003 In oligometastatic disease progression, surgical removal\nor stereotactic irradiation of operable locoregional recur-\nrence or a single distant metastasis should be considered\nin ﬁt patients, although systemic immunotherapy should\nbe considered as the ﬁrst step [V, B].\n\u0003 Immunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab (III, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4; FDA and EMA approved),\npembrolizumab (III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA\napproved, not EMA approved), retifanlimab (III, A; FDA\nand EMA approved) and nivolumab (III, A; not EMA or\nFDA approved), are recommended as ﬁrst- and second-\nline treatments if no contraindications exist.\n\u0003 In cases of inoperable/disseminated disease, ﬁrst-line\ntreatment with an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody is suggested\nas it is more effective and safer than ChT [II, B].\n\u0003 In patients with contraindications or after failure of\nimmunotherapy, palliative RT and/or ChT may be op-\ntions, but their impact on OS is uncertain [III, B].\nPOPULATIONS OF SPECIAL CONSIDERATION\nSince MCC is present mainly in elderly patients, use of\ngeriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity assessments\nare important for decision making to achieve disease con-\ntrol and assure an acceptable quality of life. For patients\nwho are not medical candidates for surgery, RT alone may\nbe considered. However, in patients with inoperable/met-\nastatic disease, given the relatively good tolerability of ICIs,\nthese agents are the preferred choice of systemic therapy\nfor this subset of patients.\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n9\n\n---\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Use of geriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity as-\nsessments are important for decision making [V, A].\n\u0003 RT alone may be considered in patients not suitable for\nsurgery [IV, A].\n\u0003 In elderly patients with inoperable/metastatic disease,\nICIs are the preferred choice of systemic therapy [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nAfter primary surgical excision, local recurrence develops in\n27%-60% of patients, regional nodal involvement is reported\nin 45%-91% of patients and distant metastases are found in\n18%-52%.42,109,110 Risk factors for recurrence include immu-\nnosuppression, advancing age, advancing stage of disease\n(stage II-IV), individuals assigned male at birth, non-SLN\nmetastases, MCPyV-negative status, as well as additional\nfactors as determined by the treating physicians. No formal\nclinical\ntrials\nhave\nevaluated\nthe\noptimal\nsurveillance\nschedule in MCC, either in terms of frequency or type of\ndiagnostic examinations. As the risk of relapse is higher in the\nﬁrst 2-3 years after initial treatment (40%-50% nodal and 33%\ndistant metastases),15 more intense follow-up should be\napplied in this period. Follow-up examinations are recom-\nmended every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, and then\nevery 6 months until year 5. After 5 years of observation, a\ngeneral physical examination is recommended every 12\nmonths lifelong, including a complete skin check-up. Physical\nexamination should include total-body skin examination and\nLN assessment with particular attention to the scar region,\nincluding the primary site, in-transit region and regional LN\nbasin. Distant metastases may develop in a wide range of\nanatomical locations; thus, routine cross-sectional imaging\nmay be proposed in higher-risk patients.\nThe radiological examination may be either a diagnostic CT\nof the thorax/abdomen/pelvis (and head/neck for patients\nwith head and neck primaries) or whole-body PETeCT, un-\ndertaken every 6-12 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, with ul-\ntrasound scans used for local LN assessment. After year 3,\nimaging studies should be carried out as clinically indicated.\nPatients with MCC have a higher risk for developing another\nskin cancer9,15,39,111,112; therefore, education regarding self-\nexamination of the whole skin surface is valuable. The role\nof MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncertain but it\nmay be utilised in patients who are seropositive at base-\nline.50,113,114 The early detection of a locoregional relapse\nmay be cured by surgery. However, inoperable/metastatic\nrelapse should be treated as metastatic disease, as described\nin the previous section.115-117 Therapy should be coordinated\nby an MDT at the referral centre.87,118,119\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Follow-up examinations are recommended in radically\ntreated patients every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years,\nand then every 6 months up to year 5. After 5 years of\nobservation,\na\ngeneral\nphysical\nexamination\nis\nrecommended every 12 months lifelong, including a\ncomplete skin check-up [IV, A].\n\u0003 Patient education regarding self-examination of the\nwhole skin is valuable as patients with MCC have a\nhigher risk of developing another skin cancer [IV, A].\n\u0003 The role of MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncer-\ntain, but it may be utilised in patients who are seropos-\nitive at baseline [V, A].\n\u0003 Routine cross-sectional imaging may be proposed in\nhigher-risk patients [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG has been developed by ESMO in partnership with\nEURACAN, in accordance with the ESMO standard operating\nprocedures for CPG development (http://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-GuidelinesMethodology).\nThe\nrelevant\nliterature has been selected by the expert authors. The\nguideline is conceived to provide a standard approach to\ndiagnosis, treatment and survivorship of MCC. Due to the\nrarity of MCC incidence, prospective and randomised\nstudies are limited; therefore, the basis of this guideline was\nmainly\ndata\nfrom\nretrospective,\nobservational\ncohort\nstudies, both institutional and cancer registry-based, often\nwith heterogeneous results. These studies have many limi-\ntations, such as selection bias, confounding factors, limited\nand missing data and lack of randomisation. Recommended\ninterventions are intended to correspond to the ‘standard’\napproaches according to current consensus among the Eu-\nropean multidisciplinary MCC community of experts. These\nare represented by the members of the ESMO Melanoma\nFaculty and experts appointed by all institutions belonging\nto the Rare Skin Cancer domain of EURACAN. Experimental\ninterventions considered to be beneﬁcial are labelled as\n‘investigational’. Other non-standard approaches may be\nproposed to the single patient as ‘options’ for a shared\npatientephysician decision in conditions of uncertainty as\nlong as some supporting evidence (though not conclusive) is\navailable. Algorithms accompany the text, covering the\nmain typical presentations of disease, and are meant to\nguide the user throughout the text.

The objective of the initial diagnostic\nwork-up of UKP-NENs is to identify the occult primary\ntumour. Metastatic patterns can be indicative of primary\ntumour location. The most common site for the occult pri-\nmary is the ileum followed by the pancreas.16 Ileal NETs\noften present as a mesenteric mass on computed tomog-\nraphy (CT).16 Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging (SRI)\nwith\ngallium-68-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-\ntetraacetic acid-labelled somatostatin analogue ([68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSA)epositron emission tomography (PET)eCT is the\nmost sensitive technique for NETs, detecting an occult pri-\nmary in 61% of cases.17 If SRI is uninformative, [18F]\nF-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)ePETeCT and endoscopy\ntechniques can be useful (see Supplementary Table S1,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664, and Section 3 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664).\nFor\nNECs,\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose\n(FDG)ePETeCT may be used. The presence of secretory\nsyndromes and elevated hormone levels may also facilitate\nidentiﬁcation of the primary NET. A minimum panel of\npeptide\nhormones\nshould\nbe\nmeasured\nin\npatients\nwith\nUKP-NETs\n[calcitonin,\nmetanephrines\nand\n5-\nhydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)]. Other hormones may\nbe measured depending on symptoms (see Supplementary\nTable S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664,\nand\nSection\n3\nof\nthe\nSupplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664). Chromogranin A has demonstrated a sensi-\ntivity of 71% and speciﬁcity of 84%-85% for the detection of\ngastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs.18\nIt is important to distinguish between primary GUGy-\nNETs and metastasis in the GUGy system from primary tu-\nmours in another site. Indeed, ovarian, testicular and renal\nmetastases occur in patients with GEP or lung NETs.\nSymptoms result from local inﬁltration in patients with\nmore aggressive GUGy-NENs and performance status (PS)\ndeterioration. Less than 15% of GUGy-NETs present with\nhormone-related symptoms (mostly carcinoid syndrome).1\nHN-NENs induce non-speciﬁc symptoms such as hoarse-\nness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, nasal obstruction, epistaxis and\nconductive hearing loss.19,20 Laryngeal NENs arise from the\nsupraglottic region in 85% of cases.8 Middle-ear NENs appear\nas a retrotympanic mass extending into the ossicles, mastoid,\nauditory canal and Eustachian tube.9,19 Sinonasal NENs occur\nin the ethmoid (64% of cases), nasal cavity (32%) and maxil-\nlary sinus (14%). The most common metastatic sites are the\nlymph nodes, lungs, liver and bones.21 Skin metastases can be\nextremely painful and suggestive of laryngeal NETs.22 Func-\ntional syndromes are rare and include carcinoid syndrome,\nsyndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hor-\nmone, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome and\nLamberteEaton myasthenic syndrome.23\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients\nwith UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs should be discussed in a\nNEN multidisciplinary tumour board (MTB) [V, A].\n\u0003 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs should be classiﬁed and\ngraded according to the common IARCeWHO 2018\nconsensus classiﬁcation together with the organ-speciﬁc\nWHO classiﬁcation [V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, IHC should be carried out to exclude para-\ngangliomas (cytokeratin) and to identify the primary [as a\nminimum: thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and\ncaudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX-2)]. Calcitonin, serotonin\nand other IHC markers may be used [IV, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, secretory syn-\ndromes should be diagnosed based on hormone-related\nsymptoms. As a minimum, metanephrines, 5-HIAA and\ncalcitonin should be measured in those with UKP-NETs\n[V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, cross-sectional imaging may identify meta-\nstatic patterns suggestive of a primary site (e.g. a mesen-\nteric mass indicative of an ileal NET) [IV, A].

FDGePETeCT may be helpful\nin NENs with a higher proliferation index (G3 NETs\nand NECs) [V, B]. [18F]F-DOPAePETeCT may also detect\nan ileum primary, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma\nin patients with UKP-NETs [V, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-NECs, searches for the primary\nshould not delay treatment intervention, apart from cuta-\nneous examination for Merkel-cell carcinoma and IHC for\ncytokeratin 20 and Merkel-cell polyomavirus, if available\n[V, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nAdequate staging of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs relies on\ncross-sectional imaging and nuclear medicine techniques.\nCT scans are effective for the detection of lung metastases\nwhereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is better for\nliver and bone metastases. MRI is also preferred in young\npatients as radiation exposure is lower. SRI has a high\nsensitivity for NETs and should be part of the initial work-\nup. SSTR scintigraphy is less sensitive and should only be\ncarried out when SRIePETeCT is not available. Whole body\nCT, or FDGePETeCT in case of limited tumour burden, are\nrecommended for the staging of G2-3 NETs and NECs.24\nStaging of middle-ear HN-NENs is based on the system\nproposed by Marinelli et al.19 while staging of GUGy- and\nHN-NENs is based on the eighth edition of the Union for\nInternational Cancer Control (UICC) TNM (tumourenodee\nmetastasis) classiﬁcation25 (see Supplementary Tables S2-\nS10, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). There is no staging classiﬁcation for UKP-NENs\nunless an occult primary is identiﬁed by the initial diag-\nnostic work-up.\nPrognosis for all NENs relies on pathological grading and\nstaging. In patients with metastases, differentiation, WHO\ngrade, age, PS, tumour burden, SRI and/or FDG uptake, the\npresence of a functional syndrome at baseline and tumour\ngrowth rate should be considered for optimal risk assessment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 CT and/or MRI are recommended for staging. MRI should\nbe mainly considered in young patients to reduce irradi-\nation anddusing late arterial phase imagingdimprove\ndetection of hepatic, pancreatic, brain and bone NETs\n[III, A].\n\u0003 SRIePET is recommended for initial and preoperative\nstaging, and when indicated for restaging [V, A].\n\u0003 FDGePETeCT can be used for staging G2-3 NETs and\nNECs [IV, B].\n\u0003 Major independent prognostic factors are disease stage\n(TNM) and pathological features including differentiation\nand WHO grade [IV, A]. Age, PS, tumour burden, the pres-\nence of functional syndromes and tumour growth rate\nare additional prognostic factors [IV, B].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nPatients with UKP-NENs may present with lymph node\nmetastases without the detection of a primary tumour or\ndistant metastases. For G1-3 UKP-NETs, radical resection of\nlocoregional\ndisease\nis the\npreferred\ntreatment\n(see\nFigure 1). While searching for an occult primary, the site of\nlymph node metastasis may guide surgical exploration (e.g.\nan involved mesenteric node is suggestive of an ileal pri-\nmary). There is no evidence to support adjuvant therapy\nfollowing curative resection of NETs. For UKP-NECs, down-\nstaging of locoregional disease with chemotherapy (ChT)\nand/or radiotherapy (RT) may be considered before surgery.\nSome patients with NECs, particularly with isolated inguinal\nor neck nodes, may have prolonged disease control and\nsurvival following multimodal treatment including sur-\ngery.26 In this setting, Merkel-cell carcinoma should be ruled\nout. It is unclear whether post-operative treatment of NECs\nimproves\noutcomes,\nbut\nfour cycles of carboplatine\netoposide may be considered, particularly if neoadjuvant\nChT has not been used.27\nThere are no prospective data on the management of\nlocal and locoregional disease in patients with GUGy-NENs.\nRecommendations are therefore extrapolated from site-\nspeciﬁc ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs).28 For\nGUGy-NETs,\nupfront\nradical\nsurgery\nwithout\nadjuvant\ntreatment is recommended when feasible (see Figure 2);\nhowever, a conservative surgical approach should be dis-\ncussed whenever possible, particularly for low-grade local-\nised NETs. The role of adjuvant therapy for G3 GUGy-NETs is\nalso unknown. For GUGy-NECs, multimodal therapy should\nalways be discussed for localised disease. Further details\nregarding the management of local and locoregional GUGy-\nNENs are available in Section 4 of the Supplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664.\nFor HN-NENs, locoregional treatment depends on the\nprimary site (see Figure 3). In the larynx, NETs are mainly\nsupraglottic and their sensitivity to ChT and RT may be low.\nBased\non\nretrospective\ndata,\nradical\nresection\nafter\ncompletion of whole body imaging (including PETeCT) is\nrecommended whenever possible with homolateral neck\ndissection, as it may lower the risk of regional lymph node\nrecurrence.8 Post-operative RT should be discussed in a\nmultidisciplinary meeting, particularly for G2 NETs.8 For\nlaryngeal NECs, treatment relies mainly on ChT and RT8;\nsurgery may be discussed in selected cases.29 For sinonasal\nNETs, surgery was associated with longer survival in retro-\nspective series.30,31 The role of prophylactic neck dissection\nis unknown. Post-operative RT should be discussed but\nthere is no evidence that it prevents locoregional relapse.\nFor sinonasal NECs, treatment should be multimodal.\nRetrospective data suggest that induction ChT is beneﬁ-\ncial,10 in combination with RT in most cases and surgery in\nselected cases.21,31 Most middle-ear tumours are NETs.\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment,19,32 but complete\nresection with no tumour at the margin (R0) is challenging\nand there is a risk of locoregional relapse when ossicles are\nJ. Hadoux et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\n3\n\n---\ninvolved. There are no data on post-operative RT; however,\nRT may be discussed for patients with a higher risk of\nrelapse due to adherence to important neurovascular\nstructures. RT might prevent extension to the skull base and\nsubsequent\ndebilitating\ncomplications.\nThis\nmust\nbe\nbalanced against the risk of long-term RT-induced toxicity.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-NETs with locoregional disease, the\naim of surgical resection with exploration is to identify\nand treat the primary tumour with microscopic radical\nintent [V, A].\n\u0003 For GUGy-NETs, surgery of the primary tumour and nodes\nwith microscopic radical intent (according to site-speciﬁc\nESMO CPGs) is the treatment of choice for local and\nlocoregional disease, irrespective of grade [V, A]. A con-\nservative surgical approach should be discussed when-\never feasible, particularly in low-grade, early-stage NETs\n[V, B].\n\u0003 For laryngeal and sinonasal NETs, surgery of the primary\ntumour with microscopic radical intent and homolateral\ntherapeutic neck dissection is recommended whenever\npossible [IV, A].\n\u0003 Adjuvant treatment cannot be recommended for UKP-\nNETs [V, D] but adjuvant RT may be discussed for GUGy-\nNETs in patients with microscopic (R1) or macroscopic\n(R2) tumour at the margin and/or G3 disease [V, C].\n\u0003 For HN-NETs, adjuvant RT may be discussed after radical\nresection, particularly in case of locoregional spread,\nnon-R0 resection and G2 disease; however, the beneﬁt\nin terms of local control is unknown [V, C].\n\u0003 For locoregional sinonasal NECs, neoadjuvant ChT with\nplatinumeetoposide may be considered before surgical\nresection [IV, C].\n\u0003 For NECs treated with radical surgery, adjuvant therapy\nwith four cycles of platinumeetoposide may be consid-\nered [V, B].\n\u0003 Neoadjuvant ChT may be an option for UKP- and GUGy-\nNECs [V, C].\n\u0003 Combining RT with ChT is recommended for HN-NECs [IV,\nA] and could be discussed for UKP- and GUGy-NECs as\ndeﬁnitive or (neo)adjuvant treatment [V, C].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nFor UKP-NETs there are few clinical trials with low patient\nnumbers and for UKP-NECs there are only retrospective\nFigure 1.

For advanced or metastatic\nGUGy- and HN-NENs, neither retrospective nor prospective\nstudies are available. Thus, recommendations for the man-\nagement of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs are based on the\nmanagement of NENs of GEP or lung origin and so systemic\ntreatments approved for GEP-NETs are used off-label in this\nsetting.28 When an occult primary is identiﬁed or suspected\n(such as a mesenteric mass from an ileal NET), its man-\nagement should follow the dedicated guideline.\nTreatment decisions (see Figure 4) should be based on\ncomprehensive multidisciplinary characterisation of the\ntumour (see ‘Staging and risk assessment’). In particular,\nWHO grade, differentiation (well versus poor),33 SSTR status\nbased on SRIePETeCT24 and presence of a functional syn-\ndrome should be considered.\nSurgery and locoregional therapies. Surgery should be\ndiscussed\nfor\nslowly\nproliferating\n(oligo)metastatic\ntumours in patients with G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs;\nthis includes surgical exploration for occult primary\nidentiﬁcation in case of UKP-NETs.34 Metastatic spread in\nHN-NETs frequently involves the skin, particularly in those\narising from the larynx.20,22 Skin metastases are usually\nmultiple and small in size, causing hard-to-treat pain and\ndiscomfort, which affects patients’ quality of life. In most\ncases, they are resistant to systemic treatment. Repeated\nlocoregional therapies may be used, including surgical\nresection, electrochemotherapy35 and RT for the largest\ntumours.22\nSomatostatin analogues. Two phase III trials [CLARINET\n(lanreotide) and PROMID (octreotide)] have reported longer\nprogression-free survival (PFS) or time to progression with\nsomatostatin analogue (SSA) treatment compared with\nplacebo in patients with metastatic GEP-NETs. Both studies\nincluded some patients with UKP-NETs but none with GUGy-\nor HN-NETs.36,37 Extrapolating the results from CLARINET\nand PROMID, SSAs may be recommended for tumour\nFigure 2.

Beyond SSAs, studies\nexploring the role of telotristat ethyl39 or interferon-a (IFN-\na)40 for carcinoid syndrome control included patients with\nany primary tumour site so their use is also applicable to\nUKP-NETs. No data are available on the treatment of\ncarcinoid syndrome associated with GUGy- or HN-NETs.\nManagement of carcinoid syndrome should follow the Eu-\nropean Neuroendocrine Tumor Society 2022 guidance pa-\nper on carcinoid syndrome and carcinoid heart disease41;\nmanagement of Cushing syndrome should follow the ESMO\nCPG on lung and thymic carcinoids.28\nTargeted therapy. Based on data from the RADIANT-2,42\nRADIANT-343 and RADIANT-444 trials (NETs of various pri-\nmaries), everolimus monotherapy may be considered as\nﬁrst-line treatment for SSTR-negative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and\nHN-NETs, or as second-line treatment after SSAs in patients\nwith progressive disease. The RADIANT studies, however,\nincluded only 36 patients with UKP-NETs and no patients\nwith GUGy- or HN-NETs. Based on the randomised CABI-\nNET,45 AXINET46 and SANET-ep47 trials, antiangiogenic\nmultikinase inhibitors (MKIs) may be considered as alter-\nnatives to everolimus for ﬁrst-line treatment of SSTR-\nnegative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NETs, or for second-\nline treatment after SSAs in patients with progressive dis-\nease. These studies included 34-49 patients with UKP-NETs\nor NETs of other origin not otherwise speciﬁed (see Sec-\ntion 5 of the Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nChT. In patients with progressive G2 (Ki-67 >10%) and G3\nNETs, alkylating agent-based and oxaliplatin-based ChT\nregimens may be considered.

Follow-up carries\nthe risk of excessive radiation exposure, so low-dose CT (for\nlung metastases) or MRI should be used whenever possible,\nespecially in patients for whom prolonged follow-up is\nanticipated. There is a consensus for the use of molecular\nimaging for SSTR-positive NETs, especially SRI with [68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSAePETeCT, at initial staging and for post-surgical\nrestaging, but not for routine follow-up.24 Molecular imag-\ning may play a role, however, in the follow-up of secondary\nlesions that are hard to evaluate with conventional imaging,\nsuch as peritoneal carcinomatosis and bone metastases.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected G1 and low G2 (Ki-\n67 <10%) UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-\ndose CT or MRI is recommended every 6 months for\n2 years, annually for years 3-5 and every second year\nthereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected G2 (Ki-67 \u000510%)\nand G3 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-\ndose CT or MRI is recommended every 3 months for\n2 years, every 6 months in year 3, annually for years\n4-5 and every second year thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or\nHN-NECs,\nfollow-up\nshould\nbe\ncarried\nout\nevery\n2-3 months for 2 years, every 6 months in year 3 and\nthen discussed on a case-by-case basis thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or HN-\nNENs, the best molecular imaging technique (according to\nSRIePET and/or FDGePETeCT positivity at initial staging)\nis recommended 6 months after resection and then in\ncase of unclear or abnormal imaging results [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual\nor metastatic disease, restaging is recommended every\n4-6 months [G1 and low G2 (Ki-67 <10%) NETs] or every\n3-4 months [G2 (Ki-67 \u000510%) and G3 NETs]; the interval\ncan be increased in case of stable disease [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual or\nmetastatic disease, systematic follow-up using PET imaging\nis not recommended but may be considered in case of\ndoubtful or abnormal imaging results, increasing bio-\nmarkers, clinical suspicion of new metastasis (particularly\nin the bone) and/or depending on the metastatic sites\nand their measurability using conventional imaging, espe-\ncially when locoregional therapies are discussed [V, C].\n\u0003 Patientswithdisseminateddiseasemaybeneﬁtfromreferral\nto specialised palliative care units for appropriate pain treat-\nment, psychosocial support and rehabilitation [II, B].\nPARATHYROID CARCINOMA\nIncidence and epidemiology\nParathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare neoplasm, accounting\nfor <1% of primary hyperparathyroidism cases.56 PC affects\nmale and female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of\n50 years. PC occurs as a sporadic form, or less frequently as\nfamilial forms such as hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour\nsyndrome (HPT-JT; w15% of cases) linked to a germline\nmutation in the CDC73/HRPT2 gene.57 Rarely, it can occur as\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 (MEN1) or type\n2A (MEN2A).58 Even in the absence of a family history,\n20%-40% of patients with apparently sporadic PC have a\ngermline CDC73 mutation.58,59\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nDiagnosis.\nClinical presentation. PC can be suspected in patients\nwho present with severe primary hyperparathyroidism\ncharacterised by severe hypercalcaemia-related symptoms\nand markedly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.\nLess than 10% of patients have normal serum calcium and\nPTH levels and present with a non-functional PC with only\nlocal symptoms, such as a palpable cervical mass, hoarse-\nness, dysphagia or dyspnoea.60\nLaboratory studies. Most patients with PC have markedly\nhigh levels of calcium (>14 mg/dl or 3.5 mmol/l) and non-\nsuppressed intact PTH 1-84 molecule (3-10 times above the\nupper limit of normal). The combined presence of high\nserum calcium (>3 mmol/l) and a parathyroid lesion >3 cm\n(the so-called ‘>3, >3 rule’), should raise suspicion of PC.\nSome patients with PC may overproduce N-terminal PTH\nfragment and have elevated serum and urinary levels of\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin; their determination could\nbe useful for differential diagnosis with benign adenoma,\nalthough this has only been tested in a small series.61\nImaging. Neck US is the ﬁrst-line imaging technique for\nthe diagnosis of parathyroid lesions. Its sensitivity varies\nfrom 67% to 96% with a positive predictive value of 89.7%-\n97%62; however, there are no speciﬁc patterns of malig-\nnancy (see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with cytology and\nwashout PTH measurement can help to differentiate from\nlesions of other origins (e.g. thyroid, distant metastases\nfrom other tumours).63 Complications associated with the\nFNA procedure (including occasional seeding) are rare.64\nContrast-enhanced CT and MRI can be used in highly\nsuspicious cases to evaluate inﬁltration of surrounding tissue\nbut are not routinely carried out for differential diagnosis.65\nParathyroid\nscintigraphy\nwith\n[99mTc]Tc-sesta-methox-\nyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) single-photon emission CT (SPECT)\nor SPECTeCT, in combination with neck US, is the procedure\nof choice for preoperative identiﬁcation of hyperfunctioning\nparathyroids.

Nevertheless, there are\nno clear scintigraphic parameters that allow a real preoper-\native differential diagnosis between PC and adenoma.\nPET procedures such as [11C]-methionineePETeCT and\n[18F]-cholineePETeCT are effective for the diagnosis of pri-\nmary hyperparathyroidism but their added value in the dif-\nferential diagnosis between PC and adenoma is unknown.66\nPathology. Histological diagnosis of PC is based on the 2022\nWHO classiﬁcation criteria: (i) vascular invasion; (ii) lymphatic\ninvasion; (iii) perineural (intraneural) invasion; (iv) local ma-\nlignant invasion into adjacent anatomical structures; or (v)\nhistologically or cytologically documented metastatic disease.\nThe morphology of PC is usually reminiscent of parathyroid\nadenoma or hyperplasia.67,68 Features suggestive of malig-\nnancy and warranting a diagnosis of atypical adenoma [also\ncalled parathyroid neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential\nor atypical parathyroid tumour (APT)] are macroscopically\nevident necrosis, size >3 cm, weight >500 mg, mitotic index\n>5 mitoses/2 mm2 and the presence of atypical mitosis67,69\n(see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Some rare\nvariants have been described, including oncocytic carcinomas\nand carcinosarcomas with more aggressive behaviour.70,71\nAlthough PC generally shows a higher proliferation index\n(Ki-67 6%-9% compared with <4% in adenoma), there is no\npredeﬁned Ki-67 cut-off to support or exclude a PC diagnosis.\nThe International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)\nhas issued a dataset on PC and APT that covers PC grading,\nconsidering it high grade in the presence of sheets of pleo-\nmorphic enlarged nuclei, coagulative necrosis, abnormal\nmitosis and/or increased proliferation rate.69\nMolecular biology. The most frequent molecular alteration\nin PC is on the CDC73 gene (40%-50% of cases). Phospha-\ntidylinositol-3-kinase\n(PI3K)eprotein\nkinase\nb\n(AKT)e\nmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the most\nfrequently altered pathway (40%-80% of cases).65,72,73 IHC\nevaluation of paraﬁbromin loss of expression to identify a\ndouble-hit inactivation of the CDC73 gene is a recognised\nancillary diagnostic method for malignancy, as is evaluation\nof loss of p27, other types of cyclins or cell cycle regulators,\ngalectin-3 and protein gene product 9.5.69,74\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Genetic testing for germline CDC73 mutation should be\ncarried out to rule out HPT-JT in all patients with PC,\nincluding those without a family history [IV, A].\n\u0003 The combined presence of markedly elevated serum cal-\ncium [>12 mg/dl (>3 mmol/l)] and parathyroid lesions\n>3 cm should raise suspicion of PC [IV, B].\n\u0003 US of the neck should be carried out to assess lesions sus-\npicious for PC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are used to evaluate\nlocoregional invasion before planning surgery [V, A].\n\u0003 FNA cytology and washout PTH measurements can be\nused to differentiate PC from other neck or thyroid nod-\nules but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [V, C].\n\u0003 [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBIeSPECT may be useful for the diag-\nnosis of PC but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [IV, C].\n\u0003 PC pathology reporting should follow the 2022 WHO clas-\nsiﬁcation (ﬁfth edition) and ICCR template [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe prognosis for patients with PC is variable, with 5- and 10-\nyear OS rates after surgery of w80% and 40%-80%, respec-\ntively. Good prognosis is associated with early diagnosis and\nradicality of initial surgery, whereas poor prognosis is mainly\nrelated to older age and the presence of lymph node me-\ntastases.75-79\nStaging is based on the eighth edition of the American\nJoint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system (see\nSupplementary Table S11, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).80 Only 15%-30% of patients\nhave level VI lymph node metastases and one-third have\ndistant metastases, most commonly in the lung, liver or\nbone. The detection of locoregional or distant metastases is\nbased on neck US, thoracic and abdominal CT, or MRI.\nAmong nuclear medicine techniques, total body acquisi-\ntion with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI can identify possible extra-\ncervical uptake and unexpected lesions. FDGePETeCT can\nalso be applied as PC generally shows high FDG uptake. It\ncan be used to complement conventional imaging in the\ninitial staging and for residual or relapsing disease, albeit\nbased on limited data.81 Other PET tracers such as [11C]-\nmethionineePETeCT and [18F]-cholineePETeCT have not\nbeen validated for routine staging of PC.66,81,82\nRecommendations\n\u0003 PC staging should follow the eighth edition of the AJCC\nTNM system [IV, A].\n\u0003 Cross-sectional imaging is the reference method [V, A] but\nadditional FDGePETeCT may improve staging accuracy\n[IV, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nManagement of hypercalcaemia. Medical management of\nhypercalcaemia is the main treatment for patients awaiting\nsurgery and those with inoperable PC. Cinacalcet, a potent\nsecond-generation calcium mimetic, is effective for con-\ntrolling hypercalcaemia in patients with inoperable or\npersistent disease.83,84 The greatest reductions in calcium\nwere reported in patients with the highest serum calcium\nlevels before therapy. The cornerstones of treatment for\nsevere or symptomatic hypercalcaemia are intravenous sa-\nline hydration and bisphosphonate administration (see\nSection 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nSurgery. Surgery is the recommended ﬁrst-line treatment\nfor PC (Figure 6).85 Inadequate and non-radical surgery\nrepresent the strongest prognostic factors for recurrence\nand mortality. In case of high suspicion of PC, en bloc\nremoval of the parathyroid lesion avoiding capsule rupture\nand local seeding, homolateral thyroid lobo-isthmectomy\nand central node dissection are recommended.86\nESMO Open\nJ.

Analysis of data from the National Cancer Database\nidentiﬁed 885 patients with PC who underwent surgery\nbetween 2004 and 2016, including 126 (14.2%) who also\nreceived external beam RT. The latter group had a higher\nfrequency of extensive regional disease, nodal metastases\nand residual microscopic disease. The 5-year OS rate was\n85.3% with a median follow-up of 60.8 months. RT was not\nassociated with a difference in OS based on multivariate\nanalysis87; however, small series from highly specialised\ntertiary centres have reported lower locoregional relapse\nrates in patients undergoing adjuvant RT,88-90 particularly in\npatients with R1 or R2 resection.90 Although not recom-\nmended for all patients, adjuvant RT should be discussed in\nthe case of R1 or R2 resection and/or lymph node metas-\ntasis (Nþ) and/or persistent hypercalcaemia.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Medical treatment of hypercalcaemia is required before\nsurgery [V, A].\n\u0003 Cinacalcet is recommended to control hypercalcaemia [II,\nA].\n\u0003 Hydration with saline infusion, at a starting dose of 200-\n500 ml/h, is the ﬁrst step in the treatment of severe or\nsymptomatic hypercalcaemia [IV, A].\n\u0003 The bone antiresorptive drug zoledronic acid is recom-\nmended as ﬁrst-line treatment and should be preferred\nover pamidronate for severe or symptomatic hypercalcae-\nmia [II, A].\n\u0003 Denosumab is recommended in patients with resistant\nhypercalcaemia [III, A; FDA approved, not EMA approved].\n\u0003 When a preoperative diagnosis of PC is made, upfront\nsurgery with en bloc removal of the parathyroid lesion\n(avoiding capsule rupture and local seeding), homolateral\nthyroid lobo-isthmectomy and central node dissection is\nrecommended [IV, A].\n\u0003 In case of pathological diagnosis of PC after parathyroid-\nectomy,\nreoperation\nwith\nipsilateral\nthyroid\nlobo-\nisthectomy and\ncentral node\ndissection\nshould\nbe\ndiscussed within 1 month of initial surgery [IV, A].\nFigure 6.

Brown\ntumours (osteolytic lesions of the bone caused by hyper-\nparathyroidism) should be differentiated from bone me-\ntastases, but this may be difﬁcult as they can show FDG\nuptake; MRI can be useful to better characterise bone le-\nsions.91 In case of known distant metastases, the probability\nof achieving a complete response is low and frequently only\nlocoregional treatments can control the disease.92 Cina-\ncalcet should be continued in case of persistent severe\nhypercalcaemia.\nData on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in PC are\nscarce with only 79 patients reported in the literature be-\ntween 1898 and 2018.93 A recent pooled analysis of all\nmetastatic PC cases reported that the most frequent\ntreatments were dacarbazine or anthracycline-containing\nChT and antiangiogenic drugs.93 The most frequent ChT\nprotocols included dacarbazine monotherapy, dacarbazinee\n5-FU, cyclophosphamide monotherapy or methotrexatee\ndoxorubicinecyclophosphamideelomustine, but response\nrates were low.93 Most cases in which antiangiogenics were\nused involved sorafenib.94,95 PC is usually radioresistant;\ndespite limited data showing that RT can be applied as\nadjuvant therapy to reduce local recurrence, its role is\nmainly palliative.85\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The efﬁcacy of systemic treatment in advanced and met-\nastatic disease is limited; thus, whenever possible,\ndebulking surgery and/or locoregional treatments should\nbe discussed to control tumour burden and hormonal\nsecretion [V, A].\n\u0003 First-line systemic treatment may involve antiangiogenic\ndrugs [V, B] or alkylating agent-based ChT (dacarbazine,\ntemozolomide or streptozocin combined with 5-FU or\ncapecitabine) [V, C].\n\u0003 Inclusion in clinical trials should be prioritised whenever\npossible [V, A].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nThe reported risk of recurrence is w50% at 2-5 years (based\nmainly\non\ncases\nin\nwhich\nnon-radical\nsurgery\nwas\nused).56,75-77,79 Laboratory follow-up includes lifelong mea-\nsurement of calcium and PTH every 3 months, although\nlonger intervals (up to 4-6 months) are an option.79 Pro-\ngressive and repeated increases in PTH and calcium levels\nare suggestive of PC recurrence and cross-sectional imaging\n(neck US, CT and/or MRI) should be carried out to identify\nthe site of recurrence. There is no validated role for scin-\ntigraphy with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI in the follow-up of PC.\nRecurrences and distant metastases can be small or\nbelow the resolution of imaging (<1 cm), and occasionally\nPC can evolve towards aggressive and rapidly progressive\nforms and lose the ability for signiﬁcant uptake of [99mTc]Tc-\nsesta-MIBI. In these cases, FDGePET can complement\nconventional imaging.\nThe identiﬁcation of a germline CDC73 mutation should\nprompt periodic screening for tumours associated with HPT-\nJT (ossifying ﬁbromas of the mandible or maxilla, benign\nand malignant uterine involvement, renal cysts).58 Genetic\ntesting should be carried out in all family members of\naffected individuals. In ﬁrst-degree relatives, measurement\nof\nserum\ncalcium\nlevels\nand\nUS\nmonitoring\nare\nrecommended.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Lifelong laboratory follow-up, including measurement of\ncalcium and PTH, is recommended every 3-4 months\nduring the ﬁrst 2 years, every 6 months during the sub-\nsequent 3 years and annually thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 In case of calcium and/or PTH elevation, neck US and CT\nscan of the neck, chest and abdomen together with a\nneck MRI are recommended [V, A]. FDGePET can be pro-\nposed to complete work-up, especially in rapidly pro-\ngressing cases [V, C].\nINTRATHYROID THYMIC CARCINOMA\nIncidence and epidemiology\nPreviously known as carcinoma showing thymus-like dif-\nferentiation (CASTLE), intrathyroid thymic carcinoma (ITC) is\nrare and believed to arise from the thymic remnants or\nbranchial pouch96 and, more rarely, from major salivary\nglands.97 ITC accounts for <0.15% of thyroid neoplasms.98\nFemales are affected slightly more frequently than males\nand the median age at diagnosis is 50 years.99\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nITC presents as a slow-growing neck mass with hard con-\nsistency and poor mobility, located at the lower poles of the\nthyroid gland. It appears as a cold nodule on thyroid scin-\ntigraphy and as a solid, heterogenous and hypoechoic mass\non US. Most patients have locally advanced disease with\ninvasion of surrounding structures, including the recurrent\nlaryngeal nerve, strap muscle, trachea, oesophagus, soft\ntissues and skin. Cervical lymph nodes are frequently\ninvolved but few patients have distant metastases.99 At\ndiagnosis, w20% of patients have dyspnoea, dysphagia,\nright laryngeal nerve paralysis and pain. FNA does not\nprovide a deﬁnitive diagnosis; histological conﬁrmation is\nwarranted.\nITC exhibits histological and immunophenotypic re-\nsemblances to eutopic thymic carcinoma. The tumour cells\ngenerally grow in a solid or nested pattern, identical to\nsquamous-cell carcinoma arising in the thymus. Positive IHC\nresults for cluster of differentiation (CD)5, CD117 and p63\nsuggest\na\ndiagnosis\nof\nITC\n(see\nSection\n8\nof\nthe\nSupplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\nESMO Open\nJ. Hadoux et al.\n12\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\n\n---\n1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Similar to thymomas and\nthymic carcinoma, on comparative genomic hybridisation\nITC is characterised by chromosomal imbalances such as\ngains on chromosomal arm 1q and losses on 6p, 6q and\n16q.100 The most frequently altered gene is the telomerase\nreverse transcriptase promoter mutation C228T, identiﬁed\nin 22% of cases.101 EGFR mutations have been docu-\nmented102 but their prevalence cannot be estimated due to\nthe limited number of cases analysed.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 ITC should be suspected in the presence of a cold nodule\nin the lower lobes of the thyroid gland with a cytological\ndiagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma [V, A].\n\u0003 Positive IHC for CD5, CD117 and p63 may allow for a pre-\noperative diagnosis [V, B].\n\u0003 Histological features that allow for a post-operative diag-\nnosis of ITC are lymphoid stroma, squamous-cell differen-\ntiation, infrequent mitoses and rare necrosis, positive IHC\nfor CD5, CD117 and p63, negative IHC for thyroglobulin,\nTTF-1 and calcitonin, and Ki-67 <20% [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nDisease stage is the main prognostic factor. Application of\nthe eighth edition of the UICC staging classiﬁcation25 for\nthyroid tumours is recommended, even if not speciﬁc for\nITC (see Supplementary Table S12, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Neck US, CT of the\nneck, thorax and abdomen, and neck MRI can be used for\nstaging. On CT, ITC appears as a well-deﬁned soft tissue\ndensity without calciﬁcation, whereas on MRI, it appears as\nan isointense and hyperintense mass on T1/T2-weighted\nimages.103 Similar to thymoma, ITC can show intense up-\ntake on FDGePETeCT; however, data on the use of FDGe\nPETeCT in patients with ITC are very limited.104\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Accurate assessment of local extension with US or MRI is\ncrucial for planning appropriate surgical intervention\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 CT of the chest and abdomen should be carried out to\nrule out the rare possibility of distant synchronous metas-\ntasis [V, A]. Complementary FDGePETeCT may be useful\nin some cases [V, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nSurgery is the treatment of choice (Figure 7). A pooled\nanalysis of published cases99 showed that thyroidectomy\n(total, subtotal or near total) was the most frequent surgical\nprocedure. Due to frequent nodal involvement at diagnosis,\nneck lymph node dissection [i.e. modiﬁed radical neck\ndissection (levels I-V), selective neck dissection of central\ncompartment (level VI) or lateral selective neck dissection\n(levels II-IV)] was carried out in >55% of cases. Among\npatients with a small ITC, 40% underwent thyroid lobec-\ntomy without lymph node dissection. RT was used in only\ntwo cases of locally advanced ITC not amenable to surgery\nwith radical intent.\nThe prognosis for patients with local or locoregional\ndisease is very good. In the pooled analysis,99 estimated\nmedian disease-free survival was 144 months (range 91-197\nmonths), median OS was not reached and w85% of\nFigure 7.

Hadoux et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\n13\n\n---\npatients were alive after 5 years. Based on these data,\nsurgery is recommended as the ﬁrst-line therapeutic option\nin patients with ITC with locoregional disease. The type of\nsurgery (i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be plan-\nned according to the available guideline for thyroid can-\ncers,28 using conservative surgical treatment whenever\npossible. Adjuvant RT does not improve prognosis and can\nbe avoided in most patients, although it may be discussed\nfor more advanced or aggressive cases. There is no role for\nadjuvant ChT. Patients with locoregional disease not\namenable to surgery with radical intent could be offered RT\nor chemoradiotherapy (CRT).\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Surgery is the mainstay of therapy. The type of surgery\n(i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be planned ac-\ncording to the available guidelines for thyroid cancers\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 Due to the indolent course of the disease and its good\nprognosis, conservative surgical treatment is preferred\nwhenever possible [V, B].\n\u0003 Neck dissection should be carried out according to guide-\nlines for thyroid cancers [V, A].\n\u0003 RT or CRT are reasonable options in case of locally\nadvanced disease not suitable for radical surgery [V, B].\n\u0003 If possible, adjuvant RT should be avoided due to the\nindolent disease course of ITC [IV, D]. It is an option in\nselected cases after careful multidisciplinary discussion\n[IV, B].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nAmong 120 patients with ITC who underwent primary\ntumour resection, 29 (24%) experienced recurrence at a\nmedian of 19 months (range 13-25 months).99 The recur-\nrence was locoregional in 21 patients (72%), and was\ntreated surgically in 90% and using RT in 42% of cases, with\nexcellent prognosis. A minority (w10%) of patients devel-\noped distant metastases; ﬁve patients (4%) had metastases\nat diagnosis and eight (6%) developed metachronous\ndistant metastases. The most common metastatic site was\nthe lung. Data on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in\npatients with metastatic ITC are limited. Similar to the\nrecommendations for locally advanced or metastatic thy-\nmoma or thymic carcinoma,28 cisplatin-containing regimens\nhave been used in most ITC cases, with a reported objective\nremission rate of 58%.99 Immunotherapy with the immune\ncheckpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab was used in one case,\nresulting in long-lasting disease control. Based on this single\nexperience, it is not possible to recommend immuno-\ntherapy for the treatment of metastatic ITC.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In case of local recurrence, salvage surgery is recommen-\nded [IV, A] and adjuvant RT may be discussed by an MTB\nfor patients who have not received prior RT [V, B].\n\u0003 In case of metastatic disease, cisplatin-based combination\nChT regimens with either doxorubicin and cyclophospha-\nmide or etoposide are the recommended options [V, B].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up is aimed at identifying locoregional recurrences\nand, more rarely, distant recurrences, usually within the ﬁrst\n5 years after initial treatment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In localised disease, neck US and CT scan of the neck and\nthorax are recommended 6-12 months after initial treat-\nment and then annually up to 5 years [V, C].\n\u0003 In metastatic disease, follow-up by CT and/or MRI (in case\nof liver, bone or brain metastases) every 3-6 months is rec-\nommended, depending on the tumour growth rate [V, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG was developed in accordance with the ESMO\nstandard\noperating\nprocedures\nfor\nCPG\ndevelopment\n(https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-\nMethodology).

Die Größe des Adenoms (2,5 cm) und die Symptome (Müdigkeit, Knochenschmerzen) deuten auf eine Notwendigkeit zur Behandlung hin. Die Patientin ist 45 Jahre alt und hat keine bekannten Kontraindikationen für eine Operation. Die Diagnose eines pPA ist eindeutig.\n</beurteilung>\n\n<therapieempfehlung>\nDie primäre Therapieempfehlung für die Patientin ist eine parathyreoidektomie (Entfernung des Adenoms). Die Operation sollte idealerweise durch einen erfahrenen Chirurgen durchgeführt werden, der mit parathyreoidalen Operationen vertraut ist. Vor der Operation sollte eine präoperative Lokalisation des Adenoms mittels bildgebender Verfahren (z.B. Ultraschall, Sestamibi-Szintigraphie oder 4D-CT) erfolgen, um die chirurgische Planung zu erleichtern. Eine präoperative Kalzium-Senkung ist in der Regel nicht erforderlich, es sei denn, die Hyperkalzämie ist sehr schwerwiegend oder die Patientin ist dehydriert. Nach der Operation sollte die Patientin auf eine anhaltende Hyperkalzämie oder Hypokalzämie überwacht werden.\n</therapieempfehlung>\n\n<begründung>\nDie parathyreoidektomie ist die einzige kurative Behandlung für primären Hyperparathyreoidismus (pHPT), der durch ein pPA verursacht wird. Die Operation führt in der Regel zu einer Normalisierung der Serum-Calcium- und PTH-Spiegel und lindert die Symptome des pHPT. Die ESMO-Leitlinien empfehlen die parathyreoidektomie als Standardbehandlung für symptomatische oder asymptomatische Patienten mit pHPT, die bestimmte Kriterien erfüllen (z.B. Serum-Calcium > 1 mg/dL über der oberen Normgrenze, Knochenmineraldichte < -2,5 SD, Nierensteine, Alter < 50 Jahre). Die Patientin erfüllt mehrere dieser Kriterien (Symptome, Alter < 50 Jahre, Adenomgröße > 1 cm). Die Operation ist in der Regel sicher und effektiv, mit einer hohen Erfolgsrate und geringen Morbidität. Alternative Behandlungen wie eine medikamentöse Therapie (z.B. mit Bisphosphonaten oder Denosumab) oder eine Beobachtung sind in der Regel nur für Patienten geeignet, die nicht operiert werden können oder möchten. Da die Patientin keine Kontraindikationen für eine Operation hat, ist die parathyreoidektomie die bevorzugte Behandlung.\n</begründung>\n```",

Both malignancies are rare. ACC has an estimated\nincidence of w0.5-2 new cases per million people per year.1,2\nPhaeochromocytomas are catecholamine-producing neuro-\nendocrine tumours arising from chromafﬁn cells of the\nadrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia. The latter are\nusually called paraganglioma, leading to the combined term\nphaeochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs). The\ndetected incidence of PPGLs is commonly reported at 2-8 per\nmillion per year3 (supplementary information, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).\nAll patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL\nshould be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team\nmeeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis (ideally\nbefore surgery) and in case of progressive disease.\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nEvery patient with (suspected) ACC or PPGL should undergo\ncareful clinical assessment, including case history, clinical\nexamination for symptoms and signs of adrenal hormone\nexcess. For more details on this topic, we refer to more\ncomprehensive guidelines and reviews.3-8\nHormonal evaluation\nThe aims of hormonal evaluation are multiple: (i) hormone\nassays provide orientation to the nature of the adrenal\nmass and can be useful to assess presence of malignancy;\n(ii) a phaeochromocytoma should always be ruled out,\nbecause these tumours can induce life-threatening crises,\nrequiring speciﬁc management before any intervention; (iii)\nmassive adrenocortical steroid excess can impact short-\nterm survival and quality of life (QoL), requiring speciﬁc\ntreatments to block impacts of hormonal excess; (iv)\nabnormal hormone secretions may serve as biological\nmarkers for the follow-up of patients; (v) in case of large\nbilateral adrenal masses, a systematic assessment of adre-\nnal function is recommended to rule out adrenal insufﬁ-\nciency.

For differential diag-\nnosis of an adrenal mass, computed tomography (CT) and\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both effective [IV, A].\nAlthough these methods cannot determine the exact entity\nof the mass, both are able to correctly diagnose a subset of\nbenign tumoursdat least when carried out according to\nstate-of-the-art criteria. The single best criterion to diagnose\na benign tumour (e.g. adenoma) remains Hounsﬁeld units\n\u000210 in an unenhanced CT.17 However, other imaging\ncriteria, such as rapid washout in 10- or 15-min delayed\ncontrast-enhanced CT, signal intensity loss using opposed-\nphase MRI, and low 2-ﬂuorine-18 [18F]ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-\nglucose (FDG) uptake in [18F]FDG-positron electron to-\nmography (PET)/CT are also suggestive of a benign tumour.\nMost ACCs show an inhomogeneous appearance in CT or\nMRI with irregular margins and irregular enhancement of\nsolid components after intravenous injection of contrasted\nagent. Detection of local invasion or tumour extension into\nthe inferior vena cava, as well as lymph node or other\nmetastasesdincluding lung and liverdis mandatory before\nplanning any surgery. Therefore, cross-sectional imaging\nof the chest, abdomen and pelvis is required preoperatively\n[V, A].\nFor PPGLs, conventional radiological imaging can be\nimportant to determine the presence of metastases. How-\never, neither CT nor MRI can be used to determine whether\nPPGLs are benign or malignant. Malignancy can only be\ndetermined from the presence of metastatic lesions at sites\nwhere chromafﬁn cells are normally absent. Without such\nevidence, all PPGLs should be considered potentially ma-\nlignant, with risk dependent on several factors as outlined\nbelow.\nThere are a number of functional imaging modalities\navailable for patients with PPGLs (supplementary File,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). The indication is twofold: (i) best tumour staging in\npatients with suspected metastases (e.g. by conventional\nimaging) or with presumably high risk for metastases; (ii) to\nevaluate the option of a radionuclide-based therapy in pa-\ntients with nonresectable PPGL. For assessments of meta-\nstatic risk for the ﬁrst indication the authors suggest the\npresence of one or more of the following criteria:\n\u0003 tumour size \u00045 cm;\n\u0003 any extra-adrenal paraganglioma;\n\u0003 known succinate dehydrogenase complex iron sulfur\nsubunit B (SDHB) germline mutation; or\n\u0003 plasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above\nthe upper cut-offs of reference intervals.\nFor imaging-based diagnosis of metastatic PPGLs, it is\nimportant to avoid confusing metastases with multiple\nprimary tumours that often occur in patients with heredi-\ntary PPGL syndromes. Additionally, local recurrences should\nnot be misdiagnosed as metastases.\nPathology\nBiopsy of adrenal tumours is usually contraindicated\nbecause of the risk of tumour spillage, poor diagnostic po-\nwer to discriminate benign from malignant adrenocortical\ntumours and risk of hypertensive crises in phaeochromo-\ncytoma. However, a biopsy might be indicated in an adrenal\nmass without any hormone excess in patients with a history\nof extra-adrenal cancers to exclude or prove an adrenal\nmetastasis of an extra-adrenal malignancy, and in patients\nin whom tumour sequencing is desired.\nThe pathological differential diagnosis of adrenal neo-\nplasias in both biopsied and resected specimens is primarily\nbased on morphological features requiring an experienced\npathologist [IV, A]. Preferably, a panel of immunohisto-\nchemical markers should be applied to aid diagnosis; for\nexample, steroidogenesis factor 1 (SF1) or, alternatively,\ninhibin-alpha, calretinin and melan-A for identiﬁcation of\nadrenocortical tumours and chromogranin A for identiﬁca-\ntion of PPGL [IV, A]. Staining for tyrosine hydroxylase and\nsynaptophysin may also be helpful to highlight PPGL, but\npositive results for synaptophysin are also possible in\nadrenocortical tumours. The differential diagnosis between\nACC and adenoma may be challenging as no single marker\nindicates malignancy. The most widely used diagnostic score\nhas been introduced by Weiss18,19 and includes nine pa-\nrameters (supplementary Table S1, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099) [IV, A]. A score of \u00043\nsuggests malignancy. In addition, the Ki-67 labelling index,\nas a marker of proliferative activity, may be useful and is\nvery\nhelpful\nfor\nprognostic\npurposes\n(supplementary\nTables S2 and S3, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nannonc.2020.08.2099).\nFor phaeochromocytomas, the situation is similarly\ndemanding. Tumour size, SDHB mutation status, extra-\nadrenal location and plasma methoxytyramine may all be\nused to indicate riskof metastasis. However,there is no single\nhistological or immunohistochemical parameter that can\npredict the clinical behaviour of PPGL. Nevertheless, several\nhistological scoring systems have been developed.20-23 All\nthese scores have value but none of them has reached\ngeneral acceptance. Therefore, according to the current\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcation, all PPGLs\nshould be considered to have some malignant potential.24 A\ndeﬁnitive diagnosis of malignancy can only be made by the\npresence of metastases at sites where chromafﬁn tissue is\nnormally absent (e.g. liver, bone, lungs or lymph nodes),\nassessed by pathology or imaging, in particular functional\nimaging.\nM.

The\ngene encoding subunit B of the SDHB complex is by far the\nmost important molecular contributor to malignant PPGL,\nwith at least 40% of all cases of metastatic PPGLs carrying\nmutations of this gene.25 Inactivation of SDHB reduces\nfunction of the succinate dehydrogenase complex, leading\nto activation of the hypoxia-inducible pathway and a\npseudohypoxic state characterised by increased angiogen-\nesis, growth and expression of mitogenic factors,26 but also\nto DNA hypermethylation, which is believed to provide a\nfurther drive to metastatic progression.27\nAt least 35% of PPGLs result from germline mutations of\nover 18 tumour-susceptibility genes identiﬁed to date,28-33\nwith those resulting in stabilisation of hypoxia-inducible fac-\ntors 1a and 2a (HIF1a and HIF2a) carrying a higher risk of\nmetastatic disease than those due to other mutations\n(supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). Risk is particularly high, reach-\ning 70% in patients with PPGL due to mutations in the SDHB\ngene.34 The vast majority of all metastatic PPGLs, including\ndisease due to SDHB mutations, develop from noradrenergic\nor dopaminergic PPGLs with poorly developed secretory\npathways. Nevertheless, a small minority of about 10% of\nmetastatic PPGLs develop from adrenal adrenergic tumours\nthat are characterised by production of epinephrine, as man-\nifested by increased plasma or urinary metanephrine.35\nOf note, metastatic disease may only become apparent\nmany years after the primary tumour is resected. This and\nlater development in some patients of locally recurrent\ndisease underscore the importance of recommendations for\nfollow-up of all patients with previously resected PPGLs.9\nRecommendations\n\u0003 All patients with an adrenal tumour suspected to be an\nACC or a phaeochromocytoma should undergo careful\nclinical assessment for signs of adrenal hormone excess.\n\u0003 All patients with suspected and proven ACC or PPGL\nshould be discussed in a multidisciplinary expert team\nmeeting, at least at the time of initial diagnosis and in\ncase of progressive disease.\n\u0003 All patients with suspected ACC require a comprehensive\nendocrinework-uptoidentifypotentialautonomousexcess\nTable 1.

Recent data suggest\nthat lymph node involvement correlates with stage IV\nrather than stage III behaviour.37\nOverall, the prognosis of ACC is limited. However, pro-\nspective data suggest that in patients with complete\nresection of a localised stage II tumour 5-year overall sur-\nvival (OS) can be as high as 90%.38 In metastatic ACC, me-\ndian survival is about 15 months. However, even in this\ngroup, there is a subgroup of patients with long-term\nsurvival.36,37\nIt is well established that disease stage and margin-free\nresection are currently the most important prognostic fac-\ntors in ACC. For the European Society of Endocrinology\n(ESE)eENSAT guidelines, a comprehensive literature search\nfor prognostic factors has been carried out and only the\nproliferation marker Ki-67 and glucocorticoid excess showed\na robust association with prognosis [IV, A] (supplementary\nTable S2, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.\n08.2099).4,39 Many other (molecular) markers for aggres-\nsiveness and survival have been recently proposed, but their\nclinical use requires validation.\nPPGL\nIn 2017,the WHO proposed a tumourstaging system for PPGL\n(supplementary Table S6, available at https://doi.org/10.1\n016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).24 Although this staging classi-\nﬁcation remains to be validated, the authors recommend\nusing this system to harmonise disease classiﬁcation.\nDespite limitations, the authors suggest assessing the risk\nof metastatic disease in an individualised manner, taking into\naccount previous history of disease and the presence or\nabsence of a germline mutation of a tumour-susceptibility\ngene (supplementary Table S4, available at https://doi.org/\n10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099). For ﬁrst-time patients\nwithout any history of disease or known mutation, size and\nlocation of the primary tumour, and when available, any el-\nevations of plasma methoxytyramine during biochemical\ntesting seem important to consider when evaluating risk\nfor malignancy. As described above, the authors suggest\nestablishing ‘high risk of metastases’ when any patient pre-\nsents with one or more of the following criteria: (i) adrenal\nphaeochromocytoma \u00045 cm; (ii) an extra-adrenal para-\nganglioma; (iii) a known SDHB germline mutation; or (iv)\nplasma methoxytyramine more than threefold above the\nupper limit of reference intervals. In these patients, whole-\nbody functional imaging may be justiﬁed, particularly for\ncases involving more than one of those four criteria.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The ENSAT TNM system should be used for initial staging\nof ACC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Genetic counselling should be offered to all patients with\nPPGL.\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nSurgery\nSurgery is essential for treatment of both ACC and phaeo-\nchromocytoma. Adrenal surgery should be carried out only\nby surgeons with appropriate expertise and experience. The\nlack of consensus on what is deﬁned as appropriate expe-\nrience and the absence of evidence that a speciﬁc experi-\nence in adrenal surgery translates into improved outcomes\nlimit any recommendations concerning this issue.40-42 The\nrecent ESEeENSAT guidelines on ACC suggest a minimal\nannual workload of six adrenalectomies per year, but with\na preference for >20 surgeries per year. In addition to\nexpertise in adrenal surgery, sufﬁcient experience in onco-\nlogical surgery is essential [V, B].4 For best clinical outcome,\nthe entire operative team (including anaesthesiologists)\nshould be well-trained in adrenal surgery.\nM.

Therefore, a\nmargin-free complete resection (R0 resection) is key to\nachieving long-term survival [V, A].2,44 In order to obtain an\nR0 resection of a locally advanced ACC, it may be necessary\nto resect (parts of) adjacent organs such as the wall of the\nvena cava, liver, spleen, colon, pancreas and/or stomach [V,\nB]. Complete en bloc resection of the tumoural mass,\nincluding periadrenal fat and adjacent organs if necessary, is\nmandatory to avoid tumour rupture or spillage that por-\ntends an adverse outcome.45 Locoregional lymphadenec-\ntomy improves tumour staging and seems to lead to a\nfavourable oncological outcome.46\nRoutine lymphadenectomy should include at least the\nperiadrenal and hilar nodes [IV, A], although the best extent\nFigure 2.

One study with 207 patients\n(including 88 with mitotane) found that adjuvant mitotane\nwas associated with worse recurrence-free survival (RFS)50;\nhowever, the mitotane group was likely selected for a higher\nrisk of recurrence, a bias that cannot be fully adjusted for in\nmultivariate analysis.\nProbably, the best evidence supporting adjuvant mitotane\nuse comes from a multicentre, case-control study that cir-\ncumvented confounders by comparing patient groups treated\nat centres adopting two different treatment strategies. The\nstudy involved 177 patients, of whom 47 were followed in\nItalian reference centres that systematically adopted adjuvant\nmitotane to all radically operated ACC. Fifty-ﬁve Italian pa-\ntients and 75 German patients were followed in institutions\nnot administering adjuvant mitotane therapy.51 The outcome\nof this cohort has been recently updated, conﬁrming that the\nmitotane-treated patients have prolonged RFS compared with\npatients left untreated after surgery.52\nTwo recent meta-analyses have reported that adjuvant\nmitotane treatment reduces the risk of recurrence and\ndeath.4,53 In both analyses, the beneﬁt associated with mito-\ntane was signiﬁcant forOS, whereas itwas signiﬁcant forRFS in\nonly one study.53 Another retrospective multicentre study\ndemonstrated that blood mitotane concentrations \u000414 mg/l\nwere associated with a prolonged RFS in patients treated with\nadjuvant mitotane following macroscopically radical surgery.54\nOn these bases, the recent ESEeENSAT guidelines on the\nmanagement of ACC suggest that patients at high risk of\nrecurrence (stage III, or R1-RX resection, and/or Ki-67 index\n>10%) should be offered adjuvant mitotane [IV, B].4 By\ncontrast, adjuvant therapy has to be discussed on an individual\nbasis in patients fulﬁlling all the following criteria: stage I or II\ndisease, histologicallyproven R0 resection and Ki-67expressed\nin \u000210% of neoplastic cells, which deﬁne the category of low\nrisk of recurrence [V, B] (Figure 1).4 For these patients, the\nresults of the still ongoing randomised ADIUVO trial55 testing\nthe efﬁcacy of adjuvant mitotane therapy are awaited.\nThere are no data regarding the optimal duration of\nadjuvant mitotane; however, the authors recommend that\nadjuvant mitotane should be administered for at least 2\nyears [V, B], because the greatest frequency of disease\nrecurrence is expected within this time frame. However, it is\nnot advised to continue adjuvant mitotane beyond 5 years,\ndue to the low number of ACC recurrences occurring after\nthis time [V, B].4\nAdjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is able to reduce the risk of\nlocal recurrence but does not prevent distant recurrences\nand, as a consequence, does not impact OS.4 Therefore, it is\nreasonable to associate mitotane with RT in selected pa-\ntients with stage III ACC and/or R1 or RX resection, although\nthe combination carries increased toxicity [IV, B].4\nThe adjuvant use of cytotoxic drugs is not well established\nin ACC. Nevertheless, some centres are beginning to apply\ncytotoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin plus etoposide) in selected\npatients with very high riskof recurrence and this approach is\nbeing investigated in a randomised trial (NCT03583710).\nSpecial considerations on mitotane. Mitotane is a difﬁcult\ndrug to manage, with a long half-life, dose-limiting toxicity\nand a narrow therapeutic window. Supplementary Table S7,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099\nsummarises the key features of mitotane therapy.\nPPGL. AsinACC,thesurgicalexcisionofthetumouristheﬁrst-\nline treatment of PPGLs (Figure 2). However, laparoscopic/\nminimal invasive surgery is commonly the technique of ﬁrst\nchoice for resection adrenal and extra-adrenal PPGLs [V, A],\nbecause local invasion is rare and the likelihood of rupture of\nthe capsule seems less common than in ACC. It is obvious,\nhowever,that the resection should be complete and if there is\nany risk that this cannot be achieved by laparoscopic surgery,\nan open approach should be carried out. In patients with\nPPGL, exposure to high levels of circulating catecholamines\nduring surgery could cause hypertensive crises and arrhyth-\nmias. Therefore, all patients with PPGL should receive pre-\noperative preparation at least 10-14 days before surgery [V,\nA].5 Blood pressure targets for the treatment are <130/80\nmmHg in the supine position, and a systolic blood pressure\npreferably >90 mmHg in the upright position. The noncom-\npetitive a-adrenoreceptor antagonist, phenoxybenzamine, is\ntraditionally the most frequently used adrenergic blocking\nagent. A standard starting dose is 10 mg twice daily with ad-\njustments over the following days. Alternatively, doxazosin, a\ncompetitive and selective a1-adrenoreceptor antagonist, can\nbe similarly effective. If the target blood pressure is not\nreached, calcium antagonists (slow-release nifedipine) or\nmetyrosine may be used. Blockade of b-adrenergic receptors\nis indicated in patients developing tachyarrhythmias but\nshould never be started before blockade of a-receptors.\nGiven the likelihood of rapid intraoperative haemody-\nnamic lability, continuous monitoring of arterial and central\nvenous pressures is essential throughout surgery. Although\ntoday’s volatile anaesthetics are not inductive of hyperten-\nsive crisis, such crises can be induced by other manipulations\nduring surgical procedure (e.g. intubation, insufﬂation of\nperitoneum, direct palpation of the PPGL) or administration\nof certain drugs (e.g. opioids, benzodiazepines).56 Therefore,\nit is strongly recommended that anaesthesia is supervised by\nan experienced anaesthesiologist alert to the diagnosis of a\ncatecholamine-producing tumour. Hypertension during sur-\ngery may be treated with magnesium sulfate, intravenous a-\nadrenoreceptor antagonists (e.g. phentolamine), calcium\nantagonists and/or nitroprusside or nitroglycerine. Tachy-\ncardia can be treated with intravenous b-adrenergic receptor\nblockers (e.g. esmolol). Postoperative hypotension should be\nprevented by saline infusion the day before surgery. If this\nadverse event occurs, it should be treated aggressively. In\ngeneral, sufﬁcient rehydration and treatment of constipation\nare important parts of the preoperative management. Post-\noperative care should also focus on glucose levels because\nhypoglycaemia may occur after reduction of catecholamine\nlevels. Cytoreductive debulking surgery (R2) in malignant\nphaeochromocytoma may improve QoL and survival by\nreducing tumour burden and controlling hormonal hyperse-\ncretion [V, B].3\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

In one series of 171\npatients followed up after surgical resection, 29 patients\n(17%) had recurrent or new tumours which were malignant\nin 15 cases (9%).6\nRecommendations\nACC\n\u0003 Complete en bloc resection of all adrenal tumours sus-\npected to be ACC by a surgeon experienced in adrenal\nand oncological surgery is the mainstay of a potentially\ncurative approach.

Most authors recommend\nonly annual measurement of metanephrines in most pa-\ntients, but some authors carry out additionally regular\nimaging.\nMANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE\nACC\nPrognosis of advanced ACC patients is limited, the 5-year OS\nbeing <15%. However, several studies have highlighted\nconsiderable heterogeneity in survival. Indeed, prolonged\nsurvival has been reported especially in patients with\nresectable oligometastatic disease, with long intervals be-\ntween recurrences.57,58\nIn general, ﬁrst-line therapy in patients with advanced/\nmetastatic disease is mitotane alone or mitotane plus\nchemotherapy (ChT). Surgery and locoregional therapies\nshould be adopted in addition to systemic therapy in\nselected patient populations (Figure 3). The goal of the\ntherapy is to control tumour growth, hypersecretion-related\nsymptoms and prolong survival.\nA study of the ENSAT network recently identiﬁed the\nprognostic factors in patients with advanced disease.\nAccordingly the stage, as redeﬁned by a modiﬁed ENSAT\n(mENSAT) classiﬁcation,37 which takes into account the\nnumber of tumoural organs, has a major prognostic role\ntogether with the following four parameters grouped under\nthe label GRAS: (i) tumour Grade, (ii) Resection status of the\nprimary tumour, (iii) Age, and (iv) tumour-related or\nhormone-related Symptoms. Based on these results, a risk\nstratiﬁcation was introduced.59 Although this new risk\nclassiﬁcation looks interesting, it needs conﬁrmation in\nother studies before being fully applicable in clinics.\nMitotane\nmonotherapy.\nMitotane\nis\nthe\nonly\ndrug\napproved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in\nlocally\nadvanced\ninoperable\nand\nmetastatic\npatients\n(supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099);\nnevertheless,\nrandomised\ncontrolled prospective trials are lacking. Response rates in\nmetastatic ACC vary between 13% and 35% but much of\nthese data are derived from retrospective series, including\nstudies in 1960s with overall variability in response criteria.4\nFor details on mitotane management, see above and\nsupplementary Table S7, available at https://doi.org/10.10\n16/j.annonc.2020.08.2099. Owing to the latency of mito-\ntane to attain the therapeutic range, mitotane mono-\ntherapy is indicated in the management of patients with a\nlow tumour burden and/or more indolent disease (i.e. pa-\ntients with favourable prognostic parameters). At disease\nprogression, ChT with etoposide, doxorubicin and cisplatin\n(EDP) should be added to mitotane monotherapy [I, A].\nCytotoxic ChT. The combination of EDP and mitotane (EDP-M)\nis recommended in ﬁrst-line settings based on the FIRM-ACT\ntrial results [I, A] (supplementary Table S8, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099 and Figure 3).\nIn the phase III randomised trial including 304 patients,\nprogression-free survival (PFS) was clearly superior in patients\ntreated with EDP-M compared with patients treated with\nstreptozocin plusmitotane[5.0versus2.1months,hazardratio\n(HR) 0.55, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.43-0.69, P < 0.001].60\nHowever, the difference in OS was not signiﬁcant (14.8 versus\n12.0months, HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.61-1.02,P ¼ 0.07), presumably\ndue to the crossover and presence of mitotane in both arms.\nInterestingly, a survival advantage of the EDP-M arm was\nobserved in patients, who could not receive the second-line\ntherapy. In patients unsuitable for EDP-M, mitotane in com-\nbination with etoposide and cisplatin [V, B],61 or mitotane plus\ncisplatin, is an option [V, B].62\nM. Fassnacht et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 11\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099\n1485\n\n---\nIn second-line settings, after failure of EDP-M, the treat-\nment options are limited63 and enrolment of patients into\nclinical trials should be considered ﬁrst. Most patients with\nadvanced ACC remain in good clinical condition but urgently\nseek therapy. In the absence of trials, possible options are the\nassociation of gemcitabine plus capecitabine64,65 or strepto-\nzocin (supplementary Table S8, available at https://doi.org/1\n0.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.2099).60 With both treatments, the\nmedian PFS is short, between 2 and 4 months. Mitotane\ntherapy is sometimes continued in association with second-\nline therapies. However, this must be discussed with the\npatient according to tolerance to the drug and its effect on\nhormonal secretion. The optimal timing to discontinue\nmitotane is debated and could be discussed with the patient\nindividually in cases of progressive disease despite ‘thera-\npeutic’ drug levels or highest tolerated doses assessed at two\ndistinct evaluations.\nSurgery and local therapies. Surgery, including surgery of\nthe primary tumour, may be recommended in all patients\nwith oligometastatic ACC if a complete resection of all\ntumoural lesions is feasible [V, B].4 Additionally, patients\nwith an indolent disease course or under therapeutic\ncontrol might be eligible for surgery. It is also worthwhile\nto consider surgery or other local therapies in all patients\nin whom systemic therapy led to an objective response\nor long-term stable disease [V, B].66,67 A cytoreductive\nresection may also be indicated in rare cases of severe\nsymptomatic hormone excess, after attempts to control\nthe symptoms with a combination of fast-acting anti-\nsecretory agents (i.e. metyrapone) and mitotane68 and\nlocal therapies [V, B]. In these patients, postoperative\nmitotane is clearly advised [V, A]. Local therapies [e.g. RT,\nchemoembolisation,\nradiofrequency\nablation\n(RFA)]\nshould also be discussed in all patients with advanced\noligometastatic ACC [V, B].4\nIn case of a recurrence following ACC surgery, two critical\nquestions must be addressed: (i) What is the time interval\nsince the resection? and (ii) Did recurrence occur during\nongoing mitotane therapy (with effective blood levels)? If the\ndisease-free interval is at least 12 months and another\ncomplete R0 resection/ablation seems feasible, then surgery\nor, alternatively, other local therapies are clearly recom-\nmended [IV, A].69,70 However, if this time interval is <6\nmonths orifcomplete resection/ablation is not feasible,then,\nthe EDP-M provides the treatment of choice, especially if the\nrecurrence occurred during ongoing mitotane treatment at\ntherapeutic levels [IV, A].\nMolecular-targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Several\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been investigated as\nsecond-line approaches in small phase II trials involving\nadvanced ACC (for review, see4,71). Results, however, have\nfailed to show signiﬁcant therapeutic efﬁcacy. In addition,\nthe insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor\nlinsitinib was tested in a multicentre placebo-controlled\nphase III trial (GALACTIC trial) and failed to improve\neither PFS or OS of advanced ACC patients who had already\nreceived systemic antineoplastic therapies.72\nThe results of the ﬁrst (small) trials with immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors in ACC were heterogeneous, with\nmedian PFS times of 1.8, 2.1, 2.6 and 6.75 months,\nrespectively.73-76 However, in one study with 39 patients,\ndisease control rate was 52% and median OS reached\nalmost 25 months, clearly suggesting that a least a subset of\npatients beneﬁts from this therapeutic approach.76\nManagement of hormone excess. In addition to sequelae\nof the malignant disease, patients with overt hyper-\ncortisolism suffer from immunosuppression, diabetes and\nmuscle weakness, which can signiﬁcantly impact QoL.\nSimilarly, severe androgen excess may dramatically impair\nwell-being in women. Therefore, medical therapy to control\nhormonal excess is recommended [V, A]. Mitotane is\nfrequently able to diminish steroid excess, but its efﬁcacy is\noften delayed by several weeks. In these circumstances,\nsteroidogenic enzyme inhibitors, such as metyrapone or\nketoconazole, can be useful [V, B]. Metyrapone is a well-\ntolerated drug and its metabolism and elimination are not\naltered by concomitant mitotane. Therefore, it can be safely\nadministered in association with mitotane and cytotoxic\nChT.68 Local therapies including liver embolisation may also\nbe discussed. All patients with clinically overt hormone\nexcess should be managed by physicians experienced with\nthese endocrine problems.\nPPGLs\nThe therapeutic strategy for metastatic PPGL primarily aims\nto control excessive catecholamine secretion and tumour\nburden, as there are no curative treatment options. Choices\nfor treatment include a watch-and-wait policy (including\nalpha blocker to control hypertension), locoregional thera-\npies,\nradiopharmaceutical\nagents,\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nmolecular-targeted therapies (Figure 4, supplementary\nTable S9, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2020.08.2099). Such choices should be discussed case by\ncase in a multidisciplinary specialised setting. In the absence\nof any published randomised trials and demonstrated\nimpact on survival, QoL for patients should always be\nconsidered in any justiﬁcation for a speciﬁc therapeutic\nintervention. Indeed, due to the indolent course of disease\nin some patients,77 an active surveillance policy may be\nindicated for those who are asymptomatic, have a low-to-\nintermediate tumour burden and absence of localised\ncomplications of any mass. In these patients, treatment-\nrelated adverse events may exceed any beneﬁt of therapy.\nSurgery. Although there is little possibility of a cure for\nmetastatic PPGLs, surgical resection of the primary tumour\nor metastatic lesions should be considered on a case-by-\ncase basis. Debulking surgery can improve symptoms and\npotentially prognosis by reducing secretion of catechol-\namines.78 Other local therapies are available for patients\nwith metastases, such as RT, RFA or chemoembolisation.\nLocal measures are also important to prevent bone-related\nevents.79 However, as with any invasive procedure, local\nablation may induce massive tumoural catecholamine\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Radionuclide therapy is an effective\ntreatment and [131I]MIBG is one of the most frequent ap-\nproaches with radionuclide doses ranging widely from 5.5\nto 38 GBq (150-1000 mCi). Approximately 50% of patients\nare eligible for [131I]MIBG therapy based on uptake from\ndiagnostic scans. Several studies have been published on\nthe efﬁcacy of [131I]MIBG treatment,3 mostly retrospective\nand only two prospective phase II trials.81,82 In both trials,\nobjective responses were observed in 23% of cases ac-\ncording to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours.\nLong-term survival of responders of over 6 years has been\nreported but progression at study entry was not a prereq-\nuisite for most studies. Objective responses were mainly\nobserved in patients with soft tissue metastases. Grade 3-4\ntoxicity was reported in 16%-83% of patients, mainly hae-\nmatological including myelodysplastic syndrome especially\nwith high activity doses.3,82 [131I]MIBG therapy could be\nconsidered as ﬁrst-line approach in patients displaying avid\nuptake of [123I]MIBG in all tumoural lesions who have\nunresectable, progressive PPGL or high tumour burden\n[III, A].\nAn alternative approach is a peptide receptor radioligand\ntherapy using somatostatin analogues labelled with iso-\ntopes delivering a cytotoxic radionuclide. More than 80% of\nPPGLs are detectable by somatostatin-based imaging.83 In\npatients with high uptake of PET tracers, such as gallium-68\n(68Ga)-labelled somatostatin analogues (e.g. [68Ga]DOTA-\nTATE or DOTATOC or DOTANOC), treatment with yttrium-\n90-labelled [90Y]DOTATOC or lutetium-177-labelled [177Lu]\nDOTATATE could be similarly effective as MIBG-based\ntherapy, although the number of published studies/case\nseries is limited [V, B].84 Both radionuclide approaches can\nbe applied repeatedly (with a minimum time interval of 3-4\nmonths). However, toxicity frequently becomes a limiting\nfactor over time and beneﬁt should be re-evaluated after\nevery second therapy.\nSystemic ChT. Systemic ChT might be considered as a ﬁrst-\nline treatment in patients with PPGL who have no signiﬁ-\ncant uptake of radiotracers or that are also rapidly pro-\ngressing and associated with high tumour burden or are\nhighly symptomatic [IV, B]. ChT with cyclophosphamide- and\ndacarbazine-based regimens combined with vincristine (CVD)\nand/or doxorubicin (CVDD or CDD) are the most studied\nregimens.85 In the largest published study to date (n ¼ 52\npatients), 40% of patients treated with CVD, CDD or CVDD\nexperienced clinical beneﬁt, including reduction in tumour\nsize in 25% of cases.86 Based on retrospective data, temozo-\nlomide, an oral alternative to dacarbazine, seems to be as\neffective as the previous polyChT regimens.87 These studies\nsuggest that patients with SDHB mutations are especially\nsensitive to temozolomide due to the association with\nhypermethylation of the promoter for O6-methylguanine-\nDNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Furthermore, recent case\nreports provide limited evidence that metronomic temozo-\nlomide is also effective as a second-line therapy.88\nTargeted therapies. There is a rationale and some evidence\non the potential efﬁcacy of antiangiogenic drugs in malig-\nnant\nphaeochromocytomas,\nespecially\nthose\nbearing\nSDHB gene mutations.89 Sunitinib is a potent TKI, including\nvascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs) 1\nand 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)\nbeta, KIT, FLT3 and RET, and has been the most-studied\ntargeted therapy in PPGL. In addition to several impres-\nsive case reports involving sunitinib, there is one retro-\nspective series with 17 patients with progressive metastatic\nPPGL.90 Of 14 evaluable patients, three had a partial\nresponse (21%) and ﬁve had stable disease (36%). Median\nPFS was 4.1 months and OS 27 months. As hypertension is\na key feature of PPGL and a major adverse event of suni-\ntinib, special attention is required to deal with this issue.\nThere are currently several ongoing trials on sunitinib\nincluding a randomised, placebo-controlled trial testing\nsunitinib in patients with malignant PPGL, now closed for\nrecruitment (FIRST-MAPPP trial, NCT01371201).\nA phase II study with pazopanib involving seven patients\n(study closed because of poor accrual) reported one\nconﬁrmed partial response (17%, duration 2.4 years) and\nmedian PFS and OS of 6.5 and 14.8 months, respectively.91\nRecommendations\nACC\n\u0003 In most patients with metastatic ACC, ﬁrst-line therapy\nwith mitotane alone or mitotane plus ChT is recommen-\nded; EDP-M is the ﬁrst-line treatment of choice [I, A].\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. low tumour burden and/or\nmore\nindolent\ndisease),\nmitotane\nmonotherapy\nis\nreasonable.\n\u0003 Surgery and locoregional therapies should be adopted in\naddition\nto\nsystemic\ntherapy\nin\nselected\npatient\npopulations.\n\u0003 Surgery is the treatment of choice only if all tumoural le-\nsions can be removed [V, B].\n\u0003 Local therapies (e.g. RT, RFA, cryoablation, microwave\nablation, chemoembolisation) are of value for therapy\nin advanced ACC, and an individualised treatment\napproach is required [V, B].\nPPGL\n\u0003 Although there are no curative treatment options, treat-\nment choices include watch-and-wait, locoregional ther-\napies, radiopharmaceutical agents, systemic ChT and\nmolecular-targeted therapies.\n\u0003 In selected patients (e.g. with low tumour burden\nwithout relevant symptoms), a watch-and-wait policy\n(including alpha blocker to control hypertension) is\npreferred.\n\u0003 In all patients with metastatic PPGL (debulking) surgery\nshould be considered.\nM.

In these guidelines, we follow the recom-\nmendations provided recently by other groups.4,9 For locally\nadvanced or metastatic disease, OS and time-to-progression\nare the most important end points, response rate and\ntreatment toxicity providing secondary end points. Time-to-\nprogression, ORR and treatment toxicity guide clinical\ndecision making in individual patients; they should be\nevaluated at regular intervals during treatment using CT\nscans and/or MRI and laboratory results (supplementary\nFile, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.08.\n2099). For patients opting for entirely palliative manage-\nment, no systematic imaging is advised. Information on\nlong-term implications, patient experience, psychological\nimplications and effect of rehabilitation is lacking for ACC\nand PPGL. At least, speciﬁc management of survivors should\nbe based on individual needs and preferences.\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines have been produced by\nESMO in partnership with EURACAN, the European Refer-\nence Network for rare adult solid cancers.

They help health pro-\nfessionals weigh the beneﬁts and the risks of available diagnostic\nor therapeutic options. Randomised clinical trial (RCT) data on\nthe management of thyroid cancer (TC) are relatively scarce, and\nthe quality of available evidence is suboptimal. Retrospective\nanalyses of treatment efﬁcacy frequently show favourable out-\ncomes, but it is difﬁcult to discern the extent to which these\nresults are due to the natural history of the disease. The number\nof cases retrospectively analysed is not an index of the quality of\nthe data or the absence of biases. Consequently, large, well-\nplanned RCTs managed within a network of coordinated centres\nare urgently needed.\nThe main goals of any cancer treatment are to improve overall\nsurvival (OS) and quality of life (QoL). Persistent disease in low-\nrisk TC patients is often associated with prolonged survival. The\nindolent behaviour of the tumours in these individuals—the vast\nmajority of the patients seen by clinicians—argues for the use of\nless aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches than those\nreserved for higher-risk patients. Therefore, clinical practice\nguidelines are also intended to provide oncologists with cost-\neffective strategies that will minimise the risks associated with\novertreatment.\nIncidence and epidemiology\nThe last three decades have witnessed steady, worldwide increases\nin the incidence of TC [1, 2]. Figures from the European Network\nof Cancer Registries show estimated incidence rates among\nfemales in 2012 that were approximately threefold higher than\nthose for males (9.3 and 3.1 cases per 100 000 person-years, re-\nspectively) [1]. Rates vary widely from country to country, with\nthe highest ﬁgures (per 100 000 person-years) reported in\nLithuania (15.5), Italy (13.5), Austria (12.4), Croatia (11.4) and\nLuxembourg (11.1). Estimated TC-related mortality rates, by\ncontrast, are low (0.7 and 0.5 cases per 100 000 person-years for\nwomen and men, respectively) with considerably less regional\nand temporal variation [3].\nThe rising incidence rates are almost entirely due to the\nincreased diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) and\npapillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) in particular. Incidence rates for\nfollicular (FTC), anaplastic (ATC) and medullary (MTC) thyroid\ncancers have remained relatively stable over the past 30 years. The\nexpanding use of imaging techniques, biopsy procedures [e.g.\nﬁne-needle aspiration (FNA)] and medical surveillance, along\nwith improved access to healthcare, has facilitated the detection\nof small, subclinical PTCs [4]. The resulting overdiagnosis has in-\nvariably been accompanied by overtreatment [5]. According to\nthe United States Preventive Services Task Force, the risks associ-\nated with TC screening in asymptomatic adults are likely to\nV\nC The Author(s) 2019.

Support is also growing for\nmore conservative, risk-tailored strategies for TC management\n(including watchful waiting) [7–10].\nDTC and poorly differentiated TC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nThe diagnostic work-up of DTCs (including poorly differentiated\nforms) comprises pre- and postoperative pathological and mo-\nlecular assessments. Preoperative FNA for cytology is not\nrequired for nodules measuring \u00021 cm. Decisions to aspirate\nlarger nodules should be guided by lesion size and sonographic\nappearance [8]. Cytology ﬁndings are classiﬁed into diagnostic\ncategories associated with different risks of malignancy [11].\nMost malignant thyroid tumours can be identiﬁed cytologically.\nNotable exceptions are FTCs and the newly deﬁned ‘non-invasive\nfollicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features’\n(NIFTP), which are usually classiﬁed as indeterminate in the vari-\nous thyroid cytology reporting schemes [12]. FNA-based diagno-\nsis of poorly differentiated carcinoma is also challenging unless\nthere is obviously increased mitotic activity and/or necrosis. FNA\ndiagnosis can be facilitated by assessment of malignancy markers\n(including proteins commonly overexpressed in tumours, e.g.\nHBME1 or galectin-3) and molecular alterations speciﬁcally asso-\nciated with malignancy (e.g. BRAF mutations, RET fusions, other\nnovel gene alterations). Speciﬁcally designed gene panels are re-\nportedly useful for identifying malignancy when cytology sam-\nples are morphologically indeterminate [13].\nResected DTCs are histologically classiﬁed according to the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) criteria (updated in 2017—\nTable 1). Based on clinical evidence of their low-grade behaviour\nduring long-term follow-up, encapsulated non-invasive follicular\nPTC variants are now referred to as NIFTPs. They account for up\nto 20% of cases in Europe [14]. Elimination of the term ‘carcin-\noma’ from the deﬁnition of this PTC variant underscores its ex-\ncellent prognosis: NIFTP is associated with no reports of cancer-\nrelated deaths and an estimated risk of recurrence of <1%. This\nnew entity shows partial overlap with the group of tumours\ndeﬁned in Europe as ‘well-differentiated tumours of uncertain\nmalignant potential’ [15]. Diagnosis of NIFTP requires a scrupu-\nlous pathological examination of the follicular-pattern nodule to\nconﬁdently exclude the presence of capsular invasion (even\nmicroscopic) and papillary formations. RAS but not BRAF muta-\ntions characterise NIFTPs. Correct identiﬁcation of NIFTPs\nshould reduce the unnecessary use of radical surgical procedures\nand the needless administration of radioactive iodine (RAI) after\na completion thyroidectomy. NIFTP follow-up strategies should\nmimic those of very-low risk carcinomas (see following sections).\nThere are numerous other PTC variants, including some that are\nparticularly aggressive and associated with higher tumour stages\nand lymph node metastases at diagnosis. The best-known of these\nare the tall cell, columnar, hobnail and solid variants [16, 17].\nThe WHO currently recommends reporting FTCs as ‘minimal-\nly invasive’ when capsular penetration is present without vascular\ninvolvement (a condition associated with an extremely good\nprognosis). The terms ‘angioinvasive’ and ‘widely invasive’\nshould be reserved for follicular cancers with neoplastic emboli\ninvolving <4 or \u00034 blood vessels, respectively.\nThe diagnostic criteria for poorly differentiated carcinomas re-\nmain controversial. A consensus conference in 2006 yielded the\nTurin proposal [18], which restricts this diagnosis to invasive\ntumours with a solid/trabecular/insular growth pattern plus at\nleast one of the following:\n• mitotic index \u00033 per 10 high-power ﬁelds;\n• necrosis;\n• convoluted nuclei (slightly smaller and darker than those typ-\nically seen in PTC, with irregular contours).\nThis deﬁnition delimits a category of TCs that behave aggres-\nsively while maintaining some degree of functional differenti-\nation [e.g. thyroglobulin (Tg) production].\nHu¨rthle cell carcinomas are no longer classiﬁed as ‘follicular\ntumours’, which are generally much less aggressive and less likely\nto present with lymph node metastases [16]. Hu¨rthle cell carcino-\nmas associated with extensive vascular and/or capsular invasion\nshould be managed like other high-risk carcinomas (see following\nsections). ‘Pure’ Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas (i.e., those with a\nHu¨rthle-cell component exceeding 75%) also present molecular\nabnormalities that distinguish them from conventional follicular\ncarcinomas. As for oncocytic PTCs and oncocytic variants of\npoorly differentiated carcinomas, they are no more aggressive\nthan their conventional counterparts.\nMolecular proﬁling has distinguished two major classes of PTCs\ncharacterised by BRAF-predominant and RAS-predominant mo-\nlecular signatures (Table 1) [19]. BRAF V600E mutations are fre-\nquently reported in a subgroup of PTCs with more aggressive\nclinicopathological behaviours, but the need for routine BRAF gen-\notyping of PTCs has not been established. The fatal forms of non-\nATC are generally PTC variants harbouring BRAF or RAS\nmutations plus other genomic alterations (e.g. mutations involving\nthe TERT promoter, TP53, POLE, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway\neffectors, SWI/SNF subunits and/or histone methyltransferases),\nsome of which are potential therapeutic targets [20]. The molecular\nproﬁles of follicular and Hu¨rthle cell carcinomas are less well-\ndeﬁned. Work is underway to deﬁne the genomic and transcrip-\ntomic proﬁles of poorly differentiated and anaplastic TCs [21, 22].\nStaging and risk assessment\nMortality risk. The Union for International Cancer Control\n(UICC) tumour, node, metastasis (TNM) classiﬁcation of malig-\nnant tumours stages lesions based on their mortality risks. The\neighth edition [23] introduced important changes for thyroid\ntumours, including the downstaging of extrathyroidal extension\nthat is not macroscopically evident (pT3b) (Table 2). Primaries\nwith extrathyroidal spread that is exclusively microscopic are\nnow staged solely on the basis of tumour size as pT1, pT2 or\npT3a. TNM staging requires a complete review of prognostically\nrelevant morphological and immune-phenotypic parameters\n[20]. A checklist containing these parameters can be included in\nthe ﬁnal pathology report [IV, A] to supply details on the extent\nof invasion (capsular versus vascular, including number of\naffected vessels), tumour size and architecture, presence of necro-\nsis, proliferative activity, etc. [10].\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1857\n\n---\nRisk of persistent or recurrent disease. Table 3 summarises the\nsystem developed in 2015 by the American Thyroid Association\n(ATA) to estimate the risk of persistent or recurrent TC based on\ndata available shortly after treatment of the primary cancer\n[8, 24–26]. These criteria have now been revised and reﬁned\nbased on emerging evidence. The likelihood of persistent/recur-\nrent disease after an apparently complete resection depends on\nseveral factors. The overall estimated risk of recurrence ranges\nfrom <1% to 55% and is classiﬁed as low (\u00025%), intermediate\n(6%–20%) or high (>20%). A high-quality pathology report is\ncrucial for proper risk stratiﬁcation.\nThe initial risk class assignment is revised during follow-up to\nreﬂect the evolution of the disease and responses to treatments\n(dynamic\nrisk\nstratiﬁcation)\n[IV,\nA]\n[27–30].\nTreatment\nresponses are deﬁned as excellent, biochemical incomplete, struc-\ntural incomplete or indeterminate based on imaging ﬁndings >\n[mainly neck ultrasound (US)] and serum Tg and anti-Tg anti-\nbody (TgAb) levels (see Table 4) [8].\nPrimary tumour management\nSurgery. Primary tumour management will be determined by the\nresults of the preoperative risk assessment (Figure 1). Active US\nsurveillance of the thyroid and neck lymph nodes (every 6–\n12 months) can be proposed for unifocal papillary microcarcino-\nmas (\u000210 mm) with no evidence of extracapsular extension or\nlymph node metastases [III, B] [31]. In these cases, the only\nknown predictor of signiﬁcant tumour growth (\u00033 mm) or the\nonset of lymph node metastasis is age (10-year estimated risks:\n36% in patients <30 years old, 14% in those aged 30–50, 6% in\npatients 50–60 years old) [32].\nFor other TCs, total thyroidectomy is still considered the stand-\nard surgical treatment. Two large database studies on surgical man-\nagement strategies found that, for selected low-risk tumours (T1a–\nT1b–T2, N0), lobectomy alone does not reduce OS [IV, B] [33,\n34], but it may be associated with a slightly higher local recurrence\n[8]. However, even large database studies are subject to biases. In\nrisk-beneﬁt analyses, it is important to recall that total thyroidec-\ntomy can cause recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.5%, bilateral in\nrare cases) and temporary or permanent hypoparathyroidism\n(8.1%) [35]. The risk (even when done by high-volume surgeons)\nis almost twice that of lobectomy alone, and postoperative compli-\ncations are generally more likely with low-volume surgeons [36].\nThe use of prophylactic central neck dissection for low-risk\ntumours (T1b–T2, N0) varies from centre to centre [IV, C]\n[37–39]. Evidence of its effect on recurrence-free survival is con-\nﬂicting, and there is no high-level evidence for or against its use-\nfulness for low-risk tumours. Studies supporting prophylactic\nneck dissection for low-risk tumours have shown moderate\nreductions in central neck recurrence (5%–10%) but no im-\nprovement in OS. Prophylactic neck dissection does allow more\ncomplete staging of neck nodes, including identiﬁcation of\nmicrometastases not visible on preoperative US, and this infor-\nmation can be used to reﬁne the prognosis and guide subsequent\ntreatment and follow-up. Risks, however, include temporary\nhypoparathyroidism and overdiagnosis and overtreatment of\nsubclinical micrometastases. The potential beneﬁts of prophylac-\ntic neck dissection for low-risk tumours are now being evaluated\nin an RCT (NCT03570021—ESTIMABL3). For more invasive\ntumours (T3–T4), prophylactic neck dissection may improve re-\ngional control [IV, C] [40].\nRAI therapy. RAI is administered after total thyroidectomy for\nseveral reasons:\n• to eliminate the normal thyroid remnant, thereby ensuring\nundetectable serum Tg levels (in the absence of neoplastic tis-\nsue), which facilitate follow-up (remnant ablation);\n• to irradiate presumed foci of neoplastic cells, thereby reduc-\ning the recurrence risk (adjuvant therapy); and/or\nTable 1.

Some authors consider it a more aggressive form of DTC. When associated with extensive vascular and/or capsular invasion,\nthe recurrence risk should be classiﬁed as high. For minimally invasive Hu¨rthle cell carcinoma, robust data are lacking on the true risk of recurrence.\nfThe BRAF V600E mutation is associated with aggressive histologic features, lymph node metastases and ETE, but its relative contribution to the risk of recur-\nrence is not well-deﬁned. Co-existing BRAF V600E and TERT mutations act synergically to increase the risk of recurrence [25, 26].\n131I, iodine-131; ATA, American Thyroid Association; DTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; ERR, estimated risk of recurrence; ETE, extrathyroidal extension; FTC,\nfollicular thyroid cancer; NIFTP, non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features; PTC, papillary thyroid cancer; RAI, radioactive\niodine; Tg, thyroglobulin; WHO, World Health Organization.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1860 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\n• to treat persistent or recurrent disease (treatment of known\ndisease) [8].\nIn all three cases, RAI administration must be followed by an\niodine-131 (131I) whole-body scan (WBS) to stage the disease\nand document the 131I avidity of any structural lesion. The esti-\nmated level of risk for persistent/recurrent disease will deter-\nmine whether and how much RAI is given. Low activities are\nusually given for remnant ablation (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq); high\nactivities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) are used for treatment pur-\nposes. To optimise isotope uptake, RAI should be given after\nthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation, which can be\nachieved by withdrawing levothyroxine for 4–5 weeks, ideally\nuntil serum TSH levels reach \u000330 mIU/ml. Alternatively, re-\ncombinant human TSH (rhTSH) can be given (two daily injec-\ntions of 0.9 mg of rhTSH followed by RAI on day 3). The\nresulting TSH level is not usually measured (unless doubts arise\nas to whether the injections have been properly administered).\nLevothyroxine withdrawal is preferred if distant metastases are\npresent. The use of rhTSH is associated with superior short-\nterm QoL [41].\nAs shown in Figure 2, practice guidelines unanimously recom-\nmend treatment with high RAI activities (\u0003100 mCi, 3.7 GBq)\nfor patients with high risk of recurrence [IV, A] [7–10, 42]. RAI\nadministration is not recommended for certain low-risk patients\n[i.e. those with a small (\u00021 cm) intrathyroidal DTC and no evi-\ndence of locoregional metastases] [II, E] [43]. The term ‘very\nlow-risk’ is often applied to these patients in the literature [7, 44].\nThere is less consensus regarding other low-risk DTC patients\n[IV, C] (see Table 3). In 2015, the ATA guidelines advised against\nthe systematic use of RAI in the latter group [8]. However, the\nEuropean Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) has not\nendorsed this recommendation [45], mainly because prospective\nRCT data showing that surveillance is non-inferior to RAI ad-\nministration are lacking. The ATA, the EANM, the Society of\nNuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (SNMMI) and the\nEuropean Thyroid Association (ETA) have recently published a\njoint statement acknowledging the absence of high-quality evi-\ndence either for or against the postoperative use of 131I in low-\nrisk patients [46]. They conclude that decisions should be taken\non an individual basis, depending on tumour features (e.g. risk of\nrecurrence) (see Table 3), patient-related factors (e.g. comorbid-\nities, motivation, emotional concerns), health-care setting (e.g.\navailability and quality of thyroid surgeons, US, RAI imaging, Tg\nassays) and the local management team’s preferences. Lastly, the\nexpected beneﬁts of a given RAI dose should outweigh the risks\nassociated with its administration, which include adverse events\n(AEs) and diminished QoL [43]. The usefulness of 131I therapy in\nlow-risk TC patients is now being assessed in two large RCTs\n(NCT01837745—ESTIMABL2,\nNCT01398085—IoN).\nTwo\nother RCTs (ESTIMABL1 and HiLo) conducted in low-risk DTC\npopulations showed that, if RAI is given in these cases, low activ-\nities (30 mCi, 1.1 GBq) following rhTSH and high activities\n(100 mCi, 3.7 GBq) following levothyroxine withdrawal are\nequally likely to produce successful ablation [I, A] [47, 48]. This\nequivalence is also evident at the level of recurrence-free survival,\nTable 4.

In\nthese patients, the ATA recommends individualised decision\nmaking [8].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up tools and schedules (Figure 3) vary according to the\ntumour histotype, initial treatment, initial risk of persistent/re-\ncurrent disease (Table 3) and responses to treatment (Table 4).\nSerum Tg assays and neck US are the mainstays of DTC follow-\nup [51]. Patient management can be improved when health pro-\nfessionals collaborate as members of a multidisciplinary team.\nSerum Tg. Serum Tg is a sensitive marker for the presence of thy-\nrocytes, but it cannot discriminate between normal and\nmalignant cells. Undetectable levels thus have high negative pre-\ndictive values, but detectable values can be false-positives. To\nminimise variability, Tg levels should ideally be measured with\nthe same assay [52]. Concomitant assessment of serum TgAb is\nmandatory, as these antibodies can interfere with Tg assays, caus-\ning false-negative or, less commonly, false-positive results [53].\nSerum Tg can be assayed under basal conditions (i.e. during levo-\nthyroxine treatment) or after endogenous (levothyroxine with-\ndrawal) or exogenous (rhTSH injection) TSH stimulation. In\npatients treated with total thyroidectomy plus RAI remnant abla-\ntion, stimulated serum Tg levels <1 ng/ml are highly predictive of\nan excellent response to therapy, and subsequent stimulated Tg\nassays are unnecessary [54]. High-sensitivity (<0.2 ng/ml) assays\nof basal Tg levels can also be used to verify the absence of disease\n(excellent response) [II, B] [55]. If negative imaging ﬁndings are\naccompanied by detectable Tg levels, the treatment response is\nclassiﬁed as indeterminate or biochemical incomplete (Table 4).\nIn this case, the positive predictive value increases with the serum\nTg level or, if serial measurements are available, with levels that\nincrease over time. Almost 60% of patients who have total thyroi-\ndectomy without postoperative RAI administration will have\nbasal serum Tg levels \u00020.2 ng/ml [56, 57], which indicates an\nDTC \nafter TT ± neck dissection\nTherapeutic\nResidual disease (incomplete surgery, M1)\nRAI-refractory diseasea\n1.

When\nserum Tg levels are detectable, serial measurements of Tg should\nbe obtained on levothyroxine treatment [IV, B] [56, 57]. A simi-\nlar approach might be used following lobectomy [IV, C] [28].\nIncreasing Tg levels are highly suspicious for persistent/recurrent\nDTC, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nNeck US. Neck US is the most effective tool for detecting struc-\ntural disease in the neck, particularly when remnants of normal\nthyroid tissue are present. Combined with the results of FNA cy-\ntology [58] and serum Tg assays, neck US ﬁndings can achieve an\naccuracy of nearly 100% [59]. The shortcomings of US include\nsubstantial operator dependency [60], a high frequency of non-\nspeciﬁc ﬁndings [61] and the possibility of unsatisfactory visual-\nisation of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by\nbone or air. The latter sites are better explored with cross-\nsectional imaging modalities (see below). Abnormal US ﬁndings\ncan be classiﬁed as indeterminate or truly suspicious (Table 5)\n[62, 63]. Unlike PTC, FTC metastasis is typically haematogenous\nand rarely involves the locoregional lymph nodes, so neck US in\nthese cases serves mainly to exclude residual/recurrent thyroid-\nbed disease.\nOther imaging studies.

Recommendations for postoperative management of DTC patients.\naIsolated measurements of serum Tg cannot be reliably interpreted in the presence of normal thyroid tissue. The trend over time of basal Tg\nshould be used in patients with residual thyroid tissue and might also be used in case of lobectomy. Rising Tg is highly suspicious for persist-\nent/recurrent disease, and the same may be true for rising TgAb levels.\nbHighly sensitive (<0.2 ng/ml) assays of basal Tg can be used in lieu of TSH-stimulated Tg to verify the absence of disease.\ncIn patients with serum TSH level of 0.5–2 mIU/ml after lobectomy, levothyroxine replacement therapy is not mandatory.\ndIn patients with excellent response to therapy, repeat neck US may be avoided.\neShort serum Tg doubling time (<1 year) is associated with poor outcome in DTC patients [72] and should prompt imaging staging.\nfShort tumour growth doubling time (<1 year) may guide the choice of starting a treatment [95].\ngIf FDG is normal, WBS can be carried out after the administration of a therapeutic activity.\nDTC, differentiated thyroid cancer; FDG, ﬂuorodeoxyglucose; FDG–PET, [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomography;\nON-LT4-Tg, thyroglobulin measurement on levothyroxine; q x months, every x months; RAI, radioactive iodine; rhTSH, recombinant human\nthyroid stimulating hormone; RRA, radioiodine remnant ablation; RxWBS, therapeutic whole-body iodine-131 scan; Tg, thyroglobulin; TgAb,\nserum thyroglobulin antibody; TSH, thyroid stimulating hormone; TT, total thyroidectomy; US, ultrasound; WBS, whole-body scan.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1864 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nTgAb levels in the absence of sonographically identiﬁable neck\ndisease or in patients with intermediate-to-high risks of persist-\nent/recurrent disease, irrespective of the neck US ﬁndings)\n[IV, B] [8].\nA WBS can be carried out after the administration of diagnostic\nor therapeutic doses of RAI. Because its sensitivity is low (27%–\n55%), diagnostic WBS is not indicated during follow-up [IV, A]\n[64]. Uptake is highly speciﬁc (91%–100%) for the presence of\nthyroid tissue, but false-positive results are possible. In these cases,\nsingle-photon emission computed tomography or computed\ntomography (CT) offers better anatomic resolution [64].\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose—positron emission tomog-\nraphy (FDG–PET) combined with CT is useful for assessing the\nextent of disease and deﬁning the prognosis [65, 66]. Its sensitiv-\nity is around 94%, and speciﬁcity is between 80% and 84%.\nFDG–PET is more sensitive than therapeutic WBS for detecting\npersistent disease in patients with negative cross-sectional imag-\ning studies, serum Tg levels >10 ng/dl, and/or aggressive histo-\ntypes (e.g. aggressive PTC, poorly differentiated TC, widely\ninvasive follicular carcinoma) [67]. FDG uptake is associated\nwith a worse prognosis and refractoriness to RAI treatment [68,\n69], but it is not a reliable predictor of tumour growth [70].\nFDG–PET is the ﬁrst-line isotopic imaging technique for patients\nwith RAI-refractory disease.\nCross-sectional imaging modalities should be chosen on\nthe basis of the anatomic region to be explored. CT is best for\nneck and chest imaging. Contrast enhancement is used for\nstudies of the neck and mediastinal lymph nodes but not\nfor the lungs. All forms of RAI treatment should be deferred\nfor at least 6 weeks after administration of any iodinated con-\ntrast medium. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imag-\ning (MRI) is appropriate for exploring the neck, liver,\nbones and brain [64]. MRI of the neck is subject to\nsubstantial image degradation due to respiratory motion,\nand a CT scan is often a better alternative. Suspected\naerodigestive-tract involvement should always be assessed\nendoscopically.\nFollow-up strategies. All patients with DTC should have neck US\nand serum Tg and TgAb assays 6–18 months after primary\ntreatment (surgery 6 RAI therapy). The subsequent follow-up\nschedule will depend on the initially estimated risk of persistent/\nrecurrent disease and responses to therapy (Figure 3).\nPTC patients at low risk for recurrence who have no evidence\nof structural disease at the ﬁrst follow-up visit can be monitored\nwith periodic (12–24 months) Tg and TgAb assessments. Repeat\nneck US scans can be carried out as needed, depending on serum\nTg and TgAb levels [71]. The same schedule can be adopted for\nintermediate-risk PTC patients with excellent responses to treat-\nment [IV, A] [27, 30, 44]. TSH levels should be maintained in the\nlow-normal range (0.5–2 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. The follow-up\nprotocol for minimally invasive FTCs is often the same one used\nfor low-risk PTCs, although the evidence supporting such an ap-\nproach is insufﬁcient [V, C] [24].\nLow- or intermediate-risk PTC patients with a biochemical in-\ncomplete or indeterminate response to treatment should have\nserum Tg and TgAb assays and a neck US every 6–12 months.\nRising Tg or TgAb levels warrant further imaging studies [72].\nMild TSH suppression should be considered (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) in\npatients at intermediate risk of recurrence [IV, B] [8].\nIn patients with high-risk PTCs, poorly differentiated TCs or\nwidely invasive FTCs, serum Tg and TgAb levels should be\nassessed every 6–12 months if the response to therapy is excellent\nor biochemical indeterminate/incomplete. Cross-sectional or\nfunctional imaging studies should be repeated if detectable Tg\nlevels persist [IV, B] [27, 30]. For patients whose recurrence risk\nis initially classiﬁed as high, a more in-depth imaging work-up\nmay be advisable even if serum Tg levels remain or become un-\ndetectable, as the absence of the circulating Tg may simply reﬂect\nthe dedifferentiation of any residual tumour tissue that might be\npresent [8]. Serum TSH levels should be suppressed in all patients\nwith biochemical incomplete or indeterminate responses to treat-\nment (0.1–0.5 mIU/ml) [IV, B] [8]. Patients with structural in-\ncomplete responses can be placed on active surveillance or\nreferred for local or systemic treatments.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nDistant metastases occur in fewer than 10% of patients with\nDTC. Half are present when the tumour is ﬁrst discovered; the\nothers are found later, sometimes decades after initial treatment.\nMetastases are observed most frequently in patients with aggres-\nsive histological subtypes (e.g. tall-cell, hobnail, solid, diffuse\nsclerosing and columnar-cell variants): vascular invasion, large\nprimary tumours, macroscopic extrathyroidal extension, bulky\nlocoregional nodal disease [8]. The most common sites are lungs\nand bones (involved in 49% and 25% of all cases, respectively),\nand in 15% of cases, both are affected [73]. Bone metastases are\nmore common in FTC than in PTC (55.5% versus 31.5%, re-\nspectively). Spinal (34.6%) and pelvic (25.5%) bones are the\nmost frequently involved, followed by those of the chest (18.3%),\nextremities\n(10.2%),\nshoulder\ngirdle\n(5.4%)\nand\nthe\nTable 5.

Brain, liver and skin in-\nvolvement is less common. The overall mortality rates 5 and\n10 years after diagnosis of distant metastases are 65% and 75%,\nrespectively [75].\nDistant metastases are usually diagnosed because of clinical\nsymptoms or suspicious imaging/laboratory ﬁndings (abnormal\nuptake on a post-ablation WBS, or a positive ﬁnding on an FDG–\nPET-CT scan or a cross-sectional study prompted by elevated Tg\nlevels in patients whose post-ablation WBS is negative).\nRAI therapy. Patients with distant metastases should receive 100–\n200 mCi (3.7–7.4 GBq) of 131I after TSH stimulation [IV, A] [73].\nThe latter can be achieved with levothyroxine withdrawal or, if\nwithdrawal is clinically contraindicated or the patients has hypo-\npituitarism, with injections of rhTSH (Figure 2). One-third of\npatients have lesions that are not RAI-avid and are considered\nRAI-refractory [IV, A] (Figure 2) [73, 76]. If the distant metasta-\nses are RAI-avid, 131I is administered every 6 months for 2 years\nand less frequently thereafter. Between treatments, suppressive\ndoses of levothyroxine are given to maintain serum TSH levels\nbelow 0.1 mIU/ml (unless there are speciﬁc contraindications)\n[III, B] [77–79]. Data from some prospective cohort studies sug-\ngest that disease progression, recurrence and death rates are\nreduced in patients undergoing TSH suppression for structurally\nidentiﬁable disease [77, 79], but it is still unclear how much sup-\npression is appropriate [78]. Between treatments, efﬁcacy should\nbe veriﬁed with periodic cross-sectional imaging studies.\nCompared with repeated administrations of standard doses of\nRAI (100 mCi or 3.7 GBq), use of higher, dosimetrically deter-\nmined activities appears to offer no beneﬁts in terms of OS [80].\nWhen distant metastases lose their ability to concentrate RAI or\nstructural progression occurs within 6–12 months after RAI ad-\nministration, the disease is considered RAI-refractory [IV, A]\n(Figure 2) [73, 76]. A cure is unlikely if lesions persist after ad-\nministration of a cumulative dose of 600 mCi 131I, and decisions\non whether to continue RAI therapy will be based on tumour\nburden, RAI-uptake intensity and responses to previous RAI\nadministrations [73].\nOverall, one out of three patients with distant metastases will\nbe cured with RAI and have a near-normal life expectancy [73].\nThese are usually young individuals with well-differentiated TC\nand small non-FDG-avid metastatic lesions. The other patients\nwill at some point be classiﬁed as RAI-refractory; the prognosis in\nthese cases will vary, depending mainly on the tumour burden\nand growth rate. Overall, their 5-year survival is <50%. RAI re-\nfractoriness, however, remains uncommon, with an estimated in-\ncidence of 4–5 cases per million population. Drugs for re-\ninducing or increasing RAI uptake by the tumours are currently\nunder investigation. The selective kinase inhibitors dabrafenib\n[81], vemurafenib [82] and selumetinib [83] can reportedly re-\nstore RAI uptake and tumour responses in selected patients, espe-\ncially in those with small tumour burden and low progression\nrate. Several trials are underway to validate these preliminary data\n(NCT03244956, NCT02456701, NCT02145143, NCT02152995,\nNCT03363347), but thus far, none of the three drugs has been\napproved for this indication.\nLocoregional therapy. Several locoregional approaches can be\nused to treat TC. The data and indications discussed below,\nhowever, are based mainly on studies of other solid tumours.\nSpeciﬁc recommendations are lacking for DTC or MTC patients;\ntherefore, the indications for locoregional treatments of these\ntumours will be discussed together. ATC patients will be dis-\ncussed separately, as their poor prognosis is a major factor in all\ntreatment decisions.\nBone metastases: The relatively long survival perspective places\nTC patients with bone metastases at high risk of skeletal-related\nevents (SREs), i.e. pathological fractures, spinal cord compres-\nsion, need for radiation (for pain or impending fracture) or sur-\ngery and hypercalcaemia. Up to 37% of TC patients experience\nSREs, and they are associated with poorer prognoses [84, 85].\nThere is a strong rationale and some clinical data supporting\nthe roles for bone resorption inhibitors (bisphosphonates or\ndenosumab) [V, B], external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or other\nlocoregional treatments in reducing SREs [86]. Bisphosphonates\nand denosumab have each been shown to decrease SRE rates and\nbone pain associated with breast, prostate and lung cancers.\nInhibition of bone resorption should be considered in TC\npatients with multiple bone metastases. Treatment can be admin-\nistered every 4 weeks (bisphosphonates and denosumab) or every\n3 months (bisphosphonates). The optimal duration of treatment\nis unknown, but in other more thoroughly studied tumours (e.g.\nbreast, prostate, lung), a minimum of 2 years is recommended.\nAdequate calcium and vitamin D levels should be maintained\nduring treatment. The most signiﬁcant AE of these drugs is jaw\nosteonecrosis, and the risk is increased in patients receiving\nantiangiogenic therapy [87]. A baseline dental evaluation is\nthus mandatory before starting treatment with bone resorption\ninhibitors, and regular checkups are recommended during\ntreatment.\nIf the bone metastases are RAI-avid, RAI therapy may control\nthe disease for some time and alleviate or delay symptoms, but it\nis unlikely to eliminate these lesions. Locoregional treatments\nmay allow longer progression-free intervals and even cures in\npatients with targetable, oligometastatic bone disease. Surgery\nfollowed by EBRT is associated with the best outcomes, at least\nfor limb lesions [88]. If surgery is not feasible, bone lesions associ-\nated with pain or a high fracture risk should be treated with frac-\ntionated (20 Gy in ﬁve fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions) or\nsingle-fraction (8 Gy) EBRT and/or with interventional radiology\ntechniques, including cementoplasty and thermal ablation [89].\nFor spinal cord compression in a patient whose life expectancy\nexceeds 6 months, longer fractionation schedules (e.g. 30 Gy in 10\nfractions over 2 weeks) are recommended. If the life expectancy is\n\u00026 months, a single fraction of 8 or 20 Gy in ﬁve fractions should\nbe used to minimise hospitalisation [II, B] [90].\nPercutaneous vertebroplasty can reduce the pain and deform-\nity associated with vertebral body fractures. The efﬁcacy of this\ninnovative approach has not been directly compared with surgery\nand should only be done in high-volume centres to minimise the\nrisk of complications (e.g. cement leakage outside the bone).\nThere is limited evidence that other conservative techniques\n[radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryotherapy] are effective for\ntreating TC-related bone lesions [V, B] [91].\nPalliative EBRT alleviates pain and neurological complications.\nPain relief is often achieved 48–72 h after treatment, although it\nmay take up to 1 month.\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1866 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nLung metastases: The lung is a common site of TC metastasis.\nThe lesions are usually multiple, bilateral, of varying size (from a\nfew millimetres to 1 cm) and asymptomatic. Metastasectomy is\nnot the standard approach for these lesions, but it may be consid-\nered for oligometastasis in patients with good performance status\n(PS) [V, C]. RFA is also a possibility for solitary lesions or those\ncausing a speciﬁc symptom due to their volume and location [V,\nC]. RFA is considered for lesions <2–3 cm in patients not eligible\nfor surgery or those requiring an extensive resection [92].\nLiver metastases: Liver metastases are rare in DTC but more\ncommon in MTC. Liver involvement usually presents with mul-\ntiple lesions, but if true solitary lesions are detected, they may be\ncandidates for local ablation. In MTC patients with a dominant\nlesion that is growing more rapidly than the background dis-\nease, local ablation (e.g. RFA) may be useful for controlling\nsymptoms, systemic ones in particular, such as diarrhoea. The\noutcome of RFA will depend on the size of the lesion (optimally\n<30 mm), its location (at least 3 mm from all vessels) and its\nvisibility on US. Direct comparisons of surgery and RFA are\nlacking. In general, individuals who are ineligible for surgery are\nnot the best candidates for percutaneous ablation. If both sur-\ngery and RFA are contraindicated, hepatic intra-arterial embol-\nisation with drug-eluting beads might be an option: it has been\nused in other solid tumours [93] but its efﬁcacy in TC has not\nbeen validated.\nInvasion of upper aerodigestive tract: Invasion of the upper\naerodigestive tract should always be excluded in TC patients with\nlocoregional disease. Suspicious symptoms include haemoptysis\nand dysphagia. Contrast-enhanced CT and/or MRI are helpful\nfor exploring suspicious cases, although endoscopy is more de-\nﬁnitive. In selected cases (e.g. bleeding, exophytic lesions), local\ntreatment (e.g. laser excision) is advisable before starting antian-\ngiogenic multikinase inhibitor (MKI) therapy.\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. TSH suppression\n(serum level <0.1 lIU/ml) is recommended for all TC patients\nwith persistent structural disease in the absence of speciﬁc contra-\nindications [III, B] [77].

Temporal trends in the levels of\nserum tumour markers (e.g. Tg doubling time) can be used to\nsupport and help decision making [95]. Importantly, however,\nan increase in serum Tg levels in the absence of radiologically evi-\ndent disease progression should not be used to select patients\nrequiring systemic therapy. A complete cross-sectional imaging\nassessment of the extent of the disease is mandatory for any treat-\nment decisions. RECIST v1.1 are used to deﬁne target lesions and\nmeasure responses to systemic treatment [94]. The imaging as-\nsessment should be repeated every 3–12 weeks during treatment.\nReductions in serum Tg are expected in responders, but clinical\ndecisions cannot be based on this parameter alone.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Lenvatinib and sorafenib should be\nconsidered the standard ﬁrst-line systemic therapy for RAI-\nrefractory DTC [I, A; ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 scores: 3 for lenvatinib, 2 for sorafenib].\nLenvatinib and sorafenib have been approved by the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) and the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration\n(FDA)\nfor\nprogressive,\nmetastatic,\nRAI-\nrefractory DTC. Both drugs have been investigated in two large,\nrandomised phase III trials (sorafenib in DECISION [96], lenva-\ntinib in SELECT [97]). Head-to-head comparisons of the two\nagents have not been undertaken. They cannot be compared\nbased on their performances in the RCTs cited above, which dif-\nfered substantially in terms of enrolment criteria. Unlike the\nDECISION population, participants in SELECT underwent man-\ndatory assessment of radiological disease progression at entry by\nan independent committee, and pre-treated patients were not\nexcluded. In addition, progression-free survival (PFS) in the pla-\ncebo arm of SELECT was shorter than that of DECISION, which\nalso suggests that the SELECT trial population may have had\nmore advanced or more active disease than that of the\nDECISION study.\nIn the DECISION trial, 417 patients were randomised (1 : 1)\nto treatment with sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) or placebo,\nwith crossover permitted at disease progression [96]. The study\ndemonstrated that sorafenib signiﬁcantly prolongs PFS [me-\ndian PFS (mPFS) 10.8 versus 5.8 months with placebo, hazard\nratio (HR) 0.59, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.45–0.76,\nP ¼ 0.001]. Objective responses (all partial) occurred in 12% of\nthe sorafenib group and 0.5% of placebo-treated patients\n(P < 0.0001). The median response duration was 10.2 months\n(95% CI 7.4–16.6). Stable disease lasting \u00036 months (post hoc\nanalysis) was observed more frequently with sorafenib (82/196\npatients, 41.8% versus 67/202 patients, 33.2% in the placebo\ngroup). Disease control (partial response or disease stability\nlasting \u00036 months; post hoc analysis) was achieved in 106/196\npatients (54.1%) treated with sorafenib and 33.8% (68/201\npatients) of those receiving placebo (P < 0.0001). Most patients\n(71.4%) receiving placebo crossed over to sorafenib, and 20.3%\nof patients in sorafenib arm and 8.6% of patients in placebo\narm received additional therapies. OS was similar in the two\narms (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.54–1.19, P ¼ 0.14), and the median\nOS (mOS) had not been reached at the data cut-off (31 August\n2012). The median durations of treatment were 10.6 months\n(interquartile range 5.3–15.7) with sorafenib and 6.5 months\n(3.3–12.9) with placebo.\nIn the SELECT trial, 392 patients were randomised 2 : 1 to re-\nceive lenvatinib or placebo [97]. The study met the primary aim,\ndemonstrating that lenvatinib signiﬁcantly prolonged PFS com-\npared with placebo, as ﬁrst-line therapy (mPFS 18.3 versus\n3.6 months in the placebo arm, HR 0.21, 99% CI 0.14–0.31,\nP < 0.001) and in pre-treated patients (mPFS 15.1 months). The\n6-month PFS rates were 77.5% (lenvatinib group) and 25.4%\n(placebo group). Responses to lenvatinib (complete in four cases)\nwere observed in 64.8% patients (compared with 1.5% in the pla-\ncebo group) (OR 28.87, 95% CI 12.46–66.86, P < 0.001).\nResponses occurred rapidly (median time to objective response:\n2 months, 95% CI 1.9–3.5).

In this trial, TC appeared to be\nmore aggressive in older people, as reﬂected by the mOS\nof 18.4 months (95% CI 13.3–20.3) reached in placebo-treated\npatients >65 years compared with that in younger subjects, which\nhad not been reached when the results were published [99].\nThe optimal sequence of MKIs in RAI-refractory DTC cannot\nbe determined based on currently available evidence. Previous\nMKI therapy is not a contraindication for subsequent use of\nthese drugs, but data on second-line efﬁcacy are scarce [II, C].\nMKIs should be continued until the disease progresses, un-\nacceptable toxicities occur or the patient asks to stop treatment.\nIn the presence of single-site progression, locoregional treatment\n(e.g. EBRT, embolisation, percutaneous treatment modalities)\ncan be done for local control, without discontinuing MKIs [V,\nC]. Data on real life experiences with lenvatinib in DTC patients\nare now available and as expected, the drug’s efﬁcacy was not as\ngood as that observed in highly selected RCT populations [100,\n101]. Other antiangiogenic agents have been tested as ﬁrst-line\ntherapy in phase II trials, with widely varying response rates\n(Table 6) [102–110]. None of these agents has been approved yet\nfor RAI-resistant DTC. MKIs with speciﬁc targets [e.g. BRAF,\ntropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK)] have also been used.\nVemurafenib has reportedly displayed activity against BRAF\nV600E TCs in both MKI-naive [overall response rate (ORR)\n38.5%, 95% CI 20.2–59.4] and pre-treated patients (ORR 27.3%,\n95% CI 10.7–50.2) [81, 111]. Larotrectinib has been recently\napproved by the FDA and the EMA for all paediatric and adult\ncancers expressing the TRK gene fusion protein. Partial\nresponses were observed in all ﬁve TC patients treated with this\ndrug in a recently reported phase I/II trial [112]. There is a bio-\nlogical rationale for treating advanced TCs with antiangiogenetic\nagents plus immune checkpoint inhibitors [113], and an RCT is\ncurrently underway to assess the activity of lenvatinib plus pem-\nbrolizumab in this setting (NCT02973997).\nAEs of MKIs: AEs occurred in 98.6% of patients receiving sora-\nfenib during the DECISION trial [96]: hand–foot syndrome,\ndiarrhoea, alopaecia, rash or desquamation, fatigue, weight loss\nand hypertension were the most common. Serum TSH levels\nexceeding 0.5 mIU/ml were observed in 33.3% patients (69/207)\nin the sorafenib arm. TSH increases are a recognised AE of sorafe-\nnib and other MKIs, and levels should be checked monthly to en-\nsure that suppression is maintained.\nSerious AEs were documented in 37.2% (77/207) of the\nsorafenib-treated participants. Nine developed a second malig-\nnancy: squamous-cell skin cancer in seven cases (one patient also\nhad melanoma), acute myeloid leukaemia and bladder cancer in\nthe remaining two cases. Skin cancer is a consequence of sorafe-\nnib’s paradoxical activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase\nsignalling in keratinocytes harbouring mutated or activated RAS.\nIn clinical practice, skin cancer can be resected surgically with\ncurative intent and sorafenib continued, but monitoring and\nearly intervention for skin lesions is essential. The high rate of\nAEs inevitably diminishes treatment compliance. In DECISION,\nwhere the mean daily dose was 651 mg, AEs frequently led to\ntreatment interruptions (137/207 patients, 66.2%), dose reduc-\ntions (133 patients, 64.3%) or drug withdrawals (39 patients,\n18.8%).\nIn SELECT, at least one side-effect also occurred in all\nlenvatinib-treated patients [114], the most common being hyper-\ntension, diarrhoea, fatigue, proteinuria, rash and hand–foot syn-\ndrome. Treatment interruptions (82.4% of patients) and dose\nreductions (67.8%) led to a mean daily lenvatinib dose of 17.2 mg\n[97]. AEs generally occurred during the ﬁrst few weeks of treat-\nment and decreased rapidly after treatment is interrupted. A trial\ncomparing lenvatinib starting doses of 24 versus 18 mg is current-\nly recruiting (NCT02657369). More selective agents such as laro-\ntrectinib for TRK fusion-positive cancers and highly selective\nRET inhibitors (e.g. LOXO 292, BLU 667) have better toxicity\nproﬁles. Off-target side-effects are uncommon with these drugs,\nand toxicities are mild and manageable, mostly of grades 1 and 2\n[112, 115].\nPhysicians, patients and caregivers should be aware of these\nAEs. Caught early, they can be effectively managed, but preven-\ntion, when feasible, is always advisable [116]. The aim should be\nto manage the side-effects successfully without resorting to dose\nor treatment schedule adjustments, which can have detrimental\neffects on treatment efﬁcacy. A post hoc analysis of the impact of\ndose interruption on lenvatinib efﬁcacy in SELECT trial partici-\npants revealed that longer interruptions and lower mean dose\nintensities may diminish the potential beneﬁt conferred by the\ndrug [117]. As MKIs may cause fatal harm when administered to\na pregnant woman and may result in reduced fertility in both\nsexes, fertility preservation approaches should be discussed be-\nfore treatment starts [118].\nConventional cytotoxic therapy: The results of chemotherapy\n(ChT) administration (e.g. doxorubicin) in RAI-refractory DTC\nare disappointing; therefore, it is not recommended unless MKI\ntherapy is contraindicated.\nATC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nATCs are very rare tumours that usually present at an advanced\nstage, display extremely aggressive behaviour, and are associated\nwith a very poor prognosis. They are morphologically heteroge-\nneous and must be distinguished from other neck tumours,\nincluding squamous carcinoma of the larynx, sarcomas and lym-\nphomas. Preoperative biopsy assessment includes diagnostic\nimmunomarkers that can differentiate ATC from large cell\nlymphoma or pleomorphic sarcoma. The molecular proﬁle of\nATC includes mutations of the TERT promoter (associated with\nBRAF or RAS mutations) and TP53 [21, 22], as well as targetable\nabnormalities (e.g. NTRK and ALK rearrangements).\nStaging and risk assessment\nIn the eighth edition of the UICC TNM staging system [23], diag-\nnosis of ATC is no longer associated with pT4 stage by default.\nCases treated with resection are staged like other TC histotypes,\nbased on tumour size and extension (Table 2).\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1869\n\n---\nATCs are considered one of the most aggressive solid tumours\nin humans. The median survival after the initial diagnosis is\n\u00054 months and only one out of ﬁve patients survives more than\n12 months (1-year survival rates: 10%–20%). Long-term survival\nhas been reported, but the estimated rate at 10 years is <5%. The\ndismal prognosis stems from the fact that over 40% of the\npatients present at diagnosis with large primary tumours (mean\nsize: 6 cm), gross extrathyroidal extension and locoregional and\ndistant metastases, which make complete resection unlikely\n[119]. A thorough imaging work-up should be carried out soon\nafter the diagnosis. The FDG–PET-CT scan is the most sensitive\ntool for documenting the extent of disease. Scans should be\nrepeated at all stages of treatment [120].\nATC\nConﬁ rm diagnosis with histopathologya [V, A]\nResectable (R0/R1) with minimal morbidityc\nUnresectable/M1 disease\nMutated\nWild-type\nBest supportive \ncare [V, B]\nFully stage urgentlyb with cross-sectional imaging\nFDG–PET-CT useful for M1 disease [IV, A]\nFibreoptic analysis of airway and vocal cord function \n± endoscopic review of oesophageal invasion [IV, A]\nDiscussion in a multidisciplinary tumour board including palliative care [V, A]\nTT ± neck dissection [IV, A] \nIf R0/R1 and M0, \nconsider postoperative EBRT ± ChTd  \nas soon as possible post-surgerye [IV, A] \nDabrafenib + trametinib \n[V, B]\nClinical trials or palliative \nChTg [V, B]\nPalliative EBRT \n[V, B]\nFigure 5.

ATC is rarely amenable to complete resection (Figure 5).\nTotal thyroidectomy with bilateral central neck dissection may be\ncarried out in those very rare cases of localised ATC in M0\npatients. Extensive resection with total laryngectomy, oesopha-\ngectomy and/or resection of the great vessels has been reported in\nhighly selected cases in specialised centres, but postoperative\nmortality and morbidity are high and there is no high-level evi-\ndence to indicate that this approach improves survival. The prog-\nnosis is also unaffected by incomplete palliative resection (R2) or\n‘debulking’, which is not generally recommended [IV, E] [121].\nTracheostomy may be needed to alleviate symptoms in patients\nwith moderately progressive disease, but the impact of tracheos-\ntomy on QoL must be considered. Given the technical complex-\nity, the procedure is generally done under general anaesthesia. An\nexperienced team of surgeons and anaesthesiologists is essential,\nas is a complete preoperative cross-sectional imaging assessment\nof the trachea and tumour.\nRadiotherapy. Optimal outcomes in terms of survival and local\ndisease control in ATC require complete or near-complete [no\nresidual tumour (R0) or microscopic residual tumour (R1)] re-\nsection followed by high-dose EBRT, with or without concomi-\ntant ChT [V, A] [122, 123]. However, this multimodal approach\ncan strongly impact QoL and should be reserved for carefully\nselected patients to ensure clinical beneﬁt. Timely discussion\nwithin a multidisciplinary team setting is strongly recommended\n[V, A] (Figure 5).\nAnalysis of 1200 ATC cases in a large national database [121]\nrevealed signiﬁcantly better outcomes when multimodality\ntherapy included radical surgery (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.28–0.43,\nP < 0.0001 versus no surgery or palliative surgery), 40 Gy of\nEBRT (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38–0.56, P < 0.0001 versus no ERBT\nor <40 Gy EBRT) and ChT of any type (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52–\n0.76, P < 0.0001 versus no ChT). Outcomes also varied with\nUICC stage. For stage IVA disease, the beneﬁt from additional\ntherapies was nonsigniﬁcant. For stage IVB disease, however,\nradical surgery followed by both EBRT and ChT signiﬁcantly\nimproved cause-speciﬁc survival compared with radical sur-\ngery alone or with EBRT (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25–0.81,\nP ¼ 0.0083).\nA meta-analysis of 17 retrospective studies including 1147\npatients looked at the impact of postoperative radiotherapy\n(PORT) after radical ATC resection and found that it signiﬁcant-\nly reduced the risk of death as compared with radical resection\nalone (HR 0.556, 95% CI 0.419–0.737, P < 0.001) [124].\nExploratory analyses demonstrated that PORT might also confer\na survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IVA (HR 0.364,\nP ¼ 0.012) or IVB (HR 0.460, P ¼ 0.059) disease but not for stage\nIVC. For best outcomes, PORT must be delivered as soon as pos-\nsible after surgery [IV, A], but the patient must have recovered\nfrom surgery sufﬁciently to be able to lie ﬂat and tolerate\nimmobilisation.\nBecause of the improved dose distribution and the ability to re-\nduce toxicity, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (RT) is the rec-\nommended approach [IV, C] [125]. There is some evidence of a\ndose–response relation. Outcomes in ATC are improved with\ndoses exceeding 45–50 Gy [126, 127]. An analysis of the United\nStates National Cancer Database showed maximal beneﬁts with\ndoses >60 Gy [128]. Evidence that hyperfractionated accelerated\nRT (i.e. delivery of two or more fractions per day over a shorter\ntreatment time) improved survival over that obtained with con-\nventional fractionation is insufﬁcient, whereas it was clearly asso-\nciated with increased toxicity [129–131].\nFor stage IVA or IVB disease, concomitant ChT (usually with\ndoxorubicin or a platinum agent) has been used. Most of the data\nreported on this approach came from single-institution series\nand the clinical beneﬁts reported have been variable. It has been\nshown that concomitant taxane therapy has radio-sensitising\neffects [132].\nPalliative EBRT: In patients with unresectable disease, EBRT\nhas a role in symptom control [V, C] [133]. The aim is usually to re-\nduce the rate of growth of the neck mass and thereby the pressure\nsymptoms. Fractionation schedules vary according to the individual\npatient (most commonly from 20Gy in ﬁve fractions to 30 Gy in 10\nfractions). These fractionation regimens allow simple beam\narrangements such as parallel opposed or simple three-dimensional\nconformal techniques, so that RT can be started as soon as possible.\nManagement of advanced/metastatic disease\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine. Novel systemic\ntherapies are urgently needed to improve the generally poor out-\ncomes associated with ATC. Clinical trial enrolment should\ntherefore be encouraged for patients with good clinical PS [V, B].\nFor patients ineligible for systemic treatments or clinical trials,\nbest supportive care should be discussed (Figure 5) [133].\nTo date, cytotoxic ChT has been the primary treatment for\nmetastatic disease, but it is associated with very low response rates\nand signiﬁcant toxicities [133]. Recommended regimens consist\nof single-agent therapy with paclitaxel or doxorubicin or com-\nbined treatments (e.g. carboplatin/paclitaxel, docetaxel/doxo-\nrubicin) administered weekly or every 3–4 weeks [134–136]. No\ndata are available to guide decisions on second-line therapy\n[133]. Chemoradiotherapy can be considered for local control of\nunresectable stage IVB disease, ideally with weekly administra-\ntion of radio-sensitising ChT (see above).\nSeveral novel approaches (targeted therapy, immunother-\napy) are being studied, alone or in combination, to improve\nthe poor response rates achieved with current strategies. The ef-\nﬁcacy of lenvatinib in ATC is controversial. In 2015, the\ndrug was approved by the Japanese regulatory agency for treat-\nment of TCs, including ATC, based on data from a single-arm,\nopen-label, phase II study conducted on a population of 51\npatients [137], 17 of whom had ATC. The primary aim was to\nestablish the drug’s safety in this setting. The ATC patients had\nan mPFS of 7.4 months (95% CI 1.7–12.9), an mOS of\n10.6 months (95% CI 3.8–19.8) and an objective response rate\nof 24%. These ﬁndings prompted an international, multi-\ncentre, phase II trial, but the trial was stopped early due to futil-\nity (NCT02657369).\nMolecular proﬁling studies have begun to elucidate the mo-\nlecular drivers and the multistep dedifferentiation associated\nwith ATC tumourigenesis [21, 22]. Early mutation of BRAF and\nRAS has been reported in 25% and 28% of the cases, respectively\n[138]. In a phase II, open-label basket trial, patients with BRAF\nAnnals of Oncology\nSpecial article\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\ndoi:10.1093/annonc/mdz400 | 1871\n\n---\nV600E-positive malignancies (including 16 with ATC) were\ntreated with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily)\nplus the MEK inhibitor trametinib (2 mg once daily). The ORR\nwas 69% (11/16; 95% CI 41%–89%), and the treatment was well\ntolerated [139]. In May 2018, this combination received FDA\napproval for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic\nATC with the BRAF V600E mutation. If available, this should be\nthe ﬁrst-line therapy for advanced BRAF V600E ATC patients\n[V, B]. Other rare mutations and genetic aberrations may also\nprove to be druggable, such as ALK translocations [21, 22].\nExtended molecular proﬁling of ATCs should be strongly\nencouraged as it may reveal promising possibilities for targeted\ntherapies.\nIn the presence of non-druggable mutations, targeting the tu-\nmour microenvironment or common cancer signalling pathways\nis an alternative approach. ATC immunoproﬁling has revealed\nhigh numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating lymphocytes in the tumour\nand tumour cell expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-\nL1) [138]. Immunotherapy with antibodies targeting pro-\ngrammed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor or PD-L1 has produced\nimpressive results in many malignancies, but few data are avail-\nable on their use in ATC. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody\nspartalizumab was tested in 41 heavily pre-treated patients with\nadvanced ATC, and responses were observed in 19.5%, opening\nthe road to the use of immunotherapy in ATC [140].\nInclusion of targeted therapy, immunotherapy, ChT and/or\nRT,\nadministered\nin\ncombination\nor\nsequentially,\nin\nmultidisciplinary ATC management regimens may improve pa-\ntient outcomes (NCT03181100).\nMTC\nDiagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\nMTC is morphologically heterogeneous and can mimic virtually\nall other primary thyroid tumours. Demonstration of calcitonin\n(Ctn) expression is mandatory for the diagnosis. Rare primary\nCtn-negative neuroendocrine carcinomas of the thyroid exist\nand must be distinguished from metastases from neuroendo-\ncrine neoplasms of the lung. In these cases, carcinoembryonic\nantigen (CEA) determination can be useful, being the only neck\ntumour expressing this marker. The preoperative diagnosis\ncan also be challenging in the absence of a consistent\nimmunophenotype.\nRET and RAS proto-oncogene mutations are detected in\n\u000590% of MTCs and are considered the predominant drivers of\nthese tumours [141]. RET mutations occur sporadically, as som-\natic events, or can be inherited as germline events associated with\nfamilial MTC or the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes\ntype 2A and 2B (MEN2A and MEN2B). A quarter of MTCs occur\nas part of an inherited syndrome, and germline RET mutations\nare present in up to 10% of the patients presenting with apparent-\nly sporadic MTCs.

Strong genotype–phenotype associations\naffecting age at onset (most MTCs occur either in childhood or\nearly adulthood) and tumour aggressiveness have been reported\nfor speciﬁc germline RET mutations. MTCs harbouring somatic\nRET mutations are also commonly associated with more aggres-\nsive behaviour than that of their wild-type RET counterparts. The\nvast majority (91.4%) of sporadic MTCs with distant metastases\nharbour such mutations, in most cases RET M918T (93.8%)\n[144]. There is currently no evidence supporting the value of rou-\ntine screening of MTC patients for somatic RET mutations.\nHowever, if treatment of advanced MTCs with selective RET\ninhibitors is planned, RET testing for somatic mutations is\nneeded to individualise therapy [III, C].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe UICC system is recommended for staging all MTC patients,\nbased on its utility in predicting disease-speciﬁc mortality [IV, A]\n[23]. The eighth edition of this system has introduced some im-\nportant changes in the criteria used for staging thyroid tumours,\nincluding MTCs. Extrathyroidal extension, for example, is now\nimportant only when it is macroscopically evident (pT3b) [23].\nIn the absence of gross extracapsular extension, the primary will\nbe staged solely on the basis of its size (pT1, pT2 or pT3a)\n(Table 2).\nCtn and CEA are valuable diagnostic, prognostic and predict-\nive markers for use with MTC. Their serum concentrations are\ndirectly related to the C-cell mass [145, 146]. Preoperative Ctn\nlevels correlate strongly with tumour diameter and postoperative\nCtn levels.

Serum Ctn levels exceeding\n500 pg/ml suggest distant metastatic disease and should be\nexplored with additional whole-body imaging procedures.\nSerum Ctn should be measured 60–90 days after thyroidectomy.\nPatients whose postoperative basal serum Ctn level is normal\n(<10 pg/ml) are considered ‘biochemically cured’ and have a 10-\nyear survival rate of 97.7%. However, 3% of patients with normal\nbasal serum Ctn levels following thyroidectomy experience bio-\nchemical recurrence within 7.5 years [143]. CEA is not a speciﬁc\nbiomarker for MTC, and serum assays are not informative for the\nearly diagnosis of MTC. However, they are useful for monitoring\nthe progression of clinically evident MTCs [IV, B] [148–150].\nDoubling times for postoperative serum Ctn and CEA levels\n(deﬁned as the interval of time in which the tumour markers lev-\nels have doubled) are established prognostic markers in MTC\n[IV, B] [148–150]. They are currently considered the best avail-\nable predictors of tumour behaviour, recurrence and cancer-\nrelated death. A Ctn doubling time exceeding 6 months is associ-\nated with 5- and 10-year survival rates of 92% and 37%, respect-\nively; shorter doubling times predict markedly worse survival\n(25% and 8% at 5 and 10 years, respectively) [148]. In patients\nwith poorly differentiated and aggressive MTCs, Ctn values may\nactually decrease over time, whereas CEA levels increase [151].\nDetails on the use of Ctn and CEA doubling times are available\nbelow in the ‘Follow-up, long-term implications and survivor-\nship’ section.\nManagement of local/locoregional disease\nSurgery. Preoperative screening for pheochromocytoma and\nhyperparathyroidism is highly recommended for all patients with\nMTC (except in those already known to have MEN2B) [IV, A]\n[142, 143]. Neck US should be carried out to identify regional\nmetastases; if sonographic (or clinical) ﬁndings are suspicious,\ncontrast-enhanced CT of the neck and chest is indicated. Work-\nup for distant metastases, including chest CT, liver and axial bone\nMRI and 6-ﬂuoro-(18F)-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (FDOPA)-\nPET scan (if available), should be done if serum Ctn levels exceed\n500 pg/ml or clinical ﬁndings are suspicious. Neck dissection,\nwhen needed, should be done by surgeons with substantial ex-\nperience in TC surgery. The initial approach will depend on pre-\noperative serum Ctn levels and neck imaging ﬁndings (Figure 6)\n[IV, B]. The guidelines in the algorithm are based on retrospect-\nive cohort studies [147, 152]. The grade B recommendation is\nbased on the clinical beneﬁts of elective neck dissection in\npatients with serum Ctn levels <500 pg/ml, for whom surgery\nmay be curative.\nFor carriers of germline mutations, the recommended age for\nprophylactic total thyroidectomy depends on the type of muta-\ntion. Individuals with germline M918T mutations should under-\ngo total thyroidectomy within the ﬁrst year of life. For those with\na C634F or A883F mutation (also considered high risk), surgery\ncan be postponed until age 5 unless Ctn levels increase. Those\nwith other mutations should be monitored from age 5 on with\nCtn assays and neck US, and surgery should be done if Ctn levels\nincrease or if the parents request it [143].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nCtn and CEA monitoring should both be included in the early\nand long-term postoperative staging work-ups [IV, B] [150].\nSerial measurements allow the calculation of doubling times,\nwhich provide useful information as described above. Currently\navailable data indicate that Ctn doubling times should be based\non at least four consecutive measurements, preferably obtained\nover a 2-year period [IV, C] [142, 143]. All measurements must\nbe made by the same laboratory using the same assay. The ATA\nprovides an online calculator for rapid determination of doubling\ntimes from user-supplied series of serum Ctn or serum CEA levels\n[153]. Figure 7 summarises MTC management strategies guided\nby Ctn and CEA levels and doubling times. Clinically relevant dis-\nease sites are rarely detected in patients with Ctn levels <150 pg/\nml, but the likelihood of structural disease increases as Ctn and\nCEA levels rise.\nMultiple imaging modalities should be used to identify locore-\ngional and/or distant metastases [IV, B] [142, 143]. Contrast-\nenhanced whole-body (brain, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis)\nCT with ultra-thin reconstructions is sensitive and speciﬁc\nenough to allow one to estimate the burden of systemic disease\nand to assess and identify target lesions. Target and non-target\nlesions to assess are measured using RECIST v1.1 [94]. Contrast-\nenhanced MRI is more sensitive in identifying liver lesions, which\ncan be misdiagnosed on CT or US as benign cystic lesions. US is\nuseful for assessing neck lymph node involvement, although, as\nmentioned before, it sometimes provides inadequate visualisa-\ntion of deep structures and those acoustically shadowed by bone\nor air. For these structures, CT and MRI are more sensitive, pro-\nvide greater morphological detail, and are recommended when\nsurgical interventions, EBRT or other locoregional ablative\napproaches are being planned. MRI is recommended for identify-\ning or excluding brain metastases. Bone scans in MTC patients\nare high in sensitivity but low in speciﬁcity. Whole-body\nbone MRI without contrast medium offers higher speciﬁcity,\nparticularly for osteoblastic lesions. Contrast enhancement is\nrecommended when extraosseous extension or compression\nof the spinal cord or other neurological structures is suspected.\nEndoscopic exploration of the upper digestive tract and\nairways is mandatory whenever there is a high suspicion of\ninﬁltration.\nAs indolent tumours, MTCs generally display low avidity for\nFDG, so FDG–PET–CT is not recommended for their staging,\nbut it can be useful for assessing advanced disease characterised\nby dedifferentiation and rapid progression [151]. FDOPA–PET\nhas high sensitivity and speciﬁcity in MTC [154, 155] and it can\nreveal unidentiﬁed metastases or small lesions, but cost and avail-\nability issues make it unsuitable. Gallium-68 (68Ga) somatostatin\nanalogue PET–CT is relatively insensitive and is not useful for\nstaging, but it does reﬂect expression of somatostatin receptors,\nwhich is useful information when the feasibility of radionuclide\ntherapy is being explored [156].\nSpecial article\nAnnals of Oncology\n1874 | Filetti et al.\nVolume 30 | Issue 12 | 2019\n\n---\nTable 7.

Disease behaviour varies widely—indolent\nin some cases, rapidly progressive in others—and can be reliably\npredicted by Ctn and CEA doubling times. Advanced MTCs are\ninvariably associated with the secretion of a variety of peptides\n(e.g. prostaglandins, kinins, vasoactive intestinal peptide, sero-\ntonin, histaminase), which can cause unpleasant symptoms such\nas ﬂushing and diarrhoea. Management of these symptoms\nshould be the ﬁrst goal of treatment.\nThe systemic therapies currently approved for MTC have not\nbeen shown to improve OS, so evidence-based guidance is lacking\non when to start these drugs and how patients with indolent\ndisease should be followed. Decisions are based mainly on clini-\ncians’ experience. Multidisciplinary input (e.g. from surgeons,\nendocrinologists, nuclear medicine physicians, medical and radi-\nation oncologists, pain therapists and palliative care specialists) is\nstrongly recommended to ensure optimal care for these patients.\nActive treatment (e.g. locoregional or systemic MKI administra-\ntion) should be considered in the presence of symptoms, lesions\nclose to vital structures, high-tumour burdens or disease progres-\nsion (as deﬁned by RECIST v1.1) [94].\nSystemic therapy and personalised medicine.\nFirst-line systemic therapy: Cabozantinib [I, A] and vandetanib\n[I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] are the ﬁrst-line systemic treat-\nments for progressive metastatic MTC.

Both drugs inhibit RET kinase activity\nto some extent, and this was the major reason they were originally\nproposed for treating MTC patients. However, their antitumour\neffect is mainly due to their strong inhibition of key angiogenic\npathway components, including vascular endothelial growth fac-\ntor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2).\nThe ZETA trial compared vandetanib (300 mg daily) with pla-\ncebo (2 : 1) in 331 patients with symptomatic and/or metastatic\nMTC [158]. Radiological evidence of disease progression was not\nan enrolment requirement, and placebo-to-vandetanib crossover\nwas allowed if disease progression occurred. The predicted mPFS\nin the vandetanib arm was signiﬁcantly longer than that observed\nin the placebo group (30.5 versus 19.3 months; HR 0.46, 95% CI\n0.31–0.69, P < 0.001). The ORR was also higher in the vandetanib\narm (45% versus 13% for placebo, OR 5.48, 95% CI 2.99–10.79,\nP < 0.001), and all but one of the responses in the placebo arm\nwere recorded after crossover to vandetanib. Radiological\nresponses\nwere\naccompanied\nby\nsigniﬁcant\nbiochemical\nresponses (reductions in Ctn and CEA levels in 69% and 52% of\ncases, respectively). Vandetanib exhibited activity independently\nof the tumour’s RET status, previous treatment, metastasis\nsite(s), disease progression status and tumour burden. When the\nZETA data were ﬁrst published, no survival advantage was\nreported for patients managed with vandetanib and no updates\nhave been published since then. In a phase I/II trial of vandetanib\nin children with MTC (two courses at 100 mg/day, then 150 mg/\nday), partial responses were seen in 47% patients, and the AE pro-\nﬁle resembled that observed in adults [160].\nIn the EXAM trial, cabozantinib (140 mg daily) was tested\nagainst placebo (2 : 1) in 330 patients with metastatic MTC [159].\nThe main inclusion criterion was disease progression within the\n14 months preceding study entry. Prior therapy, including MKIs,\nwas allowed, and crossover was not permitted. Compared with\nplacebo, cabozantinib was associated with a signiﬁcantly longer\nmPFS (11.2 versus 4.0 months, HR 0.28, 95% CI, 0.19–0.40,\nP < 0.001) and a higher rate of responses (all partial) (28% versus\n0%, median duration 14.7 months). Efﬁcacy was observed across\nall subgroups, regardless of age, tumour location, tumour bur-\nden, progression rate, prior kinase inhibitor treatment (in 20% of\npatients) or RET/RAS mutation status. mOS rates were similar in\nthe two arms (26.6 versus 21.1 months, HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.64–\n1.12, P ¼ 0.024), but in the subgroup with RETM918T-positive\nMTCs, cabozantinib was associated with signiﬁcantly longer sur-\nvival (44.3 versus 18.9 months with placebo, HR 0.60, 95% CI\n0.38–0.94, P ¼ 0.03). PFS was consistent with OS in the\nRETM918T-positive\ncases\n(HR\n0.15,\n95%\nCI\n0.08–0.28,\nP < 0.0001) [161].\nAlthough the ZETA and EXAM trials both focused on patients\nwith advanced and/or metastatic disease, their designs and inclu-\nsion criteria were different. The markedly longer mPFS in the pla-\ncebo arm of the ZETA trial—19.3 months [158] versus 4 months\nin EXAM [159]—suggests population differences. Indeed, unlike\nZETA participants, those enrolled in EXAM had to meet RECIST\ncriteria for disease progression and were thus likely to have more\nadvanced disease. The results of the two trials are therefore not\ncomparable, and there is no clear evidence supporting vandetanib\nover cabozantinib as ﬁrst-line treatment. Both are active in ﬁrst-\nand second-line regimens, both prolonged PFS compared with\nplacebo and both displayed RET/RAS status-independent efﬁ-\ncacy. The choice of which drug to use as ﬁrst-line treatment may\nbe based on potential toxicity in each patient (see below).\nHowever, cabozantinib, in a subgroup analysis, demonstrated a\nsigniﬁcant advantage in PFS and OS in patients with RETM918T\nor RAS-mutant MTCs [II, C] [161]. As noted for lenvatinib, re-\ncently released real world data on the efﬁcacy of vandetanib in\nMTC patients are somewhat less encouraging than those gener-\nated in the highly selected population of RCTs [162].\nOther anti-angiogenic MKIs (e.g. sorafenib, motesanib, pazo-\npanib, sunitinib, lenvatinib) have already undergone phase II\ntesting in advanced MTC patients. The most interesting results\nregarded sunitinib and lenvatinib, which were associated with\nresponse rates of 50% and 36%, respectively [157]. Thus far,\nhowever, no MKIs have been approved for second-line use. A\nrandomised trial assessing the efﬁcacy of nintedanib as second-\nline MKI therapy was prematurely closed due to ﬂat enrolment\n(NCT01788982). The more selective RET inhibitors (e.g.\nLOXO-292-NCT03157128,\nBLU-667-NCT03037385)\nappear\npromising and are now under investigation. The RET-\nsuppressing activity of these drugs is essential to their antitu-\nmour effects in MTC, whereas their anti-angiogenic activity is\nnegligible.\nManagement of side-effects: AEs are very common during MKI\ntherapy, and their management is critical for optimising these\ncompounds’ therapeutic ratios. In the ZETA trial, 35% of the\npatients in the vandetanib arm required dose reductions and 12%\ndiscontinued treatment due to toxicity [158]. The most common\nTable 9.

Attempts to reduce the rate of grade 2 or higher AEs with\nan active support programme (including patient contact/visit\nevery 2 weeks and supportive agents such as sunscreen and lo-\nperamide) have been unsuccessful [163]. AEs were also common\nin the EXAM trial, with grade 3 or 4 AEs in 69% of patients\nreceiving cabozantinib. The most common were diarrhoea\n(15.9%), hand–foot syndrome (12.6%) and fatigue (9.3%). Pre-\nexisting disease-related diarrhoea can be worsened by MKI ther-\napy (as a drug-related AE) or improved as a direct effect of the\ndrug’s activity. Increased TSH levels were reported in 57% of the\ncabozantinib-treated patients. TSH levels should be monitored\ncontinuously during treatment, as these patients are generally on\nhormone-replacement therapy if they have undergone total thy-\nroidectomy. Levels should be kept within the normal range: TSH\nsuppression produces no beneﬁts in patients with MTC (unlike\nthose with DTC). AEs associated with VEGF-pathway inhibition\n(e.g. hypertension, haemorrhage, ﬁstula formation, gastrointes-\ntinal\nperforation)\noccurred\nmore\nfrequently\namong\ncabozantinib-treated patients than in those treated with placebo.\nIn the EXAM trial, 79% of patients in the cabozantinib arm\nhad dose reductions, 65% interrupted treatment due to AEs, and\n16% stopped treatment because of toxicities. Randomised trials\nare underway to assess the activities of lower, potentially less\ntoxic doses of vandetanib (150 versus 300 mg, NCT01496313)\nand\ncabozantinib\n(140 mg\ncapsules\nversus\n60 mg\npills,\nNCT01896479).\nThe preliminary results comparing the effects of the two doses\nof vandetanib in patients with advanced MTC have been posted\non ClinicalTrials.gov and showed that the starting dose of 150 mg\nis equally effective as the high 300 mg dose in term of ORR.\nInterruption of treatment and dose reductions are the most\ncommon means for managing AEs. Most decrease in intensity\nafter a few days of withdrawal, but vandetanib AEs may be more\npersistent, given the drug’s 19-day half-life. However, frequent\ninterruptions might reduce the efﬁcacy of MKIs and/or trigger\ncertain escape mechanisms. Most AEs (e.g. hypertension, diar-\nrhoea) are well known and preventable. Useful guidelines for pre-\nventing and managing treatment-related AEs in these complex\ncases have been published by several societies. As for fertility pres-\nervation, the same measures taken for DTC patients are valid for\nthose with MTC.\nConventional\nsystemic\nChT\nand\nradionuclide\ntherapy:\nSystemically administered ChT has historically yielded poor\nresults in MTC. The available data have been generated by retro-\nspective analyses of small, single-institution cases series. The\nmost active drugs have been doxorubicin alone or combined with\ncisplatin, which achieved a response in around 20% at best, or as\na combination with 5-ﬂuorouracil and dacarbazine which did\nnot result in much greater responses [157].\nRadionuclide therapy is an option in selected cases [III, C]. The\nactivity of yttrium-90–DOTA-[D-Phe1-Tyr3]-octreotide (90Y-\nDOTATOC) was tested in a phase II trial including 31 patients\nwith metastatic MTC and increasing Ctn levels. Post-treatment\ndecreases in Ctn levels (the primary endpoint) occurred in 29%\nof the patients treated, and survival beneﬁts were also observed in\nthe responders [164]. RCTs have not been carried out to compare\nthe efﬁcacies of radionuclide and MKI therapies. Ideally, this\ncomparison should be done within a clinical trial setting. In short,\nthere is little evidence to support the use of either ChT or radio-\nnuclide therapy in patients with MTC, although either might be\nconsidered when MKIs are contraindicated.\nMethodology\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in accordance\nwith the ESMO standard operating procedures for Clinical\nPractice\nGuidelines\ndevelopment,\nhttp://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-Methodology.

Most frequently, these neoplasms\noccur in the digestive system, followed by the lung. The\nterm NEN encompasses well-differentiated neuroendocrine\ntumours (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine\ncarcinomas (NECs). NECs represent only 10%e20% of all\nNENs. The main focus of these guidelines is on sporadic\nsmall intestinal (SI)-NENs and pancreatic NENs (Pan-NENs)\nsince these are the most prevalent NENs at advanced\ndisease stages. In general, the management of other\ngastrointestinal NENs follows the same principles as in SI- or\nPan-NENs taking into consideration key features of NENs\nsuch as proliferative activity, somatostatin receptor (SSTR)\nexpression, tumour growth rate and extent of the disease.\nRecommendation\n\u0002 Diagnostic and therapeutic decision making should be\nbased on key features of NENs such as proliferative activ-\nity, SSTR expression, tumour growth rate and extent of\nthe disease [IV, A].\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nGastroenteropancreatic\nNENs\n(GEP-NENs)\nconstitute\na\nheterogeneous group of malignancies with a neuronal\nphenotype and the capacity to secrete amines\nand\nhormones. They share similarities with neuroendocrine cells\nof the embryological gut. The incidence of GEP-NENs has\nincreased more than six-fold between 1997 and 2012.1 The\nincidence of localised and regional NENs has increased\nmore than that of NENs with distant metastasis.1 The\nincidence of gastroenteropancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs) in the\nUSA based on an update of the Surveillance, Epidemiology\nand End Results (SEER) database is estimated to be 3.56/\n100 000/year. The 20-year limited-duration prevalence has\nrecently been calculated to 48/100 000.1 For incidences of\nindividual organs, see supplementary Table S1, available at\nAnnals of Oncology online. In Europe, the incidence of\nGEP-NETs has also increased, and ranges between 1.33e\n2.33/100 000 population; however, data arise from the\nnational and regional registries and are heterogeneous and\nmostly retrospective.2e4\nMen are affected slightly more frequently than women\nand show an adverse outcome. Most NENs are well-\ndifferentiated NETs and occur sporadically. GEP-NETs of\nthe pancreas, duodenum, stomach and, more rarely, NETs of\nthe thymus and lung may also arise in the setting of the\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome.\nPancreatic NETs (Pan-NETs) are also associated with von\nHippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, tuberous sclerosis (TSC) and\nneuroﬁbromatosis. In these hereditary settings, NETs are\nmultifocal, and the onset of disease is one to two decades\nearlier than in sporadic tumours. Furthermore, they are\noften early stage at the time of diagnosis. The frequency of\na hereditary background (MEN1, VHL syndromes) was\nreported as 5%.5 Recently, whole genomic sequencing\nrevealed 17% of apparently sporadic Pan-NETs carried\ngermline mutations also including DNA repair genes (e.g.\nMUTYH, CHEK2, BRCA2).6\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland.\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\ny Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last update\nMarch 2020.

The diagnosis of a NEN is suspected on\nhematoxylin eosin (HE)-stained tissue by histomorpho-\nlogical growth pattern and cytology. The neuroendocrine\nphenotype is proven by the immunohistochemical detec-\ntion of the neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and/or\nchromogranin A (CgA) [III, A]. Absence of both markers is\nvery exceptional in a subset of poorly differentiated NECs,\nbut in this case, other tumour entities must be carefully\nexcluded. Neuron-speciﬁc enolase (NSE) and CD56 markers\nare often positive in GEP-NENs, but are not recommended\ndue to their lack of speciﬁcity.7 GEP-NENs should be\nclassiﬁed based on morphology and proliferation (and,\nrarely, mutation spectrum) into well-differentiated NETs (G1\nto G3) and poorly-differentiated NECs (always G3) (Table 1).\nThese two classes of NENs reﬂect biologically and geneti-\ncally two different diseases. When showing a high prolifer-\nation rate (>20%), there are clear prognostic differences\nbetween the two classes. Therefore, the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations split the\nheterogeneous G3 GEP-NENs into well-differentiated NET\nG3 and poorly-differentiated NEC G3.8,9 Clinical history,\nhistomorphology and genetics (DAXX/ATRX/MEN1 mutation\nin Pan-NET G3, p53 mutation or RB loss in NEC G3) help in\nseparating the groups (Table 2).8 The separation of\nwell-differentiated NET G3 from NEC, which had been valid\nexclusively for Pan-NENs, has now been adopted for\ngastrointestinal (GI) NENs in an update of the WHO classi-\nﬁcation for GI NENs.9 Speciﬁc staining for peptide hormones\nsuch as gastrin, insulin, glucagon and amines (serotonin)\ncan be applied to conﬁrm the source of a clinical symp-\ntomatology, but there is no complete agreement between\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) and symptomatology, as there\ncan be synthesis of bioactive compounds without secretion\n[non-functioning (NF)-NENs].\nIHC for Ki-67 (MIB1) is mandatory to grade the NENs\naccording to the WHO 2017 and 2019 classiﬁcations. Both\nthe number of mitotic ﬁgures per 2 mm2 as well as the Ki-67\nindex based on assessment of 2000 cells should be reported\n(Table 1). In the case of a discordant grade between these\ntwo methods, the higher grade must be attributed.8 Other\nbiomarkers are optional, such as SSTR-2 staining, in\ncase functional imaging is not available, or DAXX/ATRX and\np53/RB mutations for discrimination of NET G3 and NEC G3\n(Table\n2).8\nFor\nappropriate\npathological\ndiagnosis,\nmorphology, grading and immunohistochemical staining for\nCgA and synaptophysin should be reported [III, A].\nNETs arising at different anatomical sites of the digestive\nsystem represent tumour entities that differ in their biology\nand clinical presentation (Table 3). Rarely, Pan-NETs may\nsecrete multiple hormones or NETs may transition from NF\nto functional status.10\nRecommendation\n\u0002 For appropriate pathological diagnosis, morphology,\ngrading and immunohistochemical staining for CgA and\nsynaptophysin should be reported. SSTR staining or spe-\nciﬁc staining for peptide hormones and amines as well as\nuse of molecular markers is optional and dependent on\nclinical requirements [III, A].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nDisease stage and tumour grade are the two major indepen-\ndent prognostic parameters and should always be assessed\n[III, A].

For\nstaging, the tumour, node and metastasis (TNM) staging sys-\ntem proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumour So-\nciety (ENETS) was recently widely adopted by the eighth\nedition of the Union for International Cancer Control/Amer-\nican Joint Committee on Cancer (UICC/AJCC) staging system11\nfor various types of GEP-NETs. For all NECs, the staging system\nof adenocarcinomas must be applied.11 Furthermore, the\nprimary tumour site has an impact on the prognosis in\nadvanced disease. Patients with Pan-NETs or colorectal NETs\nhave a less favourable prognosis than patients with small in-\ntestinal NETs (SI-NETs) (see supplementary Tables S1eS3,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online).\nComputed\ntomography\n(CT)\nconstitutes\nthe\nbasic\nradiological method for NET imaging because of its wide\navailability, standardised reproducible technique and generally\nhigh diagnostic yield.12 Small metastatic lymph nodes (<1 cm)\nmayescape detection by CT. For bone metastases, CTsensitivity\nis poor at 61% (range 46%e80%). Small peritoneal metastases\nmay be difﬁcult to visualise.13 The sensitivity of CT to detect\nNETs is 61%e93% and the speciﬁcity is 71%e100%.12,14,15 The\ndetection rate for liver metastases (LMs) is 79% (73%e\n94%),16,17 and for extra-abdominal soft tissue metastases, the\nsensitivity is 70% (60%e100%) and speciﬁcity 96% (range\n87%e100%).18 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is advan-\ntageous for examination of the liver and the pancreas and is\nusually preferred in the initial staging and for the preoperative\nimaging work-up [III, A]. Currently,\ndiffusion-weighted\nimaging (DWI) with MRI (DW-MRI), which is based on the\nrestricted movement of water in highly cellular tissues such as\nin tumours, is routinely applied and facilitates lesion detec-\ntion. The MRI sensitivity to detect Pan NETs is 79% (54%e\n100%), with fairly similar detection rates of 76% (61%e\n95%),19e21 and for LMs, the sensitivity is 75% (range 70%e\n80%) with near maximum speciﬁcity of 98%. The mean\nsensitivity of MRI for detection of LMs is 91% (range 82%e\n98%) as compared with CT with a mean sensitivity of 83%\n(range 75%e98%).22e26 MRI is also superior to CT for imaging\nof the bones and the brain. MRI may, however, miss small lung\nmetastases, and CT is preferred for imaging of the lungs as it\noffers a better spatial resolution.12 Contrast-enhanced ultra-\nsound (CEUS) is an excellent method to characterise liver le-\nsions that remain equivocal on CT/MRI. When therapy\nmonitoring is mainly conducted by CT, a three-phase CT\nshould be carried out. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the\ncurrent optimal imaging method to diagnose small Pan-NETs\nwith 86% (range 82%e93%) sensitivity and 92% (range\n86%e95%) speciﬁcity27 and allows also for biopsy, using ﬁne\nneedle aspiration for cytology or, better yet, a cutting needle\nfor histopathological diagnosis. Intraoperative ultrasound\n(US) facilitates lesion detection/localisation in the pancreas\nand liver and is mandatory before pancreatic resection in\nMEN1 syndrome patients.\nImaging by 68Ga/64Cu-DOTA-somatostatin analogue (SSA)\npositron emission tomography (PET) in combination with CT\n(PET-CT) provides high sensitivity for imaging of most types of\nNET lesions and should be part of the tumour staging, pre-\noperative imaging and restaging [IV, A].12 SSTR scintigraphy\n(SRS) should be carried out when PET-CT is not available but is\nconsiderably less sensitive [IV, B]. SRS should include cross-\nsectional imaging by single photon emission CT (SPECT)\ntogether with CT (SPECT-CT). The strength of a PET-CT is a\nhigher detection rate of lymph node, bone and peritoneal\nlesions as well as unknown primary tumours.\nThe sensitivity to detect NET disease by 68Ga-DOTA-SSA-\nPET-CT is 92% (range 64%e100%) and speciﬁcity 95% (range\n83%e100%).28 The sensitivity to detect pancreatic and\nduodenal NETs is 92% and the speciﬁcity 83%,28 and the\ncorresponding values for bone metastases are 97%e100%\nand 92%e100%.28 The use of PET with [18F]ﬂuoro-deoxy-\nglucose (FDG) is optional in NENs. FDG is the tracer of choice\nfor G3 and high G2 NETs, which generally have higher glucose\nmetabolism and less SSTR expression than the low-grade\nNETs, for which the situation is usually the reverse.29 Com-\nbined SSTR imaging and FDG-PET-CT has been shown to be\ncomplementary for lesion detection. Findings of FDG-\npositive NETs at PET-CT indicate worse prognosis.29e31\nThe author panel believes that optimal diagnostic and\nprognostic information can be achieved by submitting all\nNET G2/G3 patients to PET-CT with both FDG and 68Ga-\nTable 3.

In functional NETs, clinical\nsymptoms should be managed before any intervention\n[IV, A].\nPan-NETs\nPreoperative evaluation of localised Pan-NETs should take\ninto account tumour size, the presence of unspeciﬁc\nsymptoms, functional activity, localisation of the lesion and\nsigns of local invasiveness (Figure 1).\nSeveral studies demonstrated the safety of a watch-and-\nwait strategy instead of surgery for asymptomatic NF-Pan-\nNETs \u00042 cm.32,33 Nevertheless, the shortness of follow-up\nand the absence of prospective studies still suggest a\ncautious attitude towards this approach.\nCurrently, a conservative management of incidentally\ndiscovered Pan-NETs \u00042 cm, consisting of a yearly high-\nquality imaging, is suggested for elderly patients, in the\npresence of important comorbidities and when a deep\nlocalisation in the head of the pancreas allows only a\npancreaticoduodenectomy [IV, B].33 Surgery is recom-\nmended for young patients and in cases when signs of local\ninvasiveness (e.g. dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/\nor presence of jaundice and/or suspicion of nodal involve-\nment) are present. In the latter condition, a standard\npancreatectomy\nwith\nlymphadenectomy\nis\nmandatory,\nwhereas a parenchyma-sparing resection (e.g. enucleation\nor central pancreatectomy) should be routinely considered\nwhen the indication for surgery is related to long life\nexpectancy. Moreover, surgery is mandatory in the pres-\nence of functioning Pan-NETs irrespective of tumour size.\nCurative resection of localised Pan-NETs seems generally\nassociated with an improved long-term survival and a low\nrisk of recurrence.34 A standard pancreatectomy (pan-\ncreatico-duodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy) with\nFigure 1.

Enucleation may represent an alternative\napproach to standard pancreatectomy in selected cases.36\nFunctioning Pan-NETs \u00042 cm (e.g. insulinomas) represent\nideal lesions to be enucleated, given that they are safely\ndistant from the main pancreatic duct. The role of enucle-\nation for NF-Pan-NETs is currently limited to selected\npatients with small lesions in whom a watch-and-wait\nmanagement is contraindicated.\nSurgery may also play a role in the presence of\nborderline or locally advanced Pan-NETs. Pancreatectomy\nwith vascular resection is associated with improved out-\ncomes and it should be carefully considered in the\npresence of portal and/or superior mesenteric vein in-\nvasion. The presence of other high-risk features (e.g. large\ntumour size and/or high-grade Pan-NEC G3) should\ndiscourage an upfront surgical approach [IV, A]. Despite\nthe lack of evidence, in selected patients with high-risk\nfeatures, a neoadjuvant treatment may be considered.\nThe role of surgery for localised Pan-NEC G3 is still\ncontroversial, as upfront surgery may not have a clear\nbeneﬁt in terms of survival.37\nFor Pan-NETs in patients affected by MEN1 syndrome, see\nSection 1 of supplementary Material, available at Annals of\nOncology online.\nSI-NETs\nMacroscopic radical resection of localised SI-NETs reduces\nthe risk of intestinal complications (bowel obstruction and\nischaemia), is associated with improved outcomes38 and is\nrecommended along with systematic mesenteric lympha-\ndenectomy [IV, A] (Figure 2). Surgical indication for SI-NETs\nis inﬂuenced by the multifocality of these lesions and by the\nhigh likelihood of nodal involvement.39 During surgery for\nSI-NETs, an accurate palpation of the entire intestine and a\nsystematic\nlymphadenectomy\n(at\nleast\n8\nnodes)\nare\nmandatory.39,40 The frequent presentation at an emergency\nsetting as well as the rarity of the disease increase the risk\nof an inadequate surgical resection. Surgery is also generally\nrecommended in the presence of locally advanced SI-NETs,\nas the presence of a large mesenteric mass can cause acute\nor chronic intestinal obstruction and/or localised/diffuse\nintestinal ischaemia [V, B]. In these cases, a macroscopic\nradical resection of primary SI-NETs and regional lymph\nnodes can be achieved in \u000480% of cases if carried out by\nexperienced surgeons.40\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Surgery is the treatment of choice for local or locore-\ngional\ndisease\nin\nNET\nG1\nand\nG2.\nBefore\nany\nFigure 2.

GEP-NET LMs are frequently\nmore extensive than those which are identiﬁed, even\nintraoperatively, and a real curative resection is difﬁcult to\nachieve. The role of palliative resection is controversial\nwhen multiple, unresectable LMs are present. Primary site\nand presence of symptoms are important factors to be\nconsidered before planning a possible palliative surgical\nresection.\nPalliative resection of primary SI-NETs in advanced dis-\nease is generally indicated for preventing complications\nrelated to bowel obstruction or intestinal ischaemia [IV, C].\nHowever, it is controversial if primary tumour removal in\npatients with stage IV disease translates to an improvement\nin\nsurvival.\nA\nrecent\nlarge\nsingle-centre\nexperience\ndemonstrated no survival beneﬁt in patients with stage IV\ndisease\nafter\nprophylactic\npalliative\nSI-NET\nresection,\ncompared with no or delayed resection when needed.44\nThe role of debulking surgery in advanced NF-GEP-NETs is\nunclear.38,41 Debulking surgery is recommended for allevi-\nating symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome (CS) in patients\naffected by metastatic functioning SI-NETs [IV, B]. In those\npatients\nwith\nsymptoms\nrelated\nto\ntumour\nburden,\ndebulking surgery may also be of beneﬁt.\nPatients with high tumour burden of functioning Pan-\nNETs may beneﬁt from debulking surgery [e.g. insulinoma,\nvasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)oma], and surgery is\ngenerally recommended for this indication [IV, B]. The need\nfor palliative resection of NF-Pan-NETs is debated, as the\nrisk of tumour-related symptoms is low and is not consid-\nered in patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B]. Despite this, recent\nevidence from retrospective series suggested that primary\nPan-NET resection is associated with better long-term\noutcomes.45\nNevertheless,\nthe\npotential\nadvantage\nof\npalliative\nsurgery, either primary tumour resection or debulking\nsurgery in advanced GEP-NETs is controversial in terms of\nsurvival and underlies the bias of preselection of better\nprognosis patients for surgery.\nLiver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs when the following\ncriteria are met: absence of extrahepatic disease, histo-\nlogical conﬁrmation of a well-differentiated (G1/G2, Ki-67\n<10%) NET, previous removal of primary tumour, meta-\nstatic diffusion <50% of the total liver volume, stable dis-\nease in response to therapy for at least 6 months before\ntransplant consideration and age <60 years [IV, B].20 In\nthese selected patients with good baseline prognostic\nfactors, a 5-year OS of 69%e97.2% has been reported.46\nLiver transplantation is preferably considered in patients\nwith functioning tumours (CS refractory to systemic thera-\npies due to high liver tumour burden and in those affected\nby SI-NETs who usually exhibit a more favourable prog-\nnosis). Liver transplantation should be thoroughly discussed\nwithin a NET-dedicated multidisciplinary team, carefully\nconsidering all the alternative therapeutic options.\nIn patients with LMs who are ineligible for complete\nsurgical\nresection,\nvascular\nand\nablative\nlocoregional\nmodalities can be considered as an alternative to surgery.\nLocoregional therapies are discussed in detail in Section 2 of\nsupplementary Material, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline. Locoregional treatments can also be considered as\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].

However, in aggressive NENs (NEC\nG3), adjuvant therapy with platinum-based chemotherapy\n(ChT) can be considered [V, C]. Prospective clinical trials are\nwarranted.\nMedical therapy\nThe goal of systemic therapy is to control the tumour-\nassociated clinical symptoms and the tumour growth [I, A].\nTreatment for symptom control. The use of SSAs (octreo-\ntide, lanreotide) is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in functioning\nNETs.47 Improvement of ﬂushing and diarrhoea is achieved\nin 70%e80% of patients by using slow-release formulations\n[I, A]. SSAs are in general well tolerated except for mostly\ntransient GI side-effects (diarrhoea, abdominal discomfort,\nﬂatulence, nausea). In case of radiological stable disease or\nslow growth and worsening CS, it is common practice to\nincrease the SSA dose to greater than the standard dose\n[octreotide long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg intramuscular\n(i.m.) once every 4 weeks (q4w), lanreotide autogel (AG)\n120 mg subcutaneous (s.c.) q4w] by shortening the injec-\ntion interval to 3 or even 2 weeks of long-acting SSAs to\nalleviate symptoms48 although sufﬁcient prospective data\nare lacking to support this approach [IV, C]. Rescue s.c.\noctreotide injections are used alternatively, particularly in\ncases of intermittently increased symptoms. Pasireotide\nLAR, a universal ligand to SSTR, may be considered off-label\nbased on its efﬁcacy in subsets of patients with CS when\nestablished options failed.49 Furthermore, interferon alpha\n(IFN-a) is approved for symptom control (3e5 million IU s.c.\nthree times weekly) with similar efﬁcacy compared with\nSSA, but it is usually used in second-line as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA in patients with refractory syndrome,\ndue to its less favourable toxicity proﬁle (fatigue, weight\nloss and, more rarely, depression) [II, B].50\nTelotristat ethyl is an oral inhibitor of tryptophan\nhydroxylase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of\nserotonin, that has demonstrated a signiﬁcant improve-\nment in the number of bowel movements in a phase III\ntrial (TELESTAR) with 135 patients with refractory CS\ndiarrhoea (\u00054 bowel movements per day) compared with\nplacebo. Durable response (deﬁned as \u000530% improvement\nin bowel movements for >50% of the 12-week core study\nperiod) occurred in 44% and 42% of the patients treated\nwith 250 mg or 500 mg three times a day (t.i.d.),\nrespectively.51 A second placebo-controlled trial (TELE-\nCAST) including patients with less frequent bowel move-\nments supports the efﬁcacy and good tolerability of\ntelotristat ethyl. Adverse effects include mild elevations of\nliver enzymes. Depression-related events and nausea were\nobserved at higher doses.52 Patients with durable response\nshowed signiﬁcant and/or meaningful improvements in\nglobal quality of life (QoL), as well as nausea, pain,\ndiarrhoea and other GI symptoms.53 Telotristat ethyl (250\nmg t.i.d.) is approved for treatment of diarrhoea associ-\nated with CS in patients insufﬁciently controlled with SSA\nand can be recommended for this indication as an add-on\ntreatment to SSA [I, A].\nIn progressive disease, peptide receptor radionuclide\ntherapy (PRRT) may be considered to improve symptoms\n[II,\nB],\nalthough\nefﬁcacy\nmay\nnot\nbe\ndurable\n(Figure 3).54,55 With regard to the CS in the NETTER-1\nstudy, diarrhoea (present in 48% and 53% in the two\ntreatment arms) improved equally in 48% and in 43% of\nthe patients in the lutetium-177 (177Lu)-DOTATATE þ\noctreotide LAR 30 mg arm versus octreotide LAR 60 mg\narm, respectively; however, the time to deterioration\n(TDD) in QoL for diarrhoea after PRRT is signiﬁcantly\nbetter than the TTD in the control arm. There was no\ndifference in control of other symptoms including ﬂush-\ning.55 Noteworthy, acute aggravation of symptoms may\noccur during or after PRRT (such as worsening of hypo-\nglycaemia in insulinoma or diarrhoea in CS) and requires\ncareful observation [IV, A]. More data are needed to best\nselect treatment options in refractory CS, either dose\nescalation of SSA or add-on of another treatment (e.g.\ntelotristat ethyl, IFN-a, PRRT).\nOther treatment options for uncontrolled symptoms\ninclude everolimus, particularly in metastatic insulinoma,\nbut also refractory CS with progressive disease, although it\nis not approved in this indication by either the European\nMedicines Agency (EMA) or the Food and Drug Associa-\ntion (FDA) [IV, B]. Diazoxide is of value in metastatic\ninsulinoma, as it inhibits the secretion of insulin by\ntumour cells; SSA should be used under surveillance for\nthe risk of worsening hypoglycaemia. Metastatic gas-\ntrinoma may be well controlled with proton pump in-\nhibitors (PPIs) alone over the long term; in uncontrolled\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome, SSAs may be used.56 SSAs are\na standard of care in patients with other functioning Pan-\nNETs such as NET secreting VIP, glucagon and other\nbioactive compounds (Table 3). PRRT is an effective\ntreatment for symptom control in functional Pan-NETs\nrefractory to SSA.57\nAntiproliferative treatment. Predictive factors for therapy\nselection are lacking. The choice of antiproliferative treat-\nment is based on pathological and clinical features, tumour\nextent, growth behaviour and SSTR imaging. Furthermore,\nthe sequential use of drugs is impacted by the evidence\nlevel of drug activity, patient comorbidities and accessibility\nto drugs in different countries.\nAntiproliferative\nmedical\ntreatment\noptions\ninclude\ntargeted drugs and systemic ChT. SSAs and IFN-a (also\nnamed biotherapy) are the oldest targeted drugs used in\nNETs while novel targeted drugs, such as the mammalian\ntarget of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus and the\nmultiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sunitinib, have been\nintroduced more recently in the management of NETs.

SSAs are an established anti-\nproliferative therapy in metastatic GEP-NETs, based on two\nplacebo-controlled trials. Most frequently, they are used in\nﬁrst-line treatment, based on their modest activity and the\nsettings in which they have been studied. Overall response\nrates (ORRs) are low (<5%). The PROMID study showed\nprolongation of time to tumour progression (TTP) in\ntherapy-naive advanced metastatic midgut NETs (mostly G1\nand with low tumour burden) by 8.3 months; TTP with\noctreotide LAR 30 mg was 14.3 months and 6 months with\nplacebo.58\nThe CLARINET study demonstrated efﬁcacy not only in\nmidgut but also in Pan-NETs and NETs with high liver\ntumour burden (>25%), and NET G2 with a Ki-67 of \u000410%.\nMost patients (96%) had stable disease at study onset. The\nmedian progression-free survival (PFS) was not reached\nwith lanreotide (>27 months) and was 18 months in the\nplacebo arm.59 The CLARINET extension study also showed\nefﬁcacy in\nprogressive\ndisease\npatients with\nentero-\npancreatic NETs.60 There is very good long-term tolerability\nof both SSAs.47,58,59 SSAs can be recommended for tumour\ngrowth control in advanced SSTR-positive, slowly-growing\nGI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I, A; European Society\nfor Medical Oncology-Magnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale\n(ESMO-MCBS) v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A; ESMO-\nMCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide.

Positive SSTR status is generally required but is\nnot predictive of response, and SSTR imaging, particularly\nSRS, may miss small lesions of <1 cm in size. Since OS\nbeneﬁt is lacking in both SSA trials (CLARINET OS data are\nstill premature), probably due to high crossover rates,59,61\nand patients with indolent tumour behaviour may have\nstable disease for long time, a watch-and-wait strategy may\nbe applied, particularly in patients with NET G1 and/or low\ntumour burden (<10% liver tumour burden and absence of\nextra-abdominal disease) and stable disease [IV, A]. A\nwatch-and-wait approach is less frequently applied in\nadvanced Pan-NETs, the majority of the patients have NET\nG2 rather than NET G1.\nIFN-a. Based on long-term experience in NETs50 and\nsupported by recent results from a large randomised trial\n(including 35% midgut NET, median PFS 15.4 months for\nIFN-a and octreotide LAR),62 IFN-a can be considered for\nantiproliferative therapy if other treatment options have\nbeen exploited or are not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative status\non functional imaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where\nthere are fewer options as compared with Pan-NETs [IV, B].\nEverolimus. Everolimus has been studied extensively at a\ndose of 10 mg/day in various subtypes of NENs and has\nshown activity in Pan-, GI and pulmonary NETs. ORRs are\nlow (<10%) with everolimus. Three prospective studies\ndemonstrate a high disease control rate with everolimus in\nPan-NETs. Median PFS ranges from 9.7 months in heavily\npretreated patients (RADIANT-1 study) to 16.6 months in\npatients with few prior therapies.63,64\nThe registration trial (RADIANT-3 study) with 410 patients\n(including 40% therapy-naive patients) showed prolonga-\ntion of PFS by 6.4 months in advanced progressive Pan-\nNETs; median PFS was 11 months with everolimus and 4.6\nmonths with placebo.65 There was a trend toward OS\nbeneﬁt.66 Everolimus is recommended in progressive Pan-\nNET G1/G2 with or without prior ChT [I, A; ESMO-MCBS\nv1.1\nscore:\n3].\nAddition\nof\nthe\nSSA\npasireotide\nto\neverolimus did not provide a more durable beneﬁt\ncompared with everolimus alone in progressive Pan-NETs\n(COOPERATE-2 study)64; thus, combination therapy of SSA\nand everolimus is not recommended [II, D]; exceptions may\nbe functioning Pan-NETs. The positioning of everolimus in\nthe treatment algorithm for progressive Pan-NETs is further\nstudied in comparison with PRRT (COMPETE) and strepto-\nzotocin (STZ)-based ChT (SEQTOR) in ongoing clinical trials\n(NCT03049189, NCT02246127).\nThe efﬁcacy of everolimus in advanced NF-GI NETs with\npoor prognosis has been demonstrated by the RADIANT-4\ntrial.67 In this trial, 302 patients with GI and lung NETs\nwere\nincluded.\nMedian\nPFS\nwas\n11\nmonths\nwith\neverolimus and 3.9 months with placebo [hazard ratio\n(HR) 0.48]. There was a beneﬁt in terms of PFS prolon-\ngation in the GI subgroup [HR 0.56 (0.37e0.8)] and the\nlung NET subgroup [HR 0.5 (0.28e0.88)], and everolimus is\nEMA-approved for NF-GI and lung NETs. Everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive GI NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. The efﬁcacy derived from a\npost hoc analysis revealed heterogeneous response pat-\nterns among GI NETs with limited beneﬁt in indolent ileum\nNET.68 The author panel recommends the use of evero-\nlimus after PRRT in SI-NETs, when PRRT is available [V, A].\nHowever, the treatment sequence needs to be further\nstudied in the absence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\nHealth-related QoL evaluation in the overall study popu-\nlation, as measured by the Functional Assessment of\nCancer Therapy-General Questionnaire (FACT-G) did not\nidentify statistically signiﬁcant improvement with evero-\nlimus as compared with placebo.69,70\nThe use of everolimus is less clear in patients with\nadvanced NETs (carcinoids) associated with CS. Although a\nprolongation of PFS had been shown with everolimus in\ncombination with octreotide compared with placebo and\noctreotide, the result was not statistically signiﬁcant (by\ncentral reading) and everolimus is not registered for pa-\ntients with functioning NETs71; nevertheless, clinically\nbeneﬁcial effects have been reported in CS patients. Of\nnote, the ﬁnal OS results from the RADIANT-2 trial indicate a\ntrend toward unfavourable OS in the everolimus arm,\nalthough not statistically different from the placebo arm.\nEverolimus should be used with caution if considered for\npatients with CS.72\nMost frequent and relevant side-effects include stomatitis\n(>60%), diarrhoea (w30%), fatigue (w30%), infections\n(20%e29%), pneumonitis (12%e16%) and hyperglycaemia\n(10%e13%). A referral to the summary of product character-\nistics is recommended.73 Across all randomised everolimus\ntrials, drug-related adverse events were mostly manageable.\nHowever, around 60% required dose reduction or treatment\ninterruption.65,67,71 Life-threatening side-effects may occur in\nindividual patients (e.g. serious infections, sepsis, thrombo-\nembolic events) and require comprehensive patienteducation\nand regular careful follow-up investigations while patients are\non everolimus treatment.\nThere are no data to support the use of everolimus in\nNECs. However, small retrospective studies indicate some\nvalue in Pan-NET G3.74 Prospective phase II trials are\nongoing to assess the activity of everolimus in NET G3 and\nNECs (NCT02113800, NCT02248012).\nSunitinib. Sunitinib is the only multiple TKI that is EMA-\napproved in Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In\na randomised trial, sunitinib (37.5 mg/day) was compared\nwith placebo in 171 patients with advanced unresectable\nPan-NETs. A signiﬁcantly longer PFS (11.4 versus 5.5\nmonths) was noticed in favour of sunitinib [I, A].75 ORR was\n<10%; there was a trend toward an OS beneﬁt with\nsunitinib.76 While treatment was associated with modest\nside-effects, there was no signiﬁcant improvement in\nmultiple QoL domains, but worsening of diarrhoea with\nsunitinib versus placebo.77 Most frequent side-effects\ninclude diarrhoea (59%), nausea (45%), asthenia (34%),\nvomiting (34%) and fatigue (32%).

The drug has no\nindication in Pan-NECs due to the lack of data. Promising\ndata from a small phase II study in patients with NET G3 and\nNEC80 need to be validated in a larger study.\nThe appropriate sequencing of targeted drugs remains\nunclear and is mostly dependent on patient individual\nfactors including comorbidities and side-effects of targeted\ndrugs. There are no data to support the use of TKIs outside\nof clinical trials in GI NETs. However, recent data from a\nphase III placebo-controlled trial (SANET-ep) indicated\nactivity of surufatinib in extra-Pan-NETs in a Chinese pop-\nulation; surufatinib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared\nwith placebo in poor prognosis patients (>80% NET G2,\nmost frequent primary sites include the rectum and lung).81\nOngoing randomised controlled trials will provide more\ndata on TKIs in the future (see Section 3 of supplementary\nMaterial, available at Annals of Oncology online).\nSystemic ChT. The use of systemic ChT is recommended in\nadvanced Pan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A]. Results\nwith\nsystemic\nChT\nfor\nadvanced\nwell-differentiated\nnon-pancreatic NETs of the GI tract are poor; in a system-\natic review of patients with locally advanced or metastatic\nwell-differentiated G1/G2 GI NETs, the ORR was 11.5%\n(range 5.8%e17.2%)82; thus, ChT cannot be recommended\nin this setting [II, C]. Preselection of patients with higher\nprobability of response (e.g. higher Ki-67 in the range of\n15%e20%; signiﬁcant progression) might be associated\nwith beneﬁt from ChT. Systemic ChT may be considered\nunder these conditions in individual cases [V, C] (Figure 4).\nSystemic ChT is indicated in patients with non-resectable\nLMs and/or other distant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs\nusing a combination of STZ and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU) [II, A].\nORRs range between 35% and 40%. STZ-based ChT can be\nconsidered upfront in bulky disease without documented\nprior tumour progression. Recent retrospective analyses\nfrom European centres support the efﬁcacy demonstrated\nin RCTs carried out a long time ago.83e85 From retrospective\ntrials, temozolomide (TEM)-based ChT is active in Pan-NETs,\neither alone or combined with capecitabine (CAP)86;\npreliminary results from the prospective explorative two-\narm phase II trial of CAPTEM versus TEM in patients (n ¼\n145) with progressive Pan-NETs conﬁrm the efﬁcacy of TEM-\nbased ChT and suggest superiority of the combination\ntherapy (CAPTEM) compared with TEM alone with respect\nto PFS prolongation (22.7 months versus 14.4 months,\nrespectively; HR 0.58, P ¼ 0.023) [II, B].87 However, un-\nbalanced low-grade NETs and a longer time since diagnosis\nto therapy in favour of the combination arm may have\nimpacted the results. ORRs were not different with TEM\n(27.8%) versus CAPTEM (33.3%). The value of using O(6)-\nmethylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression\nor promoter methylation for preselection of patients is\ncontroversial.86,88\nIn cases of liver and/or other distant metastases from\nhigh-grade small or large-cell NEC G3 regardless of the\nprimary tumour origin combination ChT, using cisplatin/\netoposide or carboplatin/etoposide is recommended [III, A].\nAlthough ORRs may be high (30%e67%), median OS (mOS)\nis very limited (11e19 months). Early treatment onset is\ncrucial for the outcome. There is no established second-line\ntherapy for poorly differentiated NECs, but retrospective\nstudies from single centres indicate some efﬁcacy of TEM\nalone or in combination with CAP \u0006 bevacizumab, of 5-FU\nintravenously or CAP orally, combined with either oxalipla-\ntin or irinotecan [IV, B].89,90\nThe ORR with cisplatin-based ChT in NET G3 (in general,\nKi-67 is <55%) is much lower than in NEC and cisplatin/\netoposide is not recommended [IV, C]. Other options may\nbe considered including TEM, targeted drugs, PRRT in\nselected cases and STZ-based ChT in the case of Pan-NETs\n(Figure 4).\nPRRT. PRRT is a therapeutic option in progressive SSTR-\npositive NETs with homogenous SSTR expression (all NET\nlesions are positive) assessed by SSTR imaging.91,92 The two\npeptides most commonly used for PRRT are DOTATOC and\nDOTATATE. 177Lu is increasingly preferred to yttrium-90\n(90Y)-labelled SSA due to its much lower kidney toxicity\nand the possibility to carry out scintigraphy and thus\ndosimetry.\nRecently, the multicentre prospective phase III NETTER-1\ntrial has compared\n177Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8\nweeks, four intravenous infusions) in association with 30 mg\noctreotide LAR versus 60 mg octreotide LAR alone (every 4\nweeks) in 229 patients with metastatic well-differentiated\n(G1/G2) midgut NETs.93 Patients had progressive disease\nwithin a time frame of up to 3 years, and all had previously\nbeen treated with a standard dose of SSA. 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas superior to high-dose octreotide in terms of PFS (pri-\nmary end point). Median PFS (mPFS) with 177Lu-DOTATATE\nwas 28.4 months while it was 8.5 months with high-dose\noctreotide (HR for disease progression 0.214; 95% CI\n0.139e0.331).94 177Lu-DOTATATE was also associated with\na higher ORR (18% versus 3%) at 3 months after the fourth\nPRRT cycle. OS analysis is premature and indicates a trend\ntowards OS beneﬁt.93,94 Treatment was also associated with\nan improvement in symptoms and time to QoL deteriora-\ntion for global health status, physical functioning, fatigue,\npain and diarrhoea.55 PRRT can be recommended in pa-\ntients with midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs\nwho fulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT that are\nreported elsewhere [I, A].95 PRRT can also be considered at\nfurther therapy lines and in NETs from other sites than\nmidgut (Figure 4). Several phase II trials and observational\nstudies that recruited more than 1000 patients reported\noverall ORRs ranging between 4% and 39% in patients\nwith both functioning and NF-SSTR-positive NETs including\nNETs of the pancreas or GI tract outside the midgut\nregion.54,96e98\n177Lu-DOTATATE has been approved by\nM.

Results\nfrom RCTs with PRRT in Pan-NETs are lacking and molecular\ntargeted agents, such as everolimus or sunitinib, and sys-\ntemic ChT may therefore be preferred treatment choices,\nand PRRT after failure of these approved therapies [III, A]\n(Figure 4). However, one author (EPK) feels that PRRT\nshould be considered earlier in the treatment algorithm for\nSSTR-positive Pan-NETs.\nFor more information about selection criteria and PRRT\nbiomarkers, see Section 4 of supplementary Material,\navailable at Annals of Oncology online.\nThe published data on results of PRRT in NEN G3 of about\n280 patients in four retrospective studies with a number of\npatients ranging between 28e149 with Ki-67 >20% support\nthe therapeutic consideration of PRRT also in this group of\npatients.99e102 The overall results show disease control\nrates between 30% and 80%, PFS 9e23 months and OS 19e\n53 months. The results were signiﬁcantly better in patients\nFigure 4.

Locoregional therapy may be\nconsidered as an alternative approach to systemic therapies in SI- and Pan-NETs in liver disease only or predominant liver disease if extrahepatic lesions are stable.\nLocoregional therapy may also be considered early in NET G2 patients and advanced disease.\nIn Pan-NET G3 with moderate Ki-67, the treatment is similar to Pan-NET G2. The choice of ChT is mainly based on the tumour growth rate and Ki-67. STZ-based and TEM-\nbased therapies provide similar ORRs, although a comparative study is not available.\nSTZ has been combined with doxorubicin in Pan-NETs and produced high ORRs, but its use is limited due to potential cardiotoxicity to maximal cumulative dose of 400\nmg/m2.\nOne author (EPK) indicates that in SSTR-positive Pan-NET G1/G2 (Ki-67 <10%) PRRT might be considered after ﬁrst-line SSA or chemotherapy, equal to the choice of\ntargeted drugs and that in SI NET G2 (Ki-67>10%) PRRT could be considered equal to everolimus.\nGreen arrows indicate progressive disease.\n5-FU, 5-ﬂuorouracil; CAP, capecitabine; CAPTEM, capecitabine and temozolomide; ChT, chemotherapy; EVE, everolimus; FOLFIRI, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/irinotecan;\nFOLFOX, 5-ﬂuorouracil/leucovorin/oxaliplatin; GEP-NEN, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm; IFN-a, interferon alpha; NEC, neuroendocrine carcinoma;\nNET, neuroendocrine tumour; ORR, overall response rate; Pan-NET, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour; PRRT, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy; RECIST, response\nevaluation criteria in solid tumours; SI, small intestinal; SI-NET, small intestinal neuroendocrine tumour; SSA, somatostatin analogue; SSTR, somatostatin receptor; STZ,\nstreptozotocin; SUN, sunitinib; TEM, temozolomide.\na Slow tumour growth is deﬁned as stable disease by RECIST criteria for >1 year.\nb In liver-dominant disease.\nc If PRRT is not available, everolimus can be used as second-line therapy.\nd Rapid growth is deﬁned as RECIST progression within a year or less.\ne In liver-only disease or predominant liver disease.\nf If SSTR-positive.\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

However, it is controversial if primary tumour\nremoval in patients with stage IV disease translates to\nan improvement in survival.\n\u0002 Debulking surgery is recommended for alleviating symp-\ntoms in patients affected by metastatic functioning\nSI-NETs [IV, B].\n\u0002 In advanced Pan-NETs with uncontrolled symptoms\nrelated to hormone hypersecretion, debulking surgery\nmay be indicated [IV, B], but is generally not considered\nin patients with Ki-67 >10% [IV, B].\n\u0002 Liver transplantation may be a valid option in very\nselected patients with unresectable LMs [IV, B].\n\u0002 Locoregional treatments can be considered as an\nalternative therapy to LM resection in patients with\nresectable LMs [V, C].\n\u0002 Adjuvant therapy is not indicated in NET G1/G2 [IV, A].\nHowever, in aggressive NENs (NEC G3), adjuvant therapy\nwith platinum-based ChT may be considered [V, C].\n\u0002 Vascular and ablative locoregional treatments are valid\noptions for treatment of LMs, also in conjunction with\nother systemic therapies or in combination with surgery.\nThe choice of the procedures depends on the local\nexpertise, the extension and vascularisation of LMs and\nthe localisation of liver involvement [V, C].\n\u0002 In functional NETs, locoregional therapies should be\napplied early, following SSA therapy, to further improve\ncontrol of hormonal symptoms and prevent complica-\ntions (e.g. carcinoid crisis in serotonin-secreting NETs)\n[IV, A].\n\u0002 In patients with NF-NETs with disease limited to the liver,\nlocoregional therapies can be considered as an alterna-\ntive to systemic treatment [IV, B].\n\u0002 Systemic therapy should be administered to control\ntumour-associated clinical symptoms and tumour growth\n[I, A].\n\u0002 The use of SSAs is standard ﬁrst-line therapy in patients\nwith CS and some rare functional Pan-NETs (e.g. VIPoma,\nglucagonoma) [I, A].\n\u0002 In patients with refractory diarrhoea related to CS, telo-\ntristat ethyl can be recommended as an add-on treat-\nment to SSAs [I, A].\n\u0002 SSA dose increase is an alternative approach to improve\nsymptoms in refractory CS [IV, C], as well as the use of\nIFN-a, although it is less well tolerated [II, B].\n\u0002 In progressive disease, PRRT may have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on diarrhoea control in patients with CS [II, B].\n\u0002 Hormonal crisis may occur soon after PRRT and requires\ncareful information to be given to the patient before and\ndirectly after PRRT, and eventually admission and proper\ntreatment [IV, A].\n\u0002 The choice of antiproliferative treatment is based on\npathological and clinical features, tumour extent, growth\nbehaviour and SSTR imaging.\n\u0002 A watch-and-wait strategy may be followed in patients\nwith low Ki-67 (<2%), low tumour burden and stable\ndisease [IV, A], preferably in SI-NETs with long-term\nfavourable prognosis.\n\u0002 SSAs can be recommended as ﬁrst-line therapy for\ntumour growth control in advanced, slowly-growing\nSSTR-positive GI and Pan-NETs up to a Ki-67 of 10% [I,\nA; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3] for lanreotide and [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 2] for octreotide. Positive SSTR\nstatus is generally required but is not predictive of\nresponse.\n\u0002 IFN-a can be considered for antiproliferative therapy\nif other treatment options have been exploited or\nare not feasible (e.g. SSTR-negative on functional\nimaging), particularly in midgut NETs, where there\nare fewer therapy options compared with Pan-NETs\n[IV, B].\n\u0002 Everolimus is EMA-approved for progressive Pan-NET G1/\nG2 with or without prior ChT, for NF-GI and lung NETs [I, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3]. In GI NETs, everolimus should\nbe used in patients with clearly progressive disease [I, A].\n\u0002 The use of everolimus after PRRT is recommended in\nintestinal NETs, if PRRT is available [V, A], although the\ntreatment sequence needs to be further studied in the\nabsence of deﬁnite predictors of response.\n\u0002 The combination therapy of SSA and everolimus for an\nantiproliferative purpose is not recommended [II, D].\nM. Pavel et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 31\n- Issue 7\n- 2020\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2020.03.304\n855\n\n---\n\u0002 Sunitinib is one of the EMA-approved treatment options\nin advanced progressive Pan-NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1\nscore: 3].\n\u0002 Both sunitinib and everolimus cannot be recommended\nin NEC G3 outside of clinical trials [V, E].\n\u0002 The use of systemic ChT is recommended in advanced\nPan-NETs and in NEN G3 of any site [II, A].\nB In patients with non-resectable LMs and/or other\ndistant metastases from G1/G2 Pan-NETs, STZ/5-FU is\nrecommended in progressive disease [II, A].\nB TEM alone or in combination with CAP is recommen-\nded as alternative ChT in Pan-NETs [II, B].\nB Systemic ChT can also be recommended in bulky\ndisease\nwithout\nprior\ntumour\nprogression\nin\nPan-NETs [II, B].\nB Cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide is recommen-\nded standard ﬁrst-line ChT in NEC G3 [III, A]. There is\nno established second-line therapy, but different\nregimens [e.g. 5-FU/leucovorin/irinotecan (FOLFIRI),\n5-FU/leucovorin/oxaliplatin\n(FOLFOX),\nCAPTEM\n\u0006\nbevacizumab] may be considered [IV, B].\n\u0002 In NET G3, response rates to cisplatin/etoposide are\nlow, and the use of this combination is not recommen-\nded [IV, C].\n\u0002 ChT cannot be recommended in well-differentiated\nslowly growing NETs of the GI tract [II, C]; exceptions\nmay be rapidly progressive tumours or NET G2 with\nhigher Ki-67 close to NET G3 [V, C].\n\u0002 PRRT is recommended as second-line therapy in patients\nwith midgut NETs with disease progression on SSAs who\nfulﬁl the general requirements for PRRT [I, A].\n\u0002 177Lu-DOTATATE is EMA- and FDA-approved for patients\nwith midgut NETs [I, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4] and\nPan-NETs [III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4].\n\u0002 In Pan-NETs, PRRT should be used after failure of\napproved therapies [III, A].\n\u0002 In carefully selected patients, PRRT may be considered in\nNET G3 [IV, C].\n\u0002 SSA should be combined with PRRT in patients with\nfunctioning tumours (CS) to prevent increasing symp-\ntoms such as diarrhoea and/or ﬂushing and hormonal\ncrisis soon after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 It is also common practice to continue SSA beyond PRRT\nin functioning tumours, as a full resolution of CS-related\nsymptoms is rarely achieved after PRRT [II, A].\n\u0002 The combination of SSA with PRRT is not recommended\nin patients with NF-NETs, [IV, C] and it remains unclear if\nSSA should be continued after PRRT as a maintenance\ntherapy.\nPERSONALISED MEDICINE\nIn the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity of\ncomparative\nrandomised\ntrials,\ntherapy\nselection\nin\nadvanced non-resectable disease is frequently based on\nindividual patient clinical and pathological features and\nSSTR imaging [IV, A]. Several issues are unresolved: to\nconsider surgery upfront for potentially resectable LMs or\nsystemic\ntherapy,\nor\nlocoregional\ntherapies.\nAmong\nsystemic treatments, approved drugs should be used with\nhigher priority, although comorbidities and age may impact\ntreatment choices. The treatment selection should be based\non an interdisciplinary tumour board decision in experi-\nenced centres including experts familiar with the disease.\nRecently identiﬁed prognostic molecular markers may have\nan impact on therapy strategies in the future if validated in\nprospective trials. A recent meta-analysis identiﬁed a diag-\nnostic accuracy of a NET mRNA genomic biomarker (NETest)\nof 95%e96%; this marker seems to have a predictive value\nfor PRRT response and achievement of complete surgery.103\nRecommendation\n\u0002 In the absence of deﬁnite predictive markers and paucity\nof comparative randomised trials, therapy selection in\nadvanced disease is often based on individual patient clin-\nical and pathological features and SSTR imaging [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATION AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nFollow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional and\nSSTR imaging [V, B]. In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1\nand NET G2 with low Ki-67 (<5%), it is recommended that\nimaging is carried out every 6 months (CT or MRI), in NET\nG2 (Ki-67 >5%) every 3 months and in NEC G3 every 2e3\nmonths [V, C]. Similar staging intervals apply to advanced\ndisease. Follow-up should be life long, although the staging\nintervals can be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up (>5 years), except in G3 NEN, where\nshorter intervals should be kept. Late recurrences after 10e\n20 years have been described, although rare. In contrast,\nsmall localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix\nor\nrectum\ndo\nnot\nneed\nany\nfollow-up\nif\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nImaging with 68Ga/64Cu-SSTR-PET-CT, or if not available\nwith SSTR scintigraphy as a considerably less sensitive\nalternative, should be included in the follow-up and is\nrecommended after 12e36 months if expression of SSTR-2a\nhas been demonstrated on the tumour cells by previous\nSSTR imaging or IHC.91,92 In the follow-up, a re-biopsy of the\nliver or other disease site (in absence of LMs) may be\nconsidered under special circumstances, e.g. if a second\nmalignancy is suspected or the tumour growth behaviour is\ninconsistent with the known Ki-67 and warrants exclusion of\na NEC. Biochemical markers include CgA and speciﬁc bio-\nmarkers in functional tumours; if CgA is not elevated, NSE\nrepresents an alternative biomarker, mostly in NET G2 or\nNEN G3. There is no validated tumour marker for recurrence\ndetection; the NETest has potential to predict response to\nPRRT and detect residual disease after surgery and was\nsuperior to CgA in a validation study.104e106\nIn NEN G3 clinical symptoms (weight loss, fatigue; also\nindicative in G1 and G2) may indicate recurrence. NSE and\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be monitored in NEC;\nAnnals of Oncology\nM.

Conventional imaging\nincludes thoracic and abdominal scans every 2e3 months.\nFDG-PET may be required in case of suspected recurrence to\ndiscriminate lesions from unspeciﬁc ﬁndings; otherwise,\nhigh-resolution CT is the imaging method of choice, unless\nresection is considered in locally advanced NEN G3,\nwhere FDG-PET is mandatory to exclude distant metastatic\ndisease.\nRecommendations\n\u0002 Follow-up investigations should include clinical symptom\nmonitoring, biochemical parameters and conventional\nand SSTR imaging [V, B].\n\u0002 In patients with R0/R1-resected NET G1eG2, it is recom-\nmended that imaging is carried out every 3e6 months\n(CT or MRI), and in NEC G3 every 2e3 months [V, C].\nSimilar staging intervals apply to advanced disease.\n\u0002 Follow-up should be lifelong, although the staging inter-\nvals may be extended to 1e2 years with increasing\nlength of follow-up.\n\u0002 Small localised NET G1 (<1 cm in size) with origin in the\nappendix or rectum do not need any follow-up if\nR0-resected and in the absence of adverse histological\nfeatures [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThese Clinical Practice Guidelines were developed in\naccordance with the ESMO standard operating procedures\nfor Clinical Practice Guidelines development, http://www.\nesmo.org/Guidelines/ESMOGuidelines-Methodology.\nThe\nrelevant literature has been selected by the expert authors.\nAn ESMO-MCBS table with ESMO-MCBS scores is included\nin supplementary Table S4, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.107 Levels of evidence and grades of recommenda-\ntion have been applied using the system shown in\nsupplementary Table S5, available at Annals of Oncology\nonline.108 Statements without grading were considered\njustiﬁed standard clinical practice by the experts and the\nESMO Faculty.

Patients with carcinoids are generally\nyounger, have a better prognosis and do not have a strong\nassociation with smoking, as compared with SCLC and\nLCNEC.1 The incidence of LC is very low, ranging from 0.2-2/\n100 000 persons/year in both the United States and\nEurope.2,3 Numbers are increasing, likely due to increased\nawareness and improved diagnostic techniques, although it\nmay also be a genuine overall increase in incidence.2,3 LCs\naccount for 20%-25% of all NETs and 1%-2% of all lung\ncancers. LCs prevail slightly more often in women than in\nmen. LCs occur during the ﬁfth or sixth decade of life for TC\nand a decade later for AC.4-10\nThC is an extremely rare tumour accounting for an age-\nadjusted rate of 0.02/100 000-0.18/100 000/year in the\nEuropean or USA populations, respectively.3,11 In the\nNetherlands cancer registry or the Surveillance, Epidemi-\nology and End Results (SEER) programme database, <0.5%\nof all neuroendocrine neoplasms were ThC, representing 5%\nof thymic tumours.3,11 The incidence of ThC is increasing in\nthe USA population.11 ThC prevails in men and the mean\nage at diagnosis is 55 years.1,11-13\nLC and ThC may also be present in multiple endocrine\nneoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome or when there is a\nfamily history of carcinoid tumours or diffuse pulmonary\nneuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) (Supplementary\nMaterial,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.\n2021.01.003).1,14-17\nRecommendation\n\u0001 The scarcity of LCs and ThCs justiﬁes the therapeutic\nmanagement of these patients by expert multidisci-\nplinary teams in centres grouped within networks (na-\ntional or European networks) for care and research\noptimisation [V, A].\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nLC is revealed by non-speciﬁc tumour-related respiratory\nsymptoms (mainly, central forms) or incidentally (mainly,\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, 6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Note: Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: August 2007, last\nupdate December 2020.

A minority of cases present with symp-\ntoms related to hormonal hypersecretion, including carci-\nnoid syndrome (CS), due to serotonin and other compound\nsecretions, Cushing’s syndrome (CuS), due to adrenocorti-\ncotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion and acromegaly, due to\ngrowth\nhormone-releasing\nhormone\n(GHRH)\nsecre-\ntion.5,7,18,19 In a recent large population-based study series\nof 3002 LC patients, CS was present in 229 patients (7.6%)\nat diagnosis.20\nDiagnosis is carried out with bronchoscopic technique,\ntransthoracic biopsy or, less frequently, by mediastinoscopy\nor\nendobronchial\nendoscopic\nultrasonography\n(EBUS)\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).\nSurgery may be carried out upfront after adequate\nmedical\npreparation\nin\nlocalised\nresectable\ntumours\nresembling LCs or in tumours considered at high risk of\nbleeding or hormonal crisis or when previous biopsy has\nfailed. Once the diagnosis is suspected, standardised char-\nacterisation of LC comprises several speciﬁc steps for eval-\nuation that are described in Table 1 [III, B].4-9,18,20-34\nThC is revealed by tumour-related symptoms, or due to\nfunctionally active tumours or by chance.11-13 Diagnostic\nprocedures, including core biopsy under ultrasonography\nguidance, or preferably through a thoracic computed tomog-\nraphy (CT) scan, or upfront surgery following the guidelines for\nthymic tumour diagnosis, should be carried out.35 The authors\nrecommend standardised characterisation of ThC in multidis-\nciplinary expert centres as described in Table 1 [III, B].11,12,32-37\nThe histopathological diagnosis of LC or ThC relies on\ncharacteristic morphological features and on the demon-\nstration of the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour through\nthe immunodetection of a panel of markers including at least\nchromogranin A (CgA) and synaptophysin, which are usually\nexpressed in all carcinoids. This might be expanded to other\nmarkers such as CD56.1 Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1)\nmay be useful in well-differentiated tumours only, when\npositive, to suggest the lung origin of metastatic tumours.1\nTCs and ACs are distinguished (Supplementary Table S1,\navailable at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003),\non the basis of mitotic count and presence or absence of\nnecrosis.1 While Ki-67 index is not included in the WHO\ncriteria, the WHO acknowledges that Ki-67 index might be\nuseful for the differential diagnosis between well- or poorly-\ndifferentiated NETs (Supplementary Table S1, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).1 Carcinoids\nare characterised by mutations involving either MEN-1 or\nother genes encoding chromatin-remodelling proteins.38,39\nTP53 and particularly RB1 gene alterations, which are rare\nmolecular events in carcinoids, might be potential tools to\ndiscriminate between well or poorly differentiated categories\nin difﬁcult cases like the recently identiﬁed LC with high\nproliferative features.

Insufﬁcient accuracy of CgA (30%-\n60% at the metastatic stage) makes research on new\nbiomarkers critical. Among these, a multianalyte molecular\nassay [51 transcripts; neuroendocrine tumor test (NETest)]\nis currently under development with potentially better\nsensitivity, but uncertainties remain regarding its positive\npredictive value and role as a prognostic marker for LC.22\nThe application of the 8th Edition of the Union for\nInternational\nCancer\nControl\n(UICC)\nTNM\nstaging\n(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) is recommended even\nif not speciﬁc to LCs.31,46,47 More than 80% of LCs are\ndiagnosed at TNM stage I or II.4,5-7,46 The most common\nsites of metastasis include liver, bone and lung. The diversity\nof metastatic sites and the potential overestimation of lung\nmetastasis and underestimation of brain metastasis must be\ntaken into account.46,47 The WHO classiﬁcation and patho-\nlogical TNM (pTNM) staging are intricate.5,21,48 In a recent\nstudy in which patients underwent \u000310 lymph node\nresection, frequency of positive lymph nodes was 17%\n(including 6% N2-N3) or 46% (including 23% N2-N3) in case\nof TC or AC, respectively.48\nMost ThCs are diagnosed at advanced-stage Masaokae\nKoga (Supplementary Table S5, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) or TNM stage III or\nIV.11,12,32 The most common sites for metastases include the\npleura, pericardium, bone, lung and liver.\nIn LCs, overall survival (OS) is mainly inﬂuenced by WHO\npathology and the pTNM classiﬁcations.1,5,21,45-49 In stage I,\nII, III or IV LC patients, 10-year disease-speciﬁc survival is\n96%, 85%, 81%, 59% and 88%, 75%, 47%, 18%, in TC or AC,\nrespectively, showing the major prognostic inﬂuence of the\nWHO classiﬁcation.46\nAfter resection, WHO classiﬁcation and pathological lymph\nnode staging (pN) status constitute the two main prognostic\nparameters (Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).4,5,9,21,45,48-51\nAlthough\nKi-67 index is considered a promising prognostic marker by\nthe whole author panel, its technique of evaluation and the\nmost accurate thresholds remain a matter of debate; more-\nover, no deﬁnitive validation of its added value to WHO and\npTNM classiﬁcations has been provided so far in large series\nof LCs.18,28,45,52,53 At the metastatic stage, WHO classiﬁcation,\nperformance status, CgA levels, tumour burden and so-\nmatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) uptake, as well as tumour\ngrowth slope and the functioning syndrome, should be taken\ninto account for adequate risk assessment [IV, B].47 Prolonged\nsurvival of the majority of patients with LCs (including a 60%\n5-year OS for metastatic LC) makes adjusted toxicity proﬁle of\ntherapeutic interventions critical [V, A].47\nThe prognosis of patients with thymic NETs remains poor:\nin retrospective series, 5- or 10-year OS was 28%-72% or\n26%-60%, respectively.11-14,33 Based on a few large, retro-\nspective thymic NETs series, OS is inﬂuenced by stage,\nmainly\ntumour\nsize\nand\ncompleteness\nof\nresection\n(Supplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).11-13,32,33,36 No speciﬁc staging\nsystem has yet been validated for ThC. The authors there-\nfore recommend the use of both staging systems (TNM,\nMasaokaeKoga) together with the WHO classiﬁcation and\nresection status for adequate prognostic stratiﬁcation.1\nRecommendations\n\u0001 WHO and pTNM classiﬁcations constitute the basis of\nthe prognostic classiﬁcation [II, B]\n\u0001 i.v. contrast-enhanced cross-sectional conventional imag-\ning including liver late arterial phase and PET-CT with\n68Ga-labelled SSAs constitute the basis of TNM evalua-\ntion [II, B]\n\u0001 Speciﬁc prognostic factors including tumour growth rate\nor presence of functioning syndromes are taken into ac-\ncount in advanced-stage LCs and ThCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Prolonged survival of most patients with LCs makes\nadjusted toxicity proﬁle of therapeutic interventions crit-\nical [V, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE,\nLOCAL RECURRENCE AND ADJUVANT THERAPY\nLocal/locoregional disease treatment\nControl of a functioning syndrome must be considered\nbefore any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]. Surgery\nrepresents the treatment of choice for LCs (both TCs and\nACs), even in the case of N2 lymph nodal metastases [IV,\nA].54 The surgical approach depends on tumour size, loca-\ntion and preoperative biopsy specimen assessment. The\nchoice of open surgery or minimally invasive approaches\nwill depend on the experience of the surgeon. Patients with\nsmall peripheral nodules may be candidates for minimally\ninvasive access including lung resection and lymph node\ndissection (usually a video-assisted lobectomy/segmentec-\ntomy). The surgical access for centrally located tumours,\nthose with suspected/proven metastatic lymph nodes,\nusually requires thoracotomy, depending on the surgeon’s\nexpertise.\nAnatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy,\nlobectomy,\nbilobectomy,\npneumonectomy)\nand\nlymph\nnode resection (with a minimum of six nodal stations:\nthree hilar and three mediastinaldalso including subcarinal\nstationdas recommended by the European Society of\nThoracic Surgery for non-small-cell lung cancer) is the\npreferred extent of resection [IV, B]. Indeed, wedge resec-\ntion may increase the risk of tumour recurrences, especially\nin N-positive TC or intermediate-grade ACs.4,5,55,56 In ACs,\nE. Baudin et al.\nAnnals of Oncology\nVolume 32\n- Issue 4\n- 2021\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003\n441\n\n---\nbut also in N-positive TCs, lobectomy is reported as superior\nto segmentectomy in terms of OS in some, but not\nall.5,7,8,18,51,54,55,57,58 Bronchoplastic procedures (e.g. sleeve\nresections) are preferred for suitable centrally located tu-\nmours, with the aim of avoiding pneumonectomy [IV B].\nTransfer of patients to specialist centres for sleeve resection\nshould be discussed [IV, B]. Frozen sections of bronchial and\nvascular margins are recommended to rule out tumour\ninvolvement of resection margins, a condition that conse-\nquently imposes a greater pulmonary resection. Systematic\nlymph node dissection is recommended as lymph node\nmetastases may be observed in up to 27% of TCs and in up\nto 47% of ACs, and lymph node resection inﬂuences the\nprognosis and the modality of follow-up5,45,48,49,56 [IV, B].\nR0 resection is achieved in >85% of cases.7,10\nIn case of distal lung parenchyma destruction, there is an\noption for endobronchial resection to relieve the obstruc-\ntion, followed by reassessment and deﬁnitive surgery a few\nweeks later.\nWatchful radiological follow-up, as an alternative to\nsurgery, may be considered in case of cT1N0 carcinoid\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH, but also in MEN-1 patients\nand patients with comorbid conditions, due to the indo-\nlent course of most tumours [IV, C]. Rarely, carcinoids\nwithin the setting of DIPNECH may progress and be\nconsidered\nfor\nsublobar\nresection\n(including\nwedge\nresection), especially in case of large tumour size and/or\npresence of lymph nodes and/or uncontrolled functioning\nsyndrome, as a potential alternative to anatomical surgery\nin these patients to preserve lung function; medical op-\ntions (SSAs) or nonsurgical locoregional therapeutic pro-\ncedures may also constitute potential alternatives to be\ndiscussed case by case [V, C].14,17,24 Patients with non-\nDIPNECH or non-MEN-1 multifocal LC primaries may\nconstitute a distinct entity which may beneﬁt from a\nsimilar management [V, C].59\nUpfront surgery can be offered for all ThCs deemed\nradically resectable [IV, B]. Resectability judgement is\nmostly based on the surgeon’s expertise in thymic surgery.\nProspective registration of these cases is recommended.\nMedian sternotomy is the standard surgical approach and\nless invasive forms of access (video-assisted, robotic-\nassisted) are currently being investigated; in selected\ncases (tumours invasive to the lung, great vessels or with\npleural/pericardial implants), a combined approach (ster-\nnotomy plus anterior thoracotomy) or a thoracotomy are\nrequired to achieve a complete tumour resection. Palliative\nsurgery is not recommended. Lymphadenectomy has his-\ntorically rarely been carried out at the time of resection of\nthymic tumours; however, the latest UICC TNM staging\nsystem recommends that locoregional lymph nodal dissec-\ntion should be carried out also during ThC resection.60 Due\nto the poor prognosis of ThC, prophylactic thymectomy\ncould be discussed in young male adult patients with MEN-\n1 at the time of initial or recurrent parathyroidectomy,\nespecially in families with aggressive thymic tumours [V,\nC];14,15,61\nthe\nbest\nsurgical\napproach\nmay\ninclude\ncervicotomy and upper sternal split or other surgical pro-\ncedures to avoid incomplete thymic resection.\nLocal recurrence therapy\nAfter a median follow-up of 54-121 months, recurrences\noccur in up to 7% of TCs and up to 35% of ACs.4,7,18,53,54\nOne-third are local recurrences.\nIn case of local recurrence, surgical resection with radical\nintent is recommended when technically feasible. In patients\nwith signiﬁcant comorbidity or high operative risk, palliative\nlocoregional procedures or watchful follow-up may constitute\nan alternative (Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003).54,62\nAdjuvant therapy\nLarge retrospective studies have reported no beneﬁt of\nadjuvant therapy in both TCs and ACs.5,8-10,18 Therefore, the\nauthors do not recommend routine adjuvant therapy in LCs,\n[IV, D] for TC; [IV, C] for AC (Figure 1). However, it may be\nconsidered in selected ﬁt patients with particularly high risk\nof relapse (i.e. AC N2) after multidisciplinary discussion [IV,\nC]. We recommend prospective registration of these cases.\nMedical options, mainly cytotoxic chemotherapy (ChT) [plus\nor minus radiotherapy (RT)], cited in these guidelines,\nshould be considered ﬁrst.\nAvailable literature suggests no beneﬁt from adjuvant\ntherapy in ThCs [V, C].11-13,32 The majority of the author\npanel suggests individually discussing postoperative thera-\npies, including RT and/or systemic therapies (with options\ndiscussed in these guidelines), with patients with advanced-\nstage R0 or R1-2 resection [V, C] (Figure 2).\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Control of a functioning syndrome must be considered\nbefore any invasive therapeutic intervention [V, A]\n\u0001 An anatomic pulmonary resection (e.g. segmentectomy,\nlobectomy, bilobectomy) or bronchoplastic procedures\n(e.g. sleeve resections) together with lymph node dissec-\ntion are recommended in localised LCs [IV, B]\n\u0001 Patients with cT1N0 LC within the setting of DIPNECH or\nMEN-1 syndromes, or with comorbid conditions, may\nbeneﬁt from an initial radiological follow-up without\ntreatment to determine the growth rate.

The most\nfrequent functioning syndrome is CS in LC, which requires\nannual echocardiography screening for carcinoid heart dis-\nease, when present or in case of increased 5-HIAA levels [V,\nC].60 In addition, prospective studies are expected to deter-\nmine the added value of N-terminal pro hormone B-type\nnatriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in the detection of carcinoid\nheart disease. In contrast, CS is rare in ThC. Based on\napproval and recommendations in gastroenteropancreatic\n(GEP) NET patients with CS, we recommend long-acting SSAs\nas ﬁrst-line symptomatic treatment of CS [V, B].61,63-65 SSAs\nare also an option in DIPNECH patients presenting with res-\npiratory symptoms.65 Among second-line options described\nin Figure 3 and Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003,64-71\nonly\ntelotristat\nethyl has been approved by the European Medicines Agency\n(EMA) and the United States Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA) for the treatment of the diarrhoea of refractory CS.

Palliative surgery\nor radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or cryoablation or endo-\nbronchial treatment (EBT) of the primary tumour are oc-\ncasionally considered in cases of advanced disease at risk of\nlocal events or refractory CS [V, B]. More frequently, liver,\nbone and lung metastases represent potential targets for\nsuch strategies with the triple objectives of reducing the\nlocoregional risks, the primary tumour and the secretory\nburden (Figures 3 and 4). Such multiple locoregional man-\nagement may represent the only anti-tumour strategy in\npatients with slowly progressive tumours (Figure 4 and\nSupplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.annonc.2021.01.003) [V, B].67,68,73-75\nRecommendations\n\u0001 Palliative surgery or locoregional procedures (RFA, cryoa-\nblation, EBT) of the primary tumour are occasionally\nconsidered in cases of advanced disease at risk of local\nevents or refractory CS [V, B]\n\u0001 Multiple locoregional therapies including surgery, com-\nbined or not with SSAs, are recommended to decrease\nthe tumour burden, to control hormonal secretions\nand to prevent local complications, as a ﬁrst-line thera-\npeutic approach in patients with advanced slowly pro-\ngressing LC [V, B].\nSystemic anti-tumour therapy\nSystemic anti-tumour therapies of patients with advanced\nLC are various, including SSAs, ChT, everolimus, peptide\nreceptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and interferon-a (IFN-\na) (Figure 4). These systemic therapies should be discussed\nwithin expert multidisciplinary teams for patients with\nmorphologically progressive tumours, high tumour burden\nor refractory functioning syndromes. No speciﬁc phase III\ntrial for LC exclusively has been published so far, therefore\nevidence comes mostly from retrospective analyses, less\nfrom phase II, single-arm trials, and sporadically from\nrandomised phase II or subgroups of phase III trials that\nenrolled a majority of GEP-NET patients. Everolimus is the\nonly treatment approved by the FDA and the EMA for LC.\nBased on the very limited data available in advanced ThC,\nwe recommend applying the same strategy as for LC.\nSSAs\nOctreotide [long-acting release (LAR) 30 mg] and lanreotide\n(120 mg) are the two SSAs most commonly used in clinical\npractice. Both showed antiproliferative activity and gains in\ntime to progression or progression-free survival (PFS) in\nplacebo-controlled, phase III trials enrolling good prognostic\nor\nslowly\nprogressive\nGEP-NETs,64\nwhere\nthey\nwere\napproved by the FDA and EMA for antiproliferative pur-\nposes. The placebo-controlled, randomised phase III trial,\nwhich evaluated lanreotide 120 mg in advanced LC, was\nstopped\nfor\ninsufﬁcient\nenrolment\n(SPINET\ntrial\nNCT02683941). Therefore, the feasibility of phase III trials in\nLC remains an issue. Two dedicated retrospective case series\nreported potential positive impact of SSAs, with a PFS of 17\nand 11 months, respectively.76,77 In the single, published,\nrandomised phase II LUNA trial, pasireotide 60 mg every 4\nweeks, in ﬁrst or second line after standard SSA therapy,\nachieved a 39% progression-free rate (PFR) at 9 months, in\na series of 41 LCs or ThCs with Response Evaluation Criteria\nin Solid Tumours (RECIST) progression before enrolment\n(LUNA study). The PFR was not signiﬁcantly different from\nthat achieved with everolimus alone.20 On this basis, the\nauthors recommend SSA, for its better tolerability, as ﬁrst-\nline therapy in TC or slowly progressing somatostatin re-\nceptor (SSTR)-positive LC [IV, C].\nTargeted therapies\nEverolimus has been investigated in several clinical trials\nwhich included metastatic LCs and is currently the most\nstudied agent in LC.

In few cases, with high proliferative ACs (Ki-67 >20%) or rapid growth, platinum-based ChT might be\nconsidered upfront (alternatives or second lines include everolimus or PRRT, based on SRI results).\ne PRRT should be considered as an alternative to ChT in selected patients (refractory carcinoid syndrome, SRI homogenous positive tumour uptake on all RECIST-\nevaluable targets). PRRT may be considered ﬁrst line in a few SRI-positive patients with refractory carcinoid syndrome and progressing or bulky tumours.\nf IFN-a should be considered as alternative to ChT especially if refractory carcinoid syndrome.

It affects predominantly older,\nfair-skinned Caucasians and exhibits aggressive behaviour\nwith a high recurrence rate and a propensity for early\nmetastasis.1 Despite new advances in therapies for MCC,\nthe prognosis remains poor. With the incidence of MCC\nincreasing rapidly across Europe, prompt diagnosis and\neffective and harmonised management are imperative for\nimproving patient care.2\nThe European Parliament and the European Commission\nrecommend treating patients with rare cancers in centres\nlinked to the European Reference Network for Rare Adult\nSolid Cancers (EURACAN). In these referral centres with a\nhigh volume of MCC patients, the clinical experience of a\nmultidisciplinary team (MDT) specialising in skin cancers\nguarantees better treatment outcomes and access to\nclinical trials. Therefore, the objective of this guideline is to\nprovide a comprehensive reference for MCC, which is based\non a critical evaluation of current evidence and opinion of\nEuropean Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) experts in\npartnership with EURACAN.\nINCIDENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGY\nThe global incidence rates of MCC are difﬁcult to calculate\nbecause of its rarity, geographic and demographic vari-\nability and lack of large epidemiological studies.3 Since its\nﬁrst description in 1972, MCC incidence rates have\nsteadily increased, likely due to both the reﬁnements in\ndiagnostic capabilities and the progressively ageing pop-\nulation.4,5 The Surveillance of Rare Cancers in Europe\n(RARECARE) database reported the crude incidence esti-\nmate as 0.13 per 100 000 in 1995-2002.6 The incidence\nrate reported over time in the recent analysis of the\nSurveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data-\nbase showed that in 1986, incidence and mortality rates\nper 100 000 were 0.22 and 0.03, respectively; these rates\nincreased to 0.79 and 0.43, respectively, in 2011.7 The\nhighest incidence rates of MCC are in Australia, where the\nage-adjusted incidence rate reported in Queensland was\n1.6 per 100 000.8\n*Correspondence to: ESMO Guidelines Committee, ESMO Head Ofﬁce, Via\nGinevra 4, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland\nE-mail: clinicalguidelines@esmo.org (ESMO Guidelines Committee).\n5Approved by the ESMO Guidelines Committee: February 2024.\n2059-7029/© 2024 The Author(s).

In Australia, this\nis the opposite, with 80% UV- and 20% MCPyV-related.3\nDIAGNOSIS AND PATHOLOGY/MOLECULAR BIOLOGY\nClinical diagnosis\nThe clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional lymph nodes (LNs),\ncomorbid conditions and patient life expectancy. MCC\nclassically presents as a pink or red-violaceous, painless,\nﬁrm, rapidly growing, dome-shaped or red plaque skin\nlesion, ranging in size from 1 to 2 cm. It typically occurs in\nolder patients in sun-exposed areas of their bodies. The\npredominant sites of MCC localisation include the head and\nneck (45%), upper limbs (24%), lower limbs (10%) and trunk\nor other sites (<10%), while in 11% of cases, there is no\nidentiﬁable primary lesion. Ulceration may occur in more\nadvanced MCC lesions. MCC enlarges rapidly, metastasises\nin transit to the skin and/or to ﬁrst-echelon LNs (26% of\ncases at initial presentation) and then to higher-order nodal\nregions and distant sites such as bones, liver and brain (8%\nof cases at initial presentation).12 MCC may be mis-\ndiagnosed as squamous- or basal-cell carcinoma, amela-\nnotic melanoma, adnexal tumour, primary cutaneous B-cell\nlymphoma or skin disorders such as pyogenic granuloma\nand\ninﬂammatory\ndisorders.13\nSince\nMCC\nhas\nbeen\nobserved contiguous to, or intermingled with, other skin\ncancers, the detection of polymorphous vessels and/or\nmilky-red areas by dermatoscopy enhances the differential\ndiagnostic accuracy, especially for patients with multiple\nskin lesions.14\nAetiology and molecular biology\nDespite major advances in understanding MCC carcino-\ngenesis, the cellular origin of MCC is still unclear. MCC has\nbeen hypothesised to originate from dermal ﬁbroblasts,\npre-/pro-B cells, Merkel-cell precursors potentially derived\nfrom epidermal stem cells and hair follicle stem cells.15 MCC\ncarcinogenesis can be initiated in the cell of origin either by\nUV-mediated DNA damage caused by chronic exposure to\nsunlight or by integration of the MCPyV into the host\ngenome.16,17 MCPyV is a ubiquitous virus usually acquired\nduring childhood, as indicated by frequent seropositivity of\nantibodies against the capsid protein VP1 in the blood.18\nHowever, primary infection with MCPyV does not cause\nany discernible signs or symptoms. Despite the high prev-\nalence of MCPyV infection, very few people develop MCC.\nAn essential feature of MCPyV-associated MCC is that the\ntumour cells express speciﬁc products of the viral early\ngenes, i.e. small T antigen (ST) and a truncated version of\nlarge T antigen (LT). LT and ST have also been referred to as\nviral oncoproteins, and their capacity to interact with mul-\ntiple cellular proteins, thereby altering their function, has\nbeen demonstrated.19,20 While MCPyV-associated MCCs are\ncharacterised by very low frequencies of somatic mutations,\nvirus-negative MCCs are among the tumours with the\nhighest mutational load, typically displaying UV signa-\ntures.21 Among the aberrations found in MCPyV-negative\nMCC,\nmutations\ndisrupting\nthe\ngene\nencoding\nthe\nretinoblastoma-associated protein RB1 (the key protein\ncontrolling cell cycle entry) are almost always present.\nAnalogously, RB1 function in virus-associated MCC is\ninhibited by binding the LXCXE motif of LT to RB1; in either\ncase, cells are unable to arrest in the G1 phase of the cell\ncycle.21 Interestingly, MCPyV is not found in cases of MCC\nassociated with cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, indi-\ncating that it does not play a part in these combined\ntumours.22,23\nHistopathology\nHistopathological features of MCC are those of a small-blue-\nround-cell tumour with a vesicular nucleus and scant\ncytoplasm.24 However, several different histopathological\npatterns exist, including trabecular, intermediate and small-\ncell variants. Neoplastic cells can also be large and may\npresent with a pleomorphic morphology. The nucleoli are\nmultiple and usually not prominent. Mitotic and apoptotic\nrates are frequently high. The tumour regularly inﬁltrates\nthe reticular dermis and subcutis. The epidermis, papillary\ndermis and adnexal structures are usually spared, although\nepidermotropism is observed in up to 10% of cases. The\npresence of intra-lymphatic emboli and isolated tumour\ncells close to the surgical margins may explain the high rate\nof local recurrences.24,25 As the histomorphology of MCC on\nhaematoxylineeosin (H&E) sections is rather nonspeciﬁc,\nthe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires immunohisto-\nchemical staining to rule out other tumours that display a\nsmall-blue-round-cell morphology (e.g. basal-cell carci-\nnoma; metastatic small-cell carcinoma, particularly from the\nlung; cutaneous lymphoma; anaplastic sweat gland carci-\nnoma; melanoma; Ewing’s sarcoma; neuroblastoma and\nrhabdomyosarcoma).24\nMCC cells express several types of cytoskeletal keratins\n(CKs), particularly CK20 (membranous and/or paranuclear\ndot-like), CK8, CK18 and CK19. A small subset of MCCs\n(<10%) are negative for CK20; these cases are characterised\nby a high mutational burden and are generally not associ-\nated with MCPyV. In addition to CKs, neoplastic cells also\nexpress chromogranin A, synaptophysin, cluster of differ-\nentiation\n(CD)56,\nneuron-speciﬁc\nenolase\n(NSE)\nand\nhuntingtin-interacting protein 1. MCC is usually negative for\nthyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), leukocyte common\nantigen, melan A, mammalian achaete-scute homologue 1,\nvimentin, protein S100 and CK7.23,24,26 However, rare cases\nESMO Open\nI. Lugowska et al.\n2\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\n\n---\nof MCC can be positive for TTF1 or CK7, and so interpre-\ntation of the staining patterns of these two antigens should\nbe carried out with caution. These markers should be\nincluded in an immunopanel for MCC conﬁrmation and\nexclusion of other diagnostic considerations.\nNo histological marker has been reliably associated with\nthe selective identiﬁcation of either virus- or UV-associated\nMCC: while positive staining for MCPyV LT strongly suggests\nan MCPyV-associated MCC, negative staining does not\nnecessarily rule it out.27,28 Although all of these markers are\nhelpful and essential for diagnosis, particularly in the\npresence of artefacts, no convincing evidence supports their\nuse to predict prognosis or response to therapy. Concerning\nthe latter, variable numbers of tumour-inﬁltrating cytotoxic\nT lymphocytes (not identiﬁed, brisk, non-brisk) are found in\nMCC tumours, and their presence is associated with a\nbetter prognosis, which is particularly favourable if their T-\ncell receptor repertoire is characterised by clonal diversity.29\nThe deﬁnitive diagnosis of MCC requires histopatholog-\nical examination of tissue obtained by incisional/excisional\nbiopsy.4 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other tissues such\nas fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical margins;\ntumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratumoural\nlymphocyte\ninﬁltration;\nimmunohistochemical\nproﬁle;\nMCPyV status and mitotic rate.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The clinical examination must include a physical examina-\ntion with the assessment of locoregional LNs, comorbid\nconditions and patient life expectancy [III, A].\n\u0003 Histopathological MCC conﬁrmation should include H&E\nwith the dedicated immunopanel [III, A].\n\u0003 The histology report after excisional biopsy should\ninclude tumour size; the involvement of other structures\nsuch as fascia, muscle, cartilage or bones; surgical mar-\ngins; tumour depth; lymphovascular invasion; intratu-\nmoural lymphocyte inﬁltration; immunohistochemical\nproﬁle; MCPyV status and mitotic rate [III, A].\n\u0003 Dermatoscopymayenhancedifferentialdiagnosticaccuracy,\nespecially for patients with multiple skin lesions [IV, B].\nSTAGING AND RISK ASSESSMENT\nThe preferred classiﬁcation is the eighth version of the\nUnion\nfor\nInternational\nCancer\nControl\n(UICC)\nTNM\n(tumourenodeemetastasis) staging and classiﬁcation sys-\ntem, which provides information for both management and\nprognosis of patients with MCC (see Supplementary\nTables\nS1-S4,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.\nesmoop.2024.102977).30 This classiﬁcation was developed\nbased on data collected from 9387 patients with MCC in the\nNational Cancer Database. Staging and risk assessment\nprocedures are determined based on disease presentation\nat diagnosis.31\nThe initial evaluation in MCC should include a complete\nexamination of the skin with particular attention to any\nsuspicious cancerous skin lesions, tumour satellites, in-\ntransit metastases, regional LNs and systemic metastases.\nThe assessment of disease extension in all patients is\nmandatory: ultrasound of regional LNs for patients with\nclinical stage I-II disease and computed tomography (CT) of\nthe chest, abdomen and pelvis (and head/neck for head/\nneck primaries).32 Positron emission tomography (PET)eCT\nappears more sensitive than CT alone based on published\nmeta-analyses and other retrospective studies; it was\nshown that 16.8% of patients who underwent PETeCT had\ntheir disease upstaged compared with 6.9% of those who\nunderwent CT scans only.33,34 Therefore, if PET and/or PETe\nCT with [18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) are available,\nthey are the preferred cross-sectional imaging methods to\nassess local and distant disease.16 If additional clinical\nsymptoms are present, detailed imaging studies using\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be carried out.\nSentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) with an appropriate immuno-\npanel is considered the most reliable staging procedure for\nidentifying subclinical nodal involvement. As such, it is\nrecommended for all patients with clinically node-negative\ndisease who are ﬁt for radical therapy. SLNB should be\ncarried out alongside local surgical therapy of the primary\ntumour with special attention to drainage patterns. The\nobserved 17.1% false-negative SLNB results may occur in\nimmunocompromised patients or tumours localised in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region.35,36 SLNB enables the\ndetection of micrometastases in approximately one-third of\npatients with clinically node-negative MCC, and its positivity\nrate is w20% for T1 and 40%-50% for T2 MCCs.37-39 In\nchallenging locations for SLNB, single-photon emission\ncomputed tomographyeCT techniques should be utilised.40\nAccess to a full pathological report with the number of\ninvolved LNs, the size of metastatic deposits and the status\nof the extracapsular extension is crucial for staging, pre-\ndiction and decision making.41 Patients with clinically\napparent nodal disease at presentation with an unknown\nprimary should have a biopsy for histological conﬁrmation\nof MCC.12,42\nThe 5-year overall survival (OS) in all MCC patients is be-\ntween 48% and 63%: 64% in patients without metastases\n(stage I-II), 51% in those with regional LN involvement (stage\nIII), 68% in those with an unknown primary tumour and 17%-\n29% in patients with distant metastases (stage IV).39,43-45\nRetrospective data have shown that unfavourable clinical\nprognostic factors are the presence of regional and distant\nmetastases, primary tumour diameter >2 cm and/or its\nextension beyond the dermis, location in the head/neck\nregion, >75 years of age, male sex and presence of co-\nmorbidity, especially immunosuppression (e.g. HIV, chronic\nlymphocytic leukaemia).3,39,43,46 The poor prognosis has\nalso been linked to histopathological futures such as posi-\ntive margins after resection, a high mitotic rate, inﬁltrative\n(rather than circumscribed) growth pattern, lymphovascular\ninﬁltration and p63 expression, whereas LT and RB1 protein\nexpression and intratumoural CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltra-\ntion correlate with a more favourable prognosis.10,12,24\nHowever, there are no prospective data available in MCC.\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n3\n\n---\nProgrammed\ndeath-ligand\n1\n(PD-L1)\nexpression\nis\nfrequently detected in MCC tumour cells and the tumour\nmicroenvironment. Nevertheless, its expression does not\ncorrelate with prognosis.47-49 Serum markers such as anti-\nbodies against MCPyV or NSE require further prospective\nvalidation.50,51\nRecommendations\n\u0003 SLNB is indicated to improve prognostic staging, e.g. to\nrule out occult nodal disease, but the precision of\nSLNB is less reliable in immunocompromised patients\nand in patients whose tumours are located in the\nhead, neck or midline trunk region and with aberrant\nLN drainage [III, A].\n\u0003 Mandatory imaging studies comprise CT scans of the\nchest, abdomen, pelvis and head/neck (for head/neck\nprimaries). If available, whole-body FDGePET/CT is pref-\nerable over contrast-enhanced CT scan; MRI imaging of\nspeciﬁc organs should be carried out if clinically indi-\ncated [III, A].\n\u0003 The value of immunohistological markers, such as p63,\nPD-L1, NSE or CD200, is not fully established [IV, B].\nMANAGEMENT OF LOCAL/LOCOREGIONAL DISEASE\nThe mainstay of treatment for patients with localised MCC\nis wide local excision (WLE) followed by tumour bed\nradiotherapy (RT) and management of the nodal basin. A\nproposed algorithm for the management of locoregional\nMCC is shown in Figure 1.\nSince wide excision can potentially compromise lymphatic\ndrainage, an SLNB should be carried out simultaneously with\nsurgical treatment of the primary MCC. A precise surgical\ntechnique called Mohs surgery may be considered instead of\nWLE in selected cases based on results from meta-analyses of\npatients with stage I MCC, which showed similar recurrence\nrates for both surgical modalities: local recurrence rates were\n6.8% for WLE versus 8.5% for Mohs surgery, and regional\nrecurrence rates were similar at w15%, although no rando-\nmised trials comparing traditional WLE with Mohs surgery\nwere included in these meta-analyses.52\nAfter resection, there is a need to obtain a clear patho-\nlogical margin, although the size of surgical margin is under\ndebate.53 In one publication, a margin >2 cm was associ-\nated with a signiﬁcant improvement in OS54; however, other\ndata have not supported a correlation between margin size\nbeyond 1 cm and additional clinical beneﬁt. In a study of\n6156 patients with localised MCC, resection margins >1 cm\nwere associated with improvements in OS compared with\nmargins of <1 cm; 5-year survival rates were 90% and 77%\n(P < 0.001), respectively.55\nAccording\nto\nﬁndings\nfrom\na\nretrospective\nstudy\ncomprising a cohort of patients who had clear margins\nfollowing resection and received post-operative RT, surgical\nexcision with margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus >1.0 cm was not\nassociated with any signiﬁcant difference in terms of OS,\nany recurrence-free survival (RFS) or local RFS.56 Thus,\nsurgical margins might be reduced to avoid reconstruction,\nespecially for preserving cosmetics (face) or function (lo-\ncations close to joints). Findings from this retrospective\nstudy also showed that excision, even with narrow margins\n(0.5-1.0 cm), was not associated with outcome. Cancer-\nspeciﬁc survival was 76.8% versus 76.2% for patients with\nresection margins of 0.5-1.0 cm versus 1-2 cm, respectively.\nHowever, for patients with narrow resection margins, post-\noperative RT to the tumour bed is mandatory.56 In sum-\nmary, there is a need to obtain surgical margins of 1-2 cm\nand histologically negative margins, if feasible, which must\nbe followed by adjuvant RT regardless of the type of sur-\ngery.15,57-59\nThe beneﬁt of adjuvant RT following excision of the pri-\nmary tumour was shown in a systematic review and meta-\nanalysis considering >17 000 patients with stages I-III MCC\nfrom 29 observational studies.60 A favourable OS beneﬁt\nwas associated with surgery plus adjuvant RT versus surgery\nalone [hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)\n0.75-0.86, P < 0.001]. The study also reported a signiﬁcant\nbeneﬁt in locoregional and local disease-free survival (DFS),\nbut not distant DFS (HR 0.3, 95% CI 0.22-0.42; HR 0.21, 95%\nCI 0.14-0.33 and HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.49-1.14, respectively).60\nThe largest series to date to assess whether adjuvant\ntherapy was associated with better survival included 6908\ncases from the National Cancer Database.61 It showed that\nfor localised MCC, surgery and adjuvant RT was associated\nwith a statistically signiﬁcant improvement in OS compared\nwith surgery alone (stage I: HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.80; stage\nII: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89), but in patients with regional\nnodal metastases (stage III), neither the addition of adju-\nvant RT nor chemotherapy (ChT) had a signiﬁcant impact on\nOS. These ﬁndings suggest that the addition of RT may\nbeneﬁt the local control of localised disease; however, it is\nreasonable to believe that survival in patients with more\nadvanced disease may be driven by the presence of sub-\nclinical distant metastasis.61\nIt is worth noting that the MCC patient population con-\ntains elderly patients, which frequently causes clinicians to\ndeviate from standard treatment protocols. This was\nrecently\nillustrated\nin\na\nstudy\nthat\ninvestigated\nthe\nconcordance to adjuvant treatment guidelines in patients\nwith stage I-II MCC.62 Of the 2330 patients in this study,\n1858 had an indication for adjuvant RT [according to Na-\ntional Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines\ncriteria63] but only 57% of these patients received RT; those\nwho received RT had a 5-year OS advantage over those who\ndid not (76% versus 68%, P < 0.0003). Conversely, of the\n472 patients without an indication for adjuvant RT (ac-\ncording to NCCN criteria), 43% received RT; this group did\nnot show an OS beneﬁt over those who did not receive RT\n(79% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.48).62\nThe optimal adjuvant RT dose is unclear.64 In a retro-\nspective study of 2093 patients who underwent surgery\nfollowed by adjuvant RT, four groups of patients receiving\ndifferent doses of RT (30-40 Gy, 40-50 Gy, 50-55 Gy and 55-\n70 Gy) were analysed; the 3-year OS rates were 41.8%,\n69.0%, 69.2% and 66.0%, respectively.65 An Australian study\nESMO Open\nI. Lugowska et al.\n4\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\n\n---\ndocumenting a dose response showed that no patients with\nmacroscopic MCC developed in-ﬁeld relapses at doses\n>56 Gy.66 Furthermore, in a large population-based study\nof patients with head and neck-located MCC (N ¼ 1625)\nundergoing adjuvant RT (85% with negative margins and\n15% with residual MCC), a dose range of 50-55 Gy conferred\na survival advantage compared with doses <50 Gy. There\nwas no signiﬁcant improvement by escalating doses beyond\nthis range, which could reﬂect toxicity-related morbidity or\ndeath from competing risks in this mostly older patient\ncohort.65 Therefore, a radiation dose of 50-60 Gy is often\nrecommended in MCC, achieving in-ﬁeld control.\nIn some patients, surgical therapy is not feasible due to\nthe extent of disease (technically inoperable) or the pres-\nence of signiﬁcant (co)morbidity. Since MCC is radiosensi-\ntive, RT as a single modality is an alternative to surgery in\nthis group. The natural history of patients treated with\ndeﬁnitive RT is out-of-ﬁeld relapse with in-ﬁeld control\nachieved in most patients.38 In a systematic review, an\nalmost 90% in-ﬁeld control rate was documented following\ndeﬁnitive RT with a mean dose delivered of just under\n50 Gy.38 Recurrences occurred at 39/332 sites (13 local\nrelapses, 26 regional) for a cumulative post-RT in-ﬁeld\nrecurrence rate of 11.7%. Of note, there was no association\nbetween RT dose and incidence of recurrence or non-\nrecurrence. RT of the primary tumour can also be curative\nwhen excision is not possible due to severe comorbidity\ndisqualifying the patient from surgery or in individuals who\nrefuse surgical treatment.67 However, there is also a lack\nof consensus regarding the optimal dose/fractionation\nschedule. Independently, the European Consensus-based\ninterdisciplinary guideline and NCCN guidelines propose\ndoses of 60-66 Gy for deﬁnitive treatment of patients with\ngrossly positive primary tumour resection margins and/or\nclinically evident lymphadenopathy.15,63\nManagement of early-stage MCC (stage I-II)\nIn the early stages of MCC (stage I-II), the standard treat-\nment approach is WLE of the primary tumour.15,68 In T1-4\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage I-III)\nPrimary tumour management\nLN management\nSLN\npositive\nSLN\nnegative\nClinically negative LNs\nClinically positive LNs and in CUP\nNodal dissection and/or RT [III, B]\nAdjuvant RT ± nodal\ndissection [III, B]\nClinical trials with\n(neo)adjuvant systemic\ntherapy [III,A]\nClinical trials with (neo)adjuvant\nsystemic therapy [III,A]\nSLNB with immunopanel [III,A]\nOperable:\nWLE ± RT [IV, B]\nObservation\nDeﬁnitive RT [III, B]\nInoperable:\ndeﬁnitive RT [V, B]\nor\nanti-PD-1 therapya [III,A]\nRT (high risk of false-negative\nSLNB)b [IV, B]\nFigure 1.

In a review of\n29 studies that included patients with stage I-II MCC, no\nsigniﬁcant difference in regional recurrence rate was\ndemonstrated with versus without adjuvant RT (14.3%\nversus 4.6%, P ¼ 0.31).38 Furthermore, similar regional\nnodal recurrence and OS rates were reported in a cohort\nof 240 patients who underwent SLNB or elective LN\ndissection\nwithout\nprior\npathological\nnodal\nstaging\n(P ¼ 0.056).69 However, in selected clinical situations,\nthere is value in adjuvant regional RT. It is recommended\nin patients with profound immunosuppression, if SLNB is\nnot carried out or its accuracy is questionable [i.e.\nanatomic compromise, aberrant LN drainage or the pres-\nence of multiple sentinel LN (SLN) basins which is typical\nin head, neck or midline trunk MCC].70\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III)\nPatients with stage III MCC have a competing risk of sys-\ntemic recurrence. On the other hand, in elderly patients,\nsevere comorbidity may lead to increased risk for intra-/\npost-operative complications and higher morbidity related\nto local therapy. Each decision on adjuvant therapy should\nideally be made within the conﬁnes of an MDT. In this sit-\nuation, there is a recommendation to include patients in\nclinical trials for neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy when\navailable.\nIn the presence of microscopic metastasis detected on\nSLNB or during node dissection [pathological stage IIIA: T1-\n4, N1a, N1a(sn), M0], adjuvant RT alone or in combination\nwith complete LN dissection (CLND) may be considered and\nrequires an individualised approach. In a prospective study,\n163 patients with SLN metastasis only underwent CLND or\nRT, and there were no signiﬁcant differences in survival\noutcomes (5-year OS: 71% versus 64%, P ¼ 1.0; DFS: 52%\nversus 61%, P ¼ 0.8; nodal RFS: 76% versus 91%, P ¼ 0.3 or\ndistant relapse-free survival: 65% versus 75%, P ¼ 0.3,\nrespectively). With sufﬁcient in-ﬁeld control of macroscopic\nMCC, in selected fragile patients who cannot tolerate nodal\nexcision under local anaesthesia, RT as monotherapy should\nbe considered.71 Another retrospective study of 447 pa-\ntients with MCC and a positive SLNB collected in the Na-\ntional Cancer Database showed that adjuvant RT \u0004 CLND\nled to a survival beneﬁt compared with CLND alone or\nobservation.72 Therefore, in younger patients (<75 years of\nage) with fewer comorbidities, a multidisciplinary approach\nwith adjuvant RT and CLND may be beneﬁcial. However, the\npotential beneﬁt may be decreased by the potential com-\nplications of CLND, such as lymphoedema, post-operative\nwound infection, skin necrosis and wound dehiscence,\nwhich is higher in the inguinal basin than in axillary\ndissection (26% versus 9%, respectively).73\nNo randomised trials have evaluated the efﬁcacy of\nadjuvant ChT or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with\nMCC. Therefore, adjuvant ChT is not routinely indicated. The\ndata supporting CRT are derived from a retrospective study\nof 4815 patients with head and neck MCC.74 In male pa-\ntients with positive margins and a tumour size of >3 cm,\npost-operative CRT and RT both provided a survival beneﬁt\ncompared with surgery alone (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81;\nHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.92, respectively).74 In a study of\n6908 patients in the National Cancer Database, there was\nno beneﬁt (or detriment) of giving adjuvant ChT to patients\nwith high-risk disease.61 In this fragile population, the risk of\nserious side-effects is signiﬁcantly higher due to existing\ncomorbidities, and ChT-related mortality is between 4% and\n8%. There is also a concern about the immunosuppressive\neffects of ChT, which may lead to the development and\nprogression of MCC.75-77\nA limited number of published case reports and series\nhave addressed MCC of unknown primary (pathological\nstage IIIA: T0, N1b, M0). This group has a better outcome\nthan patients with known primary and synchronous nodal\nmetastases.12,42 The recommendation in this group is to\ncarry out a biopsy for pathological conﬁrmation of MCC,\nFDGePETeCT to rule out distant metastatic disease and\nmanagement of the nodal lesions similar to that proposed\nfor stage IIIB MCC.\nFor patients with clinically positive nodal disease (path-\nological stage IIIB, T1-4, N1b-3, M0), cross-sectional imaging\nis advised before surgery. There have been no prospective\ntrials evaluating the appropriate extent of CLND clearance\nfor MCC; in the absence of such evidence, it is recom-\nmended to follow the ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline\n(CPG) for cutaneous melanoma.78 An analysis of the SEER\ndatabase incorporated propensity scoring and matched-pair\nanalysis and reported no difference in MCC-speciﬁc survival\nin patients who received RT after CLND versus observa-\ntion.79,80 In another study, Lewis et al. carried out a data-\nbase analysis encompassing 1254 patients and found\nreductions in local and regional recurrences with similar\nrates of distant metastases, but no statistical difference in\nterms of OS and MCC-speciﬁc survival.81 Therefore, patients\nwith node-positive MCC should be considered for clinical\ntrials with (neo)adjuvant systemic therapy because neither\nadjuvant RT nor ChT has been associated with a statistically\nsigniﬁcant impact on OS.61\nSatellite or in-transit metastases (pathological stage IIIB,\nT1-4, N2-3, M0) at post-operative histology are caused by\nthe cutaneous or subcutaneous intra-lymphatic spread. The\nfrequency is unclear but it is always associated with poor\nsurvival.42,82,83 In bulky, multiple and/or frequently recur-\nrent locoregional metastases, isolated limb perfusion may\nESMO Open\nI.

In a phase I-II study (CheckMate 358) of\nnivolumab in the neoadjuvant setting, surgical resection\nwas conducted after two doses of nivolumab 240 mg given\n2 weeks apart.85 Among the 36 patients who underwent\nsurgery, 17 had a conﬁrmed pathological CR (pCR) and 18\nhad a partial response (PR) by radiological assessment. At a\nmedian follow-up of 20 months, no patient with a pCR\nexperienced disease relapse. Additional studies are required\nto conﬁrm the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy and the\nextent of surgery or post-operative RT in patients with a\npCR.85 In the adjuvant setting, although initial reports failed\nto show a therapeutic beneﬁt with ipilimumab as adjuvant\nmonotherapy, interim results from a prospective rando-\nmised study suggest a beneﬁt in terms of DFS for the pro-\ngrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, nivolumab.\nHowever, ﬁnal results from prospective randomised trials\nare required to determine the true beneﬁts of adjuvant PD-\n(L)1 blockade.86\nRecommendations\n\u0003 An MDT meeting comprising experts with signiﬁcant\nMCC experience should be convened to diagnose and\nmake decisions about therapy; the preferred option is\nparticipation in clinical trials [III, A].\nManagement of local/locoregional disease (stage I-III)\n\u0003 After excisional biopsy, WLE with a margin of 1-2 cm\nis considered adequate; if a resection margin of\n1-2 cm is not technically achievable, a narrower\nmargin (0.5-1.0 cm) with adjuvant RT may also be\nacceptable [IV, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant RT with 50-60 Gy to the tumour bed is recom-\nmended for tumours of \u00051 cm in diameter and/or with\nnegative prognostic features (stage \u0005IB) [IV, A].\n\u0003 In patients at very low risk of locoregional recurrence\n(stage IA), clinical observation may be an alternative\nbut such a decision should only be made at referral cen-\ntres [V, A].\n\u0003 When WLE is not feasible, deﬁnitive RT of the primary\ntumour is an alternative approach [V, B].\nManagement of early-stage MCC (stage I-II; T1-4 N0 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 SLNB should be carried out during local surgical therapy\nof the primary tumour with special attention to drainage\npatterns [III, A].\n\u0003 In patients with a negative SLNB, observation is an op-\ntion, but in case of a risk of false negativity of SLNB or\nwhen SLNB is not carried out, adjuvant RT to the primary\nsite and nodal basin may be considered. This decision\nmust only be made at referral centres [IV, B].\nManagement of locoregional MCC (stage III; T1-4 N1-3 M0\ndisease)\n\u0003 After a positive SLNB, adjuvant RT alone or in combina-\ntion with CLND is recommended after an MDT discussion\n[IV, B].\n\u0003 In clinically positive LNs, multiple nodal involvements or\nextra-nodal extension of the SLN, regional LN dissection\nwith post-operative RT is recommended (or deﬁnitive RT\nin inoperable patients) [III, B].\n\u0003 Adjuvant ChT is not recommended [IV, D]; patients should\nbe considered for clinical trials with (neo)adjuvant sys-\ntemic therapy of modern immunotherapies [III, A].\nMANAGEMENT OF ADVANCED/METASTATIC DISEASE\nDespite the recent advances in diagnosis and treatment,\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC remain incurable. Admin-\nistration of immunotherapy in the ﬁrst-/second-line settings\nis recommended (if there is no contraindication for immu-\nnotherapy).87,88 ChT, palliative RT, best supportive care or\nparticipation in clinical trials should be considered based on\nthe clinical situation. In patients with recurrent oligometa-\nstatic and resectable disease, surgical removal or stereo-\ntactic irradiation of metastases can be considered if\nsystemic immunotherapy is contraindicated or the disease\nis refractory. A proposed algorithm for the management of\ninoperable stage III and IV MCC is shown in Figure 2.\nImmunotherapy\nPD-(L)1 checkpoint inhibitors are effective in the treatment\nof metastatic MCC.89 These drugs allow the reactivation of T\nlymphocytes and the triggering of the adaptive immune\nsystem by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 of the\ntumour\nmicroenvironment\nand\nPD-1\nexpressed\non\nlymphocyte surfaces. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 restores the\nantitumour activity of effector T cells and the function of\nexhausted T cells.89\nDespite their proven efﬁcacy, resistance to immune\ncheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can occur due to different\nmechanisms: intrinsic resistance in patients who do not\nrespond to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or acquired resistance in\npatients\nwhose\ntumours\nprogress\nafter\nthe\ninitial\nresponse.90-92 Open questions regarding the immunogenic\ncharacteristics\nof\nboth\nMCPyV-positive\nand\n-negative\nMerkel-cell tumours and the lack of predictive biomarkers\nof response to treatment are still under evaluation. Clinical\nbeneﬁt was not associated with any other biomarker eval-\nuated to date, such as PD-L1, MCPyV status, tumour\nmutational burden or CD8þ T-lymphocyte inﬁltration.90-92\nImmunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab [ESMO-\nMagnitude of Clinical Beneﬁt Scale (ESMO-MCBS) v1.1\nscore: 4; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Euro-\npean Medicines Agency (EMA) approved], pembrolizumab\n[ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA approved, not EMA\napproved], retifanlimab (FDA and approved) and nivolu-\nmab (not EMA or FDA approved), have shown high\nresponse rates both as ﬁrst- and second-line treatments,\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n7\n\n---\nwith long response durations and greater long-term ben-\neﬁts, when indirectly compared with ChT. Therefore,\nimmunotherapy is recommended in this setting if no\ncontraindications exist.\nThe ideal duration of ICI therapy is currently unknown.\nOne retrospective analysis of data collected at a single\ninstitute showed that among 65 patients treated with\navelumab, 25 had an FDGePETeCT-conﬁrmed CR. The 12-\nmonth RFS rate in these patients was 88% (95% CI 0.74-\n1.0). Reasons for stopping treatment included completion\nof 1 year of treatment (13 patients), toxicity (5 patients) and\npatient preference (7 patients).93 Prospective data from\nlarger patient cohorts and with longer follow-up are\ntherefore required to conﬁrm the ideal duration of ICI\ntherapy in patients with MCC.\nAvelumab. The efﬁcacy and safety of avelumab, an anti-PD-\nL1 inhibitor, were analysed in the JAVELIN Merkel 200 study,\nwhich was divided into parts A and B.94,95 Part A included\n88 patients with metastatic MCC who progressed after at\nleast one line of ChT. After >2 years of follow-up, the\nobjective response rate (ORR) was 33.0% (11.4% CR), me-\ndian duration of response (DoR) was 40.5 months and the\nDoR was >2 years in 67.0% of responders.90,94,95 In part B,\npatients who had not received prior systemic treatment for\nmetastatic disease were enrolled; the ORR was 39.7%\n(16.4% CR) with 30.2% having a response lasting >6\nmonths; the median OS was 20.3 months. First-line avelu-\nmab treatment was generally well-tolerated, and no\ntreatment-related deaths or grade 4 adverse events (AEs)\noccurred.\nIn\nthe\npretreated\npopulation,\ngrade\n3-4\ntreatment-related AEs (TRAEs) were observed in 11.4% of\npatients. From December 2015 to March 2019, 494 patients\nreceived avelumab as a ﬁrst- or second-line treatment for\nMCC within an expanded access programme (EAP); the ORR\nwas 46.7% (22.9% CR) and the disease control rate was\n71.2%. Avelumab was also associated with long-lasting\ndisease\ncontrol\nand\na\npositive\neffect\non\nOS.90,94,95\nEmerging real-world data suggest that outcomes with ave-\nlumab in clinical practice are in line with those seen in\nclinical trials.96 Recently published global data from EAPs\nand retrospective studies reported ORRs ranging from\n29.1% to 72.1% [CR 15.8%-37.2%; PR 18.2%-42.1% and\nstable disease (SD) 7.1%-30.9%], with median progression-\nfree survival (PFS) ranging from 8.1 to 24.1 months.\nImportantly, immunosuppressed patients also beneﬁted\nfrom avelumab, with response rates equivalent to the\ngeneral population. The best outcomes were achieved when\navelumab was given as ﬁrst-line therapy. The most common\nAEs were fatigue and infusion-related reactions; autoim-\nmune hepatitis and thyroiditis were also observed.97\nPembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab, a humanised immuno-\nglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that selectively\nbinds PD-1 on the surface of T lymphocytes, has been\ntested as a ﬁrst-line treatment in patients with MCC.98,99 In\na phase II clinical trial (KEYNOTE-017), 50 patients received\npembrolizumab for up to 2 years. TRAEs of any grade\noccurred in 49 of 50 patients (98%) and 15 patients (30%)\nhad grade \u00053 TRAEs with one death due to pericardial and\npleural effusion. The ORR was 58%, with 30% of patients\nachieving a CR. At 3 years, the PFS was 39.1% with a median\nPFS of 16.8 months; the 3-year OS rate was 59.4%, with a\nmedian OS not reached.99 Age, gender, baseline tumour\nburden, anatomic sites of metastasis and tumour PD-L1\nexpression and viral status expression did not correlate\nwith ORR, PFS or OS.98,99\nNivolumab. Nivolumab, a fully human anti-PD-1 IgG4\nmonoclonal antibody, was evaluated in two prospective\nstudies in combination with ipilimumab. A randomised,\nopen-label, phase II trial showed that in 50 patients\n[including 26 who had received prior anti-PD-(L)1 therapy],\nnivolumabeipilimumab [with half of the patients also\nreceiving stereotactic body RT (SBRT) (24 Gy in three frac-\ntions)] was associated with a high response rate and an\nManagement of inoperable/metastatic MCC (stage III-IV)\nAssessment of PS and comorbidities\nFirst line: \nPreferred: clinical trial [III, B]\nAlternative: immunotherapy (avelumaba [III, A; MCBS 4]b, \npembrolizumabc [III, A; MCBS 3]b, retifanlimaba [III, A] or \nnivolumabd [III, A]) + BSC\nSecond line: \nPreferred: clinical trial [III, B] \nAlternative: palliative RT and/or ChT + BSC [III, B]\nThird line: \nPreferred: clinical trial [III, B]\nAlternative: BSC\nFigure 2.

Although the effectiveness of\nnivolumabeipilimumab looks promising, data are immature\nand limited to a small sample size. It is also important to\nconsider the signiﬁcant risk of severe AEs in the elderly MCC\npopulation. Findings from the phase I/II CheckMate 358\ntrial also suggest that nivolumab is active as monotherapy\nin patients with advanced MCC. Among 25 treated patients\n(22 assessable), the ORR was 68% and the 3-month PFS and\nOS rates were 82% and 92%, respectively.77\nRetifanlimab. Retifanlimab is a humanised, hinge-stabilised\nIgG4k, anti-PD-1 antibody that is EMA and FDA approved\nfor the treatment of metastatic or recurrent locally\nadvanced MCC not amenable to curative surgery or RT\nbased on data from the phase II POD1UM-201 trial. In this\ntrial, retifanlimab treatment resulted in an ORR of 52% (95%\nCI 40% to 65%) in ChT-naive patients (N ¼ 65; CR 18% and\nPR 34%) with a median DoR between 1.1 months and >24.9\nmonths. Twenty-two\npercent\nof\npatients\nexperienced\nserious TRAEs, including fatigue, arrhythmia and pneumo-\nnitis, and 11% discontinued therapy due to AEs (the most\ncommon AEs were fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, pruritus,\ndiarrhoea, rash, pyrexia and nausea).101\nChT\nAs there are no randomised trials in patients with MCC and\ndistant metastases, the impact of systemic ChT on survival is\nunclear. To date, available data are insufﬁcient to determine\nwhich of the different ChT regimens ensures the best PFS\nand OS in patients with metastatic MCC.\nChT regimens that have been used to treat patients with\nMCC include taxanes, topotecan, a combination of etopo-\nsideecisplatin, etoposideecarboplatin or cyclophosphamidee\ndoxorubicinevincristine.102 Response rates ranged from 20%\nto 75%, with higher response rates in the ﬁrst-line setting\n(53%-61%) versus the second-line setting (23%-45%); among\nresponders, the median DoRs were w2-9 months.76,103,104\nUnfortunately, in this fragile, elderly population, the occur-\nrence of toxic deaths limits ChT usage; toxic deaths were\nobserved in 3%-10% of patients.76,103,104 However, ChT might\nbe proposed after failure on immunotherapy or when\nimmunotherapy is contraindicated.\nTargeted therapies\nIn the UKMCC-01 trial, the efﬁcacy of pazopanib was\nassessed in 16 patients with MCC and a median age of 73\nyears (range 56-90 years).105 A clinical beneﬁt was reported\nin nine patients (three had a PR and six had SD) with a\nmedian duration of 8.0 weeks (range 1.3-38.4 weeks). The\ntrial was stopped due to slow accrual.105 A lack of activity\nand limited tolerance were also shown in a phase II trial\nwith cabozantinib in patients with recurrent/metastatic\nMCC after platinum failure.106 Based on published results,\nthe use of targeted therapy is not recommended.\nWith regard to radioligand therapy, although MCC\nfrequently\nexpresses\nsomatostatin\nreceptors,\nGa68-\nDOTATOC and Lu177-DOTATATE have only been studied\nin a few patients and further clinical trials are needed to\ndetermine their role in MCC.102,107 As such, they should not\ncurrently be considered as a standard of care.\nPalliative RT\nPalliative RT has mainly been assessed retrospectively. In a\nstudy applying an 8-Gy single fraction, a CR with almost 80%\nof in-ﬁeld lesion control was documented in 45% of pa-\ntients.87 Another study comparing 8 Gy as a single or\nmultiple fractions (3 \u0006 8 Gy) documented a CR in 10%\nversus 48% and a recurrence rate of 41% versus 5% (P ¼\n0.04), respectively.108 Patients of poor performance status\nshould be considered for a lower dose hypofractionation\nschedule (e.g. 20 Gy in 5 fractions or 30 Gy in 10 fractions),\nwhich can still achieve tumour regression.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Patients should receive individualised multimodality\ntreatment in referral centres for rare skin cancers with\naccess to clinical trials [III, B].\n\u0003 In oligometastatic disease progression, surgical removal\nor stereotactic irradiation of operable locoregional recur-\nrence or a single distant metastasis should be considered\nin ﬁt patients, although systemic immunotherapy should\nbe considered as the ﬁrst step [V, B].\n\u0003 Immunotherapeutic agents, such as avelumab (III, A;\nESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 4; FDA and EMA approved),\npembrolizumab (III, A; ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score: 3; FDA\napproved, not EMA approved), retifanlimab (III, A; FDA\nand EMA approved) and nivolumab (III, A; not EMA or\nFDA approved), are recommended as ﬁrst- and second-\nline treatments if no contraindications exist.\n\u0003 In cases of inoperable/disseminated disease, ﬁrst-line\ntreatment with an anti-PD-(L)1 antibody is suggested\nas it is more effective and safer than ChT [II, B].\n\u0003 In patients with contraindications or after failure of\nimmunotherapy, palliative RT and/or ChT may be op-\ntions, but their impact on OS is uncertain [III, B].\nPOPULATIONS OF SPECIAL CONSIDERATION\nSince MCC is present mainly in elderly patients, use of\ngeriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity assessments\nare important for decision making to achieve disease con-\ntrol and assure an acceptable quality of life. For patients\nwho are not medical candidates for surgery, RT alone may\nbe considered. However, in patients with inoperable/met-\nastatic disease, given the relatively good tolerability of ICIs,\nthese agents are the preferred choice of systemic therapy\nfor this subset of patients.\nI. Lugowska et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 5\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.102977\n9\n\n---\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Use of geriatric scales and concomitant comorbidity as-\nsessments are important for decision making [V, A].\n\u0003 RT alone may be considered in patients not suitable for\nsurgery [IV, A].\n\u0003 In elderly patients with inoperable/metastatic disease,\nICIs are the preferred choice of systemic therapy [IV, A].\nFOLLOW-UP, LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS AND\nSURVIVORSHIP\nAfter primary surgical excision, local recurrence develops in\n27%-60% of patients, regional nodal involvement is reported\nin 45%-91% of patients and distant metastases are found in\n18%-52%.42,109,110 Risk factors for recurrence include immu-\nnosuppression, advancing age, advancing stage of disease\n(stage II-IV), individuals assigned male at birth, non-SLN\nmetastases, MCPyV-negative status, as well as additional\nfactors as determined by the treating physicians. No formal\nclinical\ntrials\nhave\nevaluated\nthe\noptimal\nsurveillance\nschedule in MCC, either in terms of frequency or type of\ndiagnostic examinations. As the risk of relapse is higher in the\nﬁrst 2-3 years after initial treatment (40%-50% nodal and 33%\ndistant metastases),15 more intense follow-up should be\napplied in this period. Follow-up examinations are recom-\nmended every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, and then\nevery 6 months until year 5. After 5 years of observation, a\ngeneral physical examination is recommended every 12\nmonths lifelong, including a complete skin check-up. Physical\nexamination should include total-body skin examination and\nLN assessment with particular attention to the scar region,\nincluding the primary site, in-transit region and regional LN\nbasin. Distant metastases may develop in a wide range of\nanatomical locations; thus, routine cross-sectional imaging\nmay be proposed in higher-risk patients.\nThe radiological examination may be either a diagnostic CT\nof the thorax/abdomen/pelvis (and head/neck for patients\nwith head and neck primaries) or whole-body PETeCT, un-\ndertaken every 6-12 months for the ﬁrst 3 years, with ul-\ntrasound scans used for local LN assessment. After year 3,\nimaging studies should be carried out as clinically indicated.\nPatients with MCC have a higher risk for developing another\nskin cancer9,15,39,111,112; therefore, education regarding self-\nexamination of the whole skin surface is valuable. The role\nof MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncertain but it\nmay be utilised in patients who are seropositive at base-\nline.50,113,114 The early detection of a locoregional relapse\nmay be cured by surgery. However, inoperable/metastatic\nrelapse should be treated as metastatic disease, as described\nin the previous section.115-117 Therapy should be coordinated\nby an MDT at the referral centre.87,118,119\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Follow-up examinations are recommended in radically\ntreated patients every 3-6 months for the ﬁrst 3 years,\nand then every 6 months up to year 5. After 5 years of\nobservation,\na\ngeneral\nphysical\nexamination\nis\nrecommended every 12 months lifelong, including a\ncomplete skin check-up [IV, A].\n\u0003 Patient education regarding self-examination of the\nwhole skin is valuable as patients with MCC have a\nhigher risk of developing another skin cancer [IV, A].\n\u0003 The role of MCPyV oncoprotein antibody testing is uncer-\ntain, but it may be utilised in patients who are seropos-\nitive at baseline [V, A].\n\u0003 Routine cross-sectional imaging may be proposed in\nhigher-risk patients [IV, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG has been developed by ESMO in partnership with\nEURACAN, in accordance with the ESMO standard operating\nprocedures for CPG development (http://www.esmo.org/\nGuidelines/ESMO-GuidelinesMethodology).\nThe\nrelevant\nliterature has been selected by the expert authors. The\nguideline is conceived to provide a standard approach to\ndiagnosis, treatment and survivorship of MCC. Due to the\nrarity of MCC incidence, prospective and randomised\nstudies are limited; therefore, the basis of this guideline was\nmainly\ndata\nfrom\nretrospective,\nobservational\ncohort\nstudies, both institutional and cancer registry-based, often\nwith heterogeneous results. These studies have many limi-\ntations, such as selection bias, confounding factors, limited\nand missing data and lack of randomisation. Recommended\ninterventions are intended to correspond to the ‘standard’\napproaches according to current consensus among the Eu-\nropean multidisciplinary MCC community of experts. These\nare represented by the members of the ESMO Melanoma\nFaculty and experts appointed by all institutions belonging\nto the Rare Skin Cancer domain of EURACAN. Experimental\ninterventions considered to be beneﬁcial are labelled as\n‘investigational’. Other non-standard approaches may be\nproposed to the single patient as ‘options’ for a shared\npatientephysician decision in conditions of uncertainty as\nlong as some supporting evidence (though not conclusive) is\navailable.

The objective of the initial diagnostic\nwork-up of UKP-NENs is to identify the occult primary\ntumour. Metastatic patterns can be indicative of primary\ntumour location. The most common site for the occult pri-\nmary is the ileum followed by the pancreas.16 Ileal NETs\noften present as a mesenteric mass on computed tomog-\nraphy (CT).16 Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging (SRI)\nwith\ngallium-68-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-\ntetraacetic acid-labelled somatostatin analogue ([68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSA)epositron emission tomography (PET)eCT is the\nmost sensitive technique for NETs, detecting an occult pri-\nmary in 61% of cases.17 If SRI is uninformative, [18F]\nF-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)ePETeCT and endoscopy\ntechniques can be useful (see Supplementary Table S1,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664, and Section 3 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664).\nFor\nNECs,\n[18F]2-ﬂuoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose\n(FDG)ePETeCT may be used. The presence of secretory\nsyndromes and elevated hormone levels may also facilitate\nidentiﬁcation of the primary NET. A minimum panel of\npeptide\nhormones\nshould\nbe\nmeasured\nin\npatients\nwith\nUKP-NETs\n[calcitonin,\nmetanephrines\nand\n5-\nhydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)]. Other hormones may\nbe measured depending on symptoms (see Supplementary\nTable S1, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664,\nand\nSection\n3\nof\nthe\nSupplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664). Chromogranin A has demonstrated a sensi-\ntivity of 71% and speciﬁcity of 84%-85% for the detection of\ngastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NETs.18\nIt is important to distinguish between primary GUGy-\nNETs and metastasis in the GUGy system from primary tu-\nmours in another site. Indeed, ovarian, testicular and renal\nmetastases occur in patients with GEP or lung NETs.\nSymptoms result from local inﬁltration in patients with\nmore aggressive GUGy-NENs and performance status (PS)\ndeterioration. Less than 15% of GUGy-NETs present with\nhormone-related symptoms (mostly carcinoid syndrome).1\nHN-NENs induce non-speciﬁc symptoms such as hoarse-\nness, dysphagia, dyspnoea, nasal obstruction, epistaxis and\nconductive hearing loss.19,20 Laryngeal NENs arise from the\nsupraglottic region in 85% of cases.8 Middle-ear NENs appear\nas a retrotympanic mass extending into the ossicles, mastoid,\nauditory canal and Eustachian tube.9,19 Sinonasal NENs occur\nin the ethmoid (64% of cases), nasal cavity (32%) and maxil-\nlary sinus (14%). The most common metastatic sites are the\nlymph nodes, lungs, liver and bones.21 Skin metastases can be\nextremely painful and suggestive of laryngeal NETs.22 Func-\ntional syndromes are rare and include carcinoid syndrome,\nsyndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hor-\nmone, ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome and\nLamberteEaton myasthenic syndrome.23\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients\nwith UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs should be discussed in a\nNEN multidisciplinary tumour board (MTB) [V, A].\n\u0003 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs should be classiﬁed and\ngraded according to the common IARCeWHO 2018\nconsensus classiﬁcation together with the organ-speciﬁc\nWHO classiﬁcation [V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, IHC should be carried out to exclude para-\ngangliomas (cytokeratin) and to identify the primary [as a\nminimum: thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and\ncaudal-type homeobox 2 (CDX-2)]. Calcitonin, serotonin\nand other IHC markers may be used [IV, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, secretory syn-\ndromes should be diagnosed based on hormone-related\nsymptoms. As a minimum, metanephrines, 5-HIAA and\ncalcitonin should be measured in those with UKP-NETs\n[V, A].\n\u0003 For UKP-NETs, cross-sectional imaging may identify meta-\nstatic patterns suggestive of a primary site (e.g. a mesen-\nteric mass indicative of an ileal NET) [IV, A].

FDGePETeCT may be helpful\nin NENs with a higher proliferation index (G3 NETs\nand NECs) [V, B]. [18F]F-DOPAePETeCT may also detect\nan ileum primary, pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma\nin patients with UKP-NETs [V, B].\n\u0003 In patients with UKP-NECs, searches for the primary\nshould not delay treatment intervention, apart from cuta-\nneous examination for Merkel-cell carcinoma and IHC for\ncytokeratin 20 and Merkel-cell polyomavirus, if available\n[V, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nAdequate staging of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs relies on\ncross-sectional imaging and nuclear medicine techniques.\nCT scans are effective for the detection of lung metastases\nwhereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is better for\nliver and bone metastases. MRI is also preferred in young\npatients as radiation exposure is lower. SRI has a high\nsensitivity for NETs and should be part of the initial work-\nup. SSTR scintigraphy is less sensitive and should only be\ncarried out when SRIePETeCT is not available. Whole body\nCT, or FDGePETeCT in case of limited tumour burden, are\nrecommended for the staging of G2-3 NETs and NECs.24\nStaging of middle-ear HN-NENs is based on the system\nproposed by Marinelli et al.19 while staging of GUGy- and\nHN-NENs is based on the eighth edition of the Union for\nInternational Cancer Control (UICC) TNM (tumourenodee\nmetastasis) classiﬁcation25 (see Supplementary Tables S2-\nS10, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). There is no staging classiﬁcation for UKP-NENs\nunless an occult primary is identiﬁed by the initial diag-\nnostic work-up.\nPrognosis for all NENs relies on pathological grading and\nstaging. In patients with metastases, differentiation, WHO\ngrade, age, PS, tumour burden, SRI and/or FDG uptake, the\npresence of a functional syndrome at baseline and tumour\ngrowth rate should be considered for optimal risk assessment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 CT and/or MRI are recommended for staging. MRI should\nbe mainly considered in young patients to reduce irradi-\nation anddusing late arterial phase imagingdimprove\ndetection of hepatic, pancreatic, brain and bone NETs\n[III, A].\n\u0003 SRIePET is recommended for initial and preoperative\nstaging, and when indicated for restaging [V, A].\n\u0003 FDGePETeCT can be used for staging G2-3 NETs and\nNECs [IV, B].\n\u0003 Major independent prognostic factors are disease stage\n(TNM) and pathological features including differentiation\nand WHO grade [IV, A]. Age, PS, tumour burden, the pres-\nence of functional syndromes and tumour growth rate\nare additional prognostic factors [IV, B].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nPatients with UKP-NENs may present with lymph node\nmetastases without the detection of a primary tumour or\ndistant metastases. For G1-3 UKP-NETs, radical resection of\nlocoregional\ndisease\nis the\npreferred\ntreatment\n(see\nFigure 1). While searching for an occult primary, the site of\nlymph node metastasis may guide surgical exploration (e.g.\nan involved mesenteric node is suggestive of an ileal pri-\nmary). There is no evidence to support adjuvant therapy\nfollowing curative resection of NETs. For UKP-NECs, down-\nstaging of locoregional disease with chemotherapy (ChT)\nand/or radiotherapy (RT) may be considered before surgery.\nSome patients with NECs, particularly with isolated inguinal\nor neck nodes, may have prolonged disease control and\nsurvival following multimodal treatment including sur-\ngery.26 In this setting, Merkel-cell carcinoma should be ruled\nout. It is unclear whether post-operative treatment of NECs\nimproves\noutcomes,\nbut\nfour cycles of carboplatine\netoposide may be considered, particularly if neoadjuvant\nChT has not been used.27\nThere are no prospective data on the management of\nlocal and locoregional disease in patients with GUGy-NENs.\nRecommendations are therefore extrapolated from site-\nspeciﬁc ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs).28 For\nGUGy-NETs,\nupfront\nradical\nsurgery\nwithout\nadjuvant\ntreatment is recommended when feasible (see Figure 2);\nhowever, a conservative surgical approach should be dis-\ncussed whenever possible, particularly for low-grade local-\nised NETs. The role of adjuvant therapy for G3 GUGy-NETs is\nalso unknown. For GUGy-NECs, multimodal therapy should\nalways be discussed for localised disease. Further details\nregarding the management of local and locoregional GUGy-\nNENs are available in Section 4 of the Supplementary\nMaterial, available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.\n2024.103664.\nFor HN-NENs, locoregional treatment depends on the\nprimary site (see Figure 3). In the larynx, NETs are mainly\nsupraglottic and their sensitivity to ChT and RT may be low.\nBased\non\nretrospective\ndata,\nradical\nresection\nafter\ncompletion of whole body imaging (including PETeCT) is\nrecommended whenever possible with homolateral neck\ndissection, as it may lower the risk of regional lymph node\nrecurrence.8 Post-operative RT should be discussed in a\nmultidisciplinary meeting, particularly for G2 NETs.8 For\nlaryngeal NECs, treatment relies mainly on ChT and RT8;\nsurgery may be discussed in selected cases.29 For sinonasal\nNETs, surgery was associated with longer survival in retro-\nspective series.30,31 The role of prophylactic neck dissection\nis unknown. Post-operative RT should be discussed but\nthere is no evidence that it prevents locoregional relapse.\nFor sinonasal NECs, treatment should be multimodal.\nRetrospective data suggest that induction ChT is beneﬁ-\ncial,10 in combination with RT in most cases and surgery in\nselected cases.21,31 Most middle-ear tumours are NETs.\nSurgery is the mainstay of treatment,19,32 but complete\nresection with no tumour at the margin (R0) is challenging\nand there is a risk of locoregional relapse when ossicles are\nJ. Hadoux et al.\nESMO Open\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\n3\n\n---\ninvolved. There are no data on post-operative RT; however,\nRT may be discussed for patients with a higher risk of\nrelapse due to adherence to important neurovascular\nstructures. RT might prevent extension to the skull base and\nsubsequent\ndebilitating\ncomplications.\nThis\nmust\nbe\nbalanced against the risk of long-term RT-induced toxicity.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-NETs with locoregional disease, the\naim of surgical resection with exploration is to identify\nand treat the primary tumour with microscopic radical\nintent [V, A].\n\u0003 For GUGy-NETs, surgery of the primary tumour and nodes\nwith microscopic radical intent (according to site-speciﬁc\nESMO CPGs) is the treatment of choice for local and\nlocoregional disease, irrespective of grade [V, A]. A con-\nservative surgical approach should be discussed when-\never feasible, particularly in low-grade, early-stage NETs\n[V, B].\n\u0003 For laryngeal and sinonasal NETs, surgery of the primary\ntumour with microscopic radical intent and homolateral\ntherapeutic neck dissection is recommended whenever\npossible [IV, A].\n\u0003 Adjuvant treatment cannot be recommended for UKP-\nNETs [V, D] but adjuvant RT may be discussed for GUGy-\nNETs in patients with microscopic (R1) or macroscopic\n(R2) tumour at the margin and/or G3 disease [V, C].\n\u0003 For HN-NETs, adjuvant RT may be discussed after radical\nresection, particularly in case of locoregional spread,\nnon-R0 resection and G2 disease; however, the beneﬁt\nin terms of local control is unknown [V, C].\n\u0003 For locoregional sinonasal NECs, neoadjuvant ChT with\nplatinumeetoposide may be considered before surgical\nresection [IV, C].\n\u0003 For NECs treated with radical surgery, adjuvant therapy\nwith four cycles of platinumeetoposide may be consid-\nered [V, B].\n\u0003 Neoadjuvant ChT may be an option for UKP- and GUGy-\nNECs [V, C].\n\u0003 Combining RT with ChT is recommended for HN-NECs [IV,\nA] and could be discussed for UKP- and GUGy-NECs as\ndeﬁnitive or (neo)adjuvant treatment [V, C].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nFor UKP-NETs there are few clinical trials with low patient\nnumbers and for UKP-NECs there are only retrospective\nFigure 1.

For advanced or metastatic\nGUGy- and HN-NENs, neither retrospective nor prospective\nstudies are available. Thus, recommendations for the man-\nagement of UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NENs are based on the\nmanagement of NENs of GEP or lung origin and so systemic\ntreatments approved for GEP-NETs are used off-label in this\nsetting.28 When an occult primary is identiﬁed or suspected\n(such as a mesenteric mass from an ileal NET), its man-\nagement should follow the dedicated guideline.\nTreatment decisions (see Figure 4) should be based on\ncomprehensive multidisciplinary characterisation of the\ntumour (see ‘Staging and risk assessment’). In particular,\nWHO grade, differentiation (well versus poor),33 SSTR status\nbased on SRIePETeCT24 and presence of a functional syn-\ndrome should be considered.\nSurgery and locoregional therapies. Surgery should be\ndiscussed\nfor\nslowly\nproliferating\n(oligo)metastatic\ntumours in patients with G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs;\nthis includes surgical exploration for occult primary\nidentiﬁcation in case of UKP-NETs.34 Metastatic spread in\nHN-NETs frequently involves the skin, particularly in those\narising from the larynx.20,22 Skin metastases are usually\nmultiple and small in size, causing hard-to-treat pain and\ndiscomfort, which affects patients’ quality of life. In most\ncases, they are resistant to systemic treatment. Repeated\nlocoregional therapies may be used, including surgical\nresection, electrochemotherapy35 and RT for the largest\ntumours.22\nSomatostatin analogues. Two phase III trials [CLARINET\n(lanreotide) and PROMID (octreotide)] have reported longer\nprogression-free survival (PFS) or time to progression with\nsomatostatin analogue (SSA) treatment compared with\nplacebo in patients with metastatic GEP-NETs.

Based on data from the RADIANT-2,42\nRADIANT-343 and RADIANT-444 trials (NETs of various pri-\nmaries), everolimus monotherapy may be considered as\nﬁrst-line treatment for SSTR-negative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and\nHN-NETs, or as second-line treatment after SSAs in patients\nwith progressive disease. The RADIANT studies, however,\nincluded only 36 patients with UKP-NETs and no patients\nwith GUGy- or HN-NETs. Based on the randomised CABI-\nNET,45 AXINET46 and SANET-ep47 trials, antiangiogenic\nmultikinase inhibitors (MKIs) may be considered as alter-\nnatives to everolimus for ﬁrst-line treatment of SSTR-\nnegative G1-2 UKP-, GUGy- and HN-NETs, or for second-\nline treatment after SSAs in patients with progressive dis-\nease. These studies included 34-49 patients with UKP-NETs\nor NETs of other origin not otherwise speciﬁed (see Sec-\ntion 5 of the Supplementary Material, available at https://\ndoi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nChT. In patients with progressive G2 (Ki-67 >10%) and G3\nNETs, alkylating agent-based and oxaliplatin-based ChT\nregimens may be considered. Most data for management of\nG3 NETs with these regimens are from patients with\npancreatic NETs, with response rates of up to 30% and\nmedian PFS of 8-16 months.48 Loss of O-6-methylguanine-\nDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression or promoter\nhypermethylation may prompt use of alkylating agent-\nbased ChT (see Section 5 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664).49,50 For the management of NECs, ﬁrst-line\ncarboplatineetoposide or cisplatineetoposide is recom-\nmended based on retrospective series showing response\nrates of 40%-60%, median PFS of 4-6 months and median\noverall survival (OS) of 12 months.2,10,21,29,51 Carboplatine\netoposide or cisplatineetoposide should not be used for\nwell-differentiated NETs, regardless of grade.33,51\nFigure 3.

Follow-up carries\nthe risk of excessive radiation exposure, so low-dose CT (for\nlung metastases) or MRI should be used whenever possible,\nespecially in patients for whom prolonged follow-up is\nanticipated. There is a consensus for the use of molecular\nimaging for SSTR-positive NETs, especially SRI with [68Ga]Ga-\nDOTA-SSAePETeCT, at initial staging and for post-surgical\nrestaging, but not for routine follow-up.24 Molecular imag-\ning may play a role, however, in the follow-up of secondary\nlesions that are hard to evaluate with conventional imaging,\nsuch as peritoneal carcinomatosis and bone metastases.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected G1 and low G2 (Ki-\n67 <10%) UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-\ndose CT or MRI is recommended every 6 months for\n2 years, annually for years 3-5 and every second year\nthereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected G2 (Ki-67 \u000510%)\nand G3 UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NETs, follow-up using low-\ndose CT or MRI is recommended every 3 months for\n2 years, every 6 months in year 3, annually for years\n4-5 and every second year thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or\nHN-NECs,\nfollow-up\nshould\nbe\ncarried\nout\nevery\n2-3 months for 2 years, every 6 months in year 3 and\nthen discussed on a case-by-case basis thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with completely resected UKP-, GUGy- or HN-\nNENs, the best molecular imaging technique (according to\nSRIePET and/or FDGePETeCT positivity at initial staging)\nis recommended 6 months after resection and then in\ncase of unclear or abnormal imaging results [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual\nor metastatic disease, restaging is recommended every\n4-6 months [G1 and low G2 (Ki-67 <10%) NETs] or every\n3-4 months [G2 (Ki-67 \u000510%) and G3 NETs]; the interval\ncan be increased in case of stable disease [V, C].\n\u0003 For patients with UKP-, GUGy- or HN-NENs and residual or\nmetastatic disease, systematic follow-up using PET imaging\nis not recommended but may be considered in case of\ndoubtful or abnormal imaging results, increasing bio-\nmarkers, clinical suspicion of new metastasis (particularly\nin the bone) and/or depending on the metastatic sites\nand their measurability using conventional imaging, espe-\ncially when locoregional therapies are discussed [V, C].\n\u0003 Patientswithdisseminateddiseasemaybeneﬁtfromreferral\nto specialised palliative care units for appropriate pain treat-\nment, psychosocial support and rehabilitation [II, B].\nPARATHYROID CARCINOMA\nIncidence and epidemiology\nParathyroid carcinoma (PC) is a rare neoplasm, accounting\nfor <1% of primary hyperparathyroidism cases.56 PC affects\nmale and female patients with a mean age at diagnosis of\n50 years. PC occurs as a sporadic form, or less frequently as\nfamilial forms such as hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour\nsyndrome (HPT-JT; w15% of cases) linked to a germline\nmutation in the CDC73/HRPT2 gene.57 Rarely, it can occur as\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 (MEN1) or type\n2A (MEN2A).58 Even in the absence of a family history,\n20%-40% of patients with apparently sporadic PC have a\ngermline CDC73 mutation.58,59\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nDiagnosis.\nClinical presentation. PC can be suspected in patients\nwho present with severe primary hyperparathyroidism\ncharacterised by severe hypercalcaemia-related symptoms\nand markedly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels.\nLess than 10% of patients have normal serum calcium and\nPTH levels and present with a non-functional PC with only\nlocal symptoms, such as a palpable cervical mass, hoarse-\nness, dysphagia or dyspnoea.60\nLaboratory studies. Most patients with PC have markedly\nhigh levels of calcium (>14 mg/dl or 3.5 mmol/l) and non-\nsuppressed intact PTH 1-84 molecule (3-10 times above the\nupper limit of normal). The combined presence of high\nserum calcium (>3 mmol/l) and a parathyroid lesion >3 cm\n(the so-called ‘>3, >3 rule’), should raise suspicion of PC.\nSome patients with PC may overproduce N-terminal PTH\nfragment and have elevated serum and urinary levels of\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin; their determination could\nbe useful for differential diagnosis with benign adenoma,\nalthough this has only been tested in a small series.61\nImaging. Neck US is the ﬁrst-line imaging technique for\nthe diagnosis of parathyroid lesions. Its sensitivity varies\nfrom 67% to 96% with a positive predictive value of 89.7%-\n97%62; however, there are no speciﬁc patterns of malig-\nnancy (see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material,\navailable\nat\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.\n103664). Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with cytology and\nwashout PTH measurement can help to differentiate from\nlesions of other origins (e.g. thyroid, distant metastases\nfrom other tumours).63 Complications associated with the\nFNA procedure (including occasional seeding) are rare.64\nContrast-enhanced CT and MRI can be used in highly\nsuspicious cases to evaluate inﬁltration of surrounding tissue\nbut are not routinely carried out for differential diagnosis.65\nParathyroid\nscintigraphy\nwith\n[99mTc]Tc-sesta-methox-\nyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) single-photon emission CT (SPECT)\nor SPECTeCT, in combination with neck US, is the procedure\nof choice for preoperative identiﬁcation of hyperfunctioning\nparathyroids.

Nevertheless, there are\nno clear scintigraphic parameters that allow a real preoper-\native differential diagnosis between PC and adenoma.\nPET procedures such as [11C]-methionineePETeCT and\n[18F]-cholineePETeCT are effective for the diagnosis of pri-\nmary hyperparathyroidism but their added value in the dif-\nferential diagnosis between PC and adenoma is unknown.66\nPathology. Histological diagnosis of PC is based on the 2022\nWHO classiﬁcation criteria: (i) vascular invasion; (ii) lymphatic\ninvasion; (iii) perineural (intraneural) invasion; (iv) local ma-\nlignant invasion into adjacent anatomical structures; or (v)\nhistologically or cytologically documented metastatic disease.\nThe morphology of PC is usually reminiscent of parathyroid\nadenoma or hyperplasia.67,68 Features suggestive of malig-\nnancy and warranting a diagnosis of atypical adenoma [also\ncalled parathyroid neoplasm of uncertain malignant potential\nor atypical parathyroid tumour (APT)] are macroscopically\nevident necrosis, size >3 cm, weight >500 mg, mitotic index\n>5 mitoses/2 mm2 and the presence of atypical mitosis67,69\n(see Section 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Some rare\nvariants have been described, including oncocytic carcinomas\nand carcinosarcomas with more aggressive behaviour.70,71\nAlthough PC generally shows a higher proliferation index\n(Ki-67 6%-9% compared with <4% in adenoma), there is no\npredeﬁned Ki-67 cut-off to support or exclude a PC diagnosis.\nThe International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR)\nhas issued a dataset on PC and APT that covers PC grading,\nconsidering it high grade in the presence of sheets of pleo-\nmorphic enlarged nuclei, coagulative necrosis, abnormal\nmitosis and/or increased proliferation rate.69\nMolecular biology. The most frequent molecular alteration\nin PC is on the CDC73 gene (40%-50% of cases). Phospha-\ntidylinositol-3-kinase\n(PI3K)eprotein\nkinase\nb\n(AKT)e\nmammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is the most\nfrequently altered pathway (40%-80% of cases).65,72,73 IHC\nevaluation of paraﬁbromin loss of expression to identify a\ndouble-hit inactivation of the CDC73 gene is a recognised\nancillary diagnostic method for malignancy, as is evaluation\nof loss of p27, other types of cyclins or cell cycle regulators,\ngalectin-3 and protein gene product 9.5.69,74\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Genetic testing for germline CDC73 mutation should be\ncarried out to rule out HPT-JT in all patients with PC,\nincluding those without a family history [IV, A].\n\u0003 The combined presence of markedly elevated serum cal-\ncium [>12 mg/dl (>3 mmol/l)] and parathyroid lesions\n>3 cm should raise suspicion of PC [IV, B].\n\u0003 US of the neck should be carried out to assess lesions sus-\npicious for PC [IV, A].\n\u0003 Contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are used to evaluate\nlocoregional invasion before planning surgery [V, A].\n\u0003 FNA cytology and washout PTH measurements can be\nused to differentiate PC from other neck or thyroid nod-\nules but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [V, C].\n\u0003 [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBIeSPECT may be useful for the diag-\nnosis of PC but cannot differentiate it from adenoma [IV, C].\n\u0003 PC pathology reporting should follow the 2022 WHO clas-\nsiﬁcation (ﬁfth edition) and ICCR template [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nThe prognosis for patients with PC is variable, with 5- and 10-\nyear OS rates after surgery of w80% and 40%-80%, respec-\ntively. Good prognosis is associated with early diagnosis and\nradicality of initial surgery, whereas poor prognosis is mainly\nrelated to older age and the presence of lymph node me-\ntastases.75-79\nStaging is based on the eighth edition of the American\nJoint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM system (see\nSupplementary Table S11, available at https://doi.org/10.\n1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).80 Only 15%-30% of patients\nhave level VI lymph node metastases and one-third have\ndistant metastases, most commonly in the lung, liver or\nbone. The detection of locoregional or distant metastases is\nbased on neck US, thoracic and abdominal CT, or MRI.\nAmong nuclear medicine techniques, total body acquisi-\ntion with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI can identify possible extra-\ncervical uptake and unexpected lesions. FDGePETeCT can\nalso be applied as PC generally shows high FDG uptake. It\ncan be used to complement conventional imaging in the\ninitial staging and for residual or relapsing disease, albeit\nbased on limited data.81 Other PET tracers such as [11C]-\nmethionineePETeCT and [18F]-cholineePETeCT have not\nbeen validated for routine staging of PC.66,81,82\nRecommendations\n\u0003 PC staging should follow the eighth edition of the AJCC\nTNM system [IV, A].\n\u0003 Cross-sectional imaging is the reference method [V, A] but\nadditional FDGePETeCT may improve staging accuracy\n[IV, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nManagement of hypercalcaemia. Medical management of\nhypercalcaemia is the main treatment for patients awaiting\nsurgery and those with inoperable PC. Cinacalcet, a potent\nsecond-generation calcium mimetic, is effective for con-\ntrolling hypercalcaemia in patients with inoperable or\npersistent disease.83,84 The greatest reductions in calcium\nwere reported in patients with the highest serum calcium\nlevels before therapy. The cornerstones of treatment for\nsevere or symptomatic hypercalcaemia are intravenous sa-\nline hydration and bisphosphonate administration (see\nSection 7 of the Supplementary Material, available at\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664).\nSurgery. Surgery is the recommended ﬁrst-line treatment\nfor PC (Figure 6).85 Inadequate and non-radical surgery\nrepresent the strongest prognostic factors for recurrence\nand mortality. In case of high suspicion of PC, en bloc\nremoval of the parathyroid lesion avoiding capsule rupture\nand local seeding, homolateral thyroid lobo-isthmectomy\nand central node dissection are recommended.86\nESMO Open\nJ.

Analysis of data from the National Cancer Database\nidentiﬁed 885 patients with PC who underwent surgery\nbetween 2004 and 2016, including 126 (14.2%) who also\nreceived external beam RT. The latter group had a higher\nfrequency of extensive regional disease, nodal metastases\nand residual microscopic disease. The 5-year OS rate was\n85.3% with a median follow-up of 60.8 months. RT was not\nassociated with a difference in OS based on multivariate\nanalysis87; however, small series from highly specialised\ntertiary centres have reported lower locoregional relapse\nrates in patients undergoing adjuvant RT,88-90 particularly in\npatients with R1 or R2 resection.90 Although not recom-\nmended for all patients, adjuvant RT should be discussed in\nthe case of R1 or R2 resection and/or lymph node metas-\ntasis (Nþ) and/or persistent hypercalcaemia.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Medical treatment of hypercalcaemia is required before\nsurgery [V, A].\n\u0003 Cinacalcet is recommended to control hypercalcaemia [II,\nA].\n\u0003 Hydration with saline infusion, at a starting dose of 200-\n500 ml/h, is the ﬁrst step in the treatment of severe or\nsymptomatic hypercalcaemia [IV, A].\n\u0003 The bone antiresorptive drug zoledronic acid is recom-\nmended as ﬁrst-line treatment and should be preferred\nover pamidronate for severe or symptomatic hypercalcae-\nmia [II, A].\n\u0003 Denosumab is recommended in patients with resistant\nhypercalcaemia [III, A; FDA approved, not EMA approved].\n\u0003 When a preoperative diagnosis of PC is made, upfront\nsurgery with en bloc removal of the parathyroid lesion\n(avoiding capsule rupture and local seeding), homolateral\nthyroid lobo-isthmectomy and central node dissection is\nrecommended [IV, A].\n\u0003 In case of pathological diagnosis of PC after parathyroid-\nectomy,\nreoperation\nwith\nipsilateral\nthyroid\nlobo-\nisthectomy and\ncentral node\ndissection\nshould\nbe\ndiscussed within 1 month of initial surgery [IV, A].\nFigure 6.

Brown\ntumours (osteolytic lesions of the bone caused by hyper-\nparathyroidism) should be differentiated from bone me-\ntastases, but this may be difﬁcult as they can show FDG\nuptake; MRI can be useful to better characterise bone le-\nsions.91 In case of known distant metastases, the probability\nof achieving a complete response is low and frequently only\nlocoregional treatments can control the disease.92 Cina-\ncalcet should be continued in case of persistent severe\nhypercalcaemia.\nData on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in PC are\nscarce with only 79 patients reported in the literature be-\ntween 1898 and 2018.93 A recent pooled analysis of all\nmetastatic PC cases reported that the most frequent\ntreatments were dacarbazine or anthracycline-containing\nChT and antiangiogenic drugs.93 The most frequent ChT\nprotocols included dacarbazine monotherapy, dacarbazinee\n5-FU, cyclophosphamide monotherapy or methotrexatee\ndoxorubicinecyclophosphamideelomustine, but response\nrates were low.93 Most cases in which antiangiogenics were\nused involved sorafenib.94,95 PC is usually radioresistant;\ndespite limited data showing that RT can be applied as\nadjuvant therapy to reduce local recurrence, its role is\nmainly palliative.85\nRecommendations\n\u0003 The efﬁcacy of systemic treatment in advanced and met-\nastatic disease is limited; thus, whenever possible,\ndebulking surgery and/or locoregional treatments should\nbe discussed to control tumour burden and hormonal\nsecretion [V, A].\n\u0003 First-line systemic treatment may involve antiangiogenic\ndrugs [V, B] or alkylating agent-based ChT (dacarbazine,\ntemozolomide or streptozocin combined with 5-FU or\ncapecitabine) [V, C].\n\u0003 Inclusion in clinical trials should be prioritised whenever\npossible [V, A].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nThe reported risk of recurrence is w50% at 2-5 years (based\nmainly\non\ncases\nin\nwhich\nnon-radical\nsurgery\nwas\nused).56,75-77,79 Laboratory follow-up includes lifelong mea-\nsurement of calcium and PTH every 3 months, although\nlonger intervals (up to 4-6 months) are an option.79 Pro-\ngressive and repeated increases in PTH and calcium levels\nare suggestive of PC recurrence and cross-sectional imaging\n(neck US, CT and/or MRI) should be carried out to identify\nthe site of recurrence. There is no validated role for scin-\ntigraphy with [99mTc]Tc-sesta-MIBI in the follow-up of PC.\nRecurrences and distant metastases can be small or\nbelow the resolution of imaging (<1 cm), and occasionally\nPC can evolve towards aggressive and rapidly progressive\nforms and lose the ability for signiﬁcant uptake of [99mTc]Tc-\nsesta-MIBI. In these cases, FDGePET can complement\nconventional imaging.\nThe identiﬁcation of a germline CDC73 mutation should\nprompt periodic screening for tumours associated with HPT-\nJT (ossifying ﬁbromas of the mandible or maxilla, benign\nand malignant uterine involvement, renal cysts).58 Genetic\ntesting should be carried out in all family members of\naffected individuals. In ﬁrst-degree relatives, measurement\nof\nserum\ncalcium\nlevels\nand\nUS\nmonitoring\nare\nrecommended.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Lifelong laboratory follow-up, including measurement of\ncalcium and PTH, is recommended every 3-4 months\nduring the ﬁrst 2 years, every 6 months during the sub-\nsequent 3 years and annually thereafter [V, C].\n\u0003 In case of calcium and/or PTH elevation, neck US and CT\nscan of the neck, chest and abdomen together with a\nneck MRI are recommended [V, A]. FDGePET can be pro-\nposed to complete work-up, especially in rapidly pro-\ngressing cases [V, C].\nINTRATHYROID THYMIC CARCINOMA\nIncidence and epidemiology\nPreviously known as carcinoma showing thymus-like dif-\nferentiation (CASTLE), intrathyroid thymic carcinoma (ITC) is\nrare and believed to arise from the thymic remnants or\nbranchial pouch96 and, more rarely, from major salivary\nglands.97 ITC accounts for <0.15% of thyroid neoplasms.98\nFemales are affected slightly more frequently than males\nand the median age at diagnosis is 50 years.99\nDiagnosis, pathology and molecular biology\nITC presents as a slow-growing neck mass with hard con-\nsistency and poor mobility, located at the lower poles of the\nthyroid gland. It appears as a cold nodule on thyroid scin-\ntigraphy and as a solid, heterogenous and hypoechoic mass\non US. Most patients have locally advanced disease with\ninvasion of surrounding structures, including the recurrent\nlaryngeal nerve, strap muscle, trachea, oesophagus, soft\ntissues and skin. Cervical lymph nodes are frequently\ninvolved but few patients have distant metastases.99 At\ndiagnosis, w20% of patients have dyspnoea, dysphagia,\nright laryngeal nerve paralysis and pain. FNA does not\nprovide a deﬁnitive diagnosis; histological conﬁrmation is\nwarranted.\nITC exhibits histological and immunophenotypic re-\nsemblances to eutopic thymic carcinoma. The tumour cells\ngenerally grow in a solid or nested pattern, identical to\nsquamous-cell carcinoma arising in the thymus. Positive IHC\nresults for cluster of differentiation (CD)5, CD117 and p63\nsuggest\na\ndiagnosis\nof\nITC\n(see\nSection\n8\nof\nthe\nSupplementary Material, available at https://doi.org/10.\nESMO Open\nJ. Hadoux et al.\n12\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664\nVolume 9\n- Issue 10\n- 2024\n\n---\n1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Similar to thymomas and\nthymic carcinoma, on comparative genomic hybridisation\nITC is characterised by chromosomal imbalances such as\ngains on chromosomal arm 1q and losses on 6p, 6q and\n16q.100 The most frequently altered gene is the telomerase\nreverse transcriptase promoter mutation C228T, identiﬁed\nin 22% of cases.101 EGFR mutations have been docu-\nmented102 but their prevalence cannot be estimated due to\nthe limited number of cases analysed.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 ITC should be suspected in the presence of a cold nodule\nin the lower lobes of the thyroid gland with a cytological\ndiagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma [V, A].\n\u0003 Positive IHC for CD5, CD117 and p63 may allow for a pre-\noperative diagnosis [V, B].\n\u0003 Histological features that allow for a post-operative diag-\nnosis of ITC are lymphoid stroma, squamous-cell differen-\ntiation, infrequent mitoses and rare necrosis, positive IHC\nfor CD5, CD117 and p63, negative IHC for thyroglobulin,\nTTF-1 and calcitonin, and Ki-67 <20% [IV, A].\nStaging and risk assessment\nDisease stage is the main prognostic factor. Application of\nthe eighth edition of the UICC staging classiﬁcation25 for\nthyroid tumours is recommended, even if not speciﬁc for\nITC (see Supplementary Table S12, available at https://doi.\norg/10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103664). Neck US, CT of the\nneck, thorax and abdomen, and neck MRI can be used for\nstaging. On CT, ITC appears as a well-deﬁned soft tissue\ndensity without calciﬁcation, whereas on MRI, it appears as\nan isointense and hyperintense mass on T1/T2-weighted\nimages.103 Similar to thymoma, ITC can show intense up-\ntake on FDGePETeCT; however, data on the use of FDGe\nPETeCT in patients with ITC are very limited.104\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Accurate assessment of local extension with US or MRI is\ncrucial for planning appropriate surgical intervention\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 CT of the chest and abdomen should be carried out to\nrule out the rare possibility of distant synchronous metas-\ntasis [V, A]. Complementary FDGePETeCT may be useful\nin some cases [V, C].\nManagement of local and locoregional disease\nSurgery is the treatment of choice (Figure 7). A pooled\nanalysis of published cases99 showed that thyroidectomy\n(total, subtotal or near total) was the most frequent surgical\nprocedure. Due to frequent nodal involvement at diagnosis,\nneck lymph node dissection [i.e. modiﬁed radical neck\ndissection (levels I-V), selective neck dissection of central\ncompartment (level VI) or lateral selective neck dissection\n(levels II-IV)] was carried out in >55% of cases. Among\npatients with a small ITC, 40% underwent thyroid lobec-\ntomy without lymph node dissection. RT was used in only\ntwo cases of locally advanced ITC not amenable to surgery\nwith radical intent.\nThe prognosis for patients with local or locoregional\ndisease is very good. In the pooled analysis,99 estimated\nmedian disease-free survival was 144 months (range 91-197\nmonths), median OS was not reached and w85% of\nFigure 7.

Based on these data,\nsurgery is recommended as the ﬁrst-line therapeutic option\nin patients with ITC with locoregional disease. The type of\nsurgery (i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be plan-\nned according to the available guideline for thyroid can-\ncers,28 using conservative surgical treatment whenever\npossible. Adjuvant RT does not improve prognosis and can\nbe avoided in most patients, although it may be discussed\nfor more advanced or aggressive cases. There is no role for\nadjuvant ChT. Patients with locoregional disease not\namenable to surgery with radical intent could be offered RT\nor chemoradiotherapy (CRT).\nRecommendations\n\u0003 Surgery is the mainstay of therapy. The type of surgery\n(i.e. lobectomy or thyroidectomy) should be planned ac-\ncording to the available guidelines for thyroid cancers\n[IV, A].\n\u0003 Due to the indolent course of the disease and its good\nprognosis, conservative surgical treatment is preferred\nwhenever possible [V, B].\n\u0003 Neck dissection should be carried out according to guide-\nlines for thyroid cancers [V, A].\n\u0003 RT or CRT are reasonable options in case of locally\nadvanced disease not suitable for radical surgery [V, B].\n\u0003 If possible, adjuvant RT should be avoided due to the\nindolent disease course of ITC [IV, D]. It is an option in\nselected cases after careful multidisciplinary discussion\n[IV, B].\nManagement of advanced and metastatic disease\nAmong 120 patients with ITC who underwent primary\ntumour resection, 29 (24%) experienced recurrence at a\nmedian of 19 months (range 13-25 months).99 The recur-\nrence was locoregional in 21 patients (72%), and was\ntreated surgically in 90% and using RT in 42% of cases, with\nexcellent prognosis. A minority (w10%) of patients devel-\noped distant metastases; ﬁve patients (4%) had metastases\nat diagnosis and eight (6%) developed metachronous\ndistant metastases. The most common metastatic site was\nthe lung. Data on the efﬁcacy of systemic treatments in\npatients with metastatic ITC are limited. Similar to the\nrecommendations for locally advanced or metastatic thy-\nmoma or thymic carcinoma,28 cisplatin-containing regimens\nhave been used in most ITC cases, with a reported objective\nremission rate of 58%.99 Immunotherapy with the immune\ncheckpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab was used in one case,\nresulting in long-lasting disease control. Based on this single\nexperience, it is not possible to recommend immuno-\ntherapy for the treatment of metastatic ITC.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In case of local recurrence, salvage surgery is recommen-\nded [IV, A] and adjuvant RT may be discussed by an MTB\nfor patients who have not received prior RT [V, B].\n\u0003 In case of metastatic disease, cisplatin-based combination\nChT regimens with either doxorubicin and cyclophospha-\nmide or etoposide are the recommended options [V, B].\nFollow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\nFollow-up is aimed at identifying locoregional recurrences\nand, more rarely, distant recurrences, usually within the ﬁrst\n5 years after initial treatment.\nRecommendations\n\u0003 In localised disease, neck US and CT scan of the neck and\nthorax are recommended 6-12 months after initial treat-\nment and then annually up to 5 years [V, C].\n\u0003 In metastatic disease, follow-up by CT and/or MRI (in case\nof liver, bone or brain metastases) every 3-6 months is rec-\nommended, depending on the tumour growth rate [V, A].\nMETHODOLOGY\nThis CPG was developed in accordance with the ESMO\nstandard\noperating\nprocedures\nfor\nCPG\ndevelopment\n(https://www.esmo.org/Guidelines/ESMO-Guidelines-\nMethodology).

    "llm_raw_output": "```xml\n<beurteilung>\nDie Patientin präsentiert sich mit einem fortgeschrittenen, metastasierten Parathyreoidkarzinom (Stadium IVc), das sich durch eine ausgedehnte lokale Invasion in den Hals und multiple Fernmetastasen in Lunge und Knochen manifestiert. Die Diagnose wurde histologisch bestätigt. Die Patientin ist derzeit asymptomatisch bezüglich der Metastasen, leidet jedoch unter Symptomen der lokalen Invasion (Dysphagie, Dysphonie) und der Hyperkalzämie (obwohl aktuell durch Medikation kontrolliert). Die Patientin ist 68 Jahre alt und hat eine gute Performance-Status (ECOG 0).\n\nDie Situation erfordert eine multidisziplinäre Behandlung, da eine kurative Therapie nicht mehr möglich ist. Die primären Ziele der Behandlung sind die Kontrolle der lokalen Symptome, die Kontrolle der Hyperkalzämie, die Linderung der Symptome durch die Metastasen und die Verbesserung der Lebensqualität. Eine palliative Therapie ist indiziert.\n</beurteilung>\n\n<therapieempfehlung>\n1.  **Lokale Behandlung:**\n    *   **Chirurgische Resektion:** Eine R0-Resektion der primären Tumormasse und der befallenen Halslymphknoten sollte angestrebt werden, um die lokale Symptomatik (Dysphagie, Dysphonie) zu lindern und die lokale Tumorkontrolle zu verbessern. Dies erfordert eine enge Zusammenarbeit mit einem erfahrenen Kopf-Hals-Chirurgen und einem plastischen Chirurgen. Die Machbarkeit muss im Rahmen einer präoperativen Bildgebung (MRT, CT) und ggf. einer Biopsie beurteilt werden.\n    *   **Strahlentherapie:** Eine postoperative adjuvante Strahlentherapie sollte in Erwägung gezogen werden, insbesondere bei unvollständiger Resektion (R1) oder bei hohem Rezidivrisiko (z.B. positive Resektionsränder, Lymphknotenbefall). Eine palliative Strahlentherapie kann zur Linderung der lokalen Symptome (Schmerzen, Dysphagie) eingesetzt werden, wenn eine Operation nicht möglich ist oder abgelehnt wird.\n\n2.  **Systemische Therapie:**\n    *   **Chemotherapie:** Eine platinbasierte Chemotherapie (z.B. Cisplatin oder Carboplatin in Kombination mit Paclitaxel oder Gemcitabin) sollte als Erstlinienbehandlung in Erwägung gezogen werden, um die systemische Tumorkontrolle zu verbessern und das Fortschreiten der Metastasen zu verlangsamen. Die Wahl des Regimes sollte unter Berücksichtigung des Performance-Status der Patientin und möglicher Komorbiditäten erfolgen.\n    *   **Targeted Therapy/Immuntherapie:** Derzeit gibt es keine etablierten zielgerichteten Therapien oder Immuntherapien für Parathyreoidkarzinome. Die Teilnahme an klinischen Studien sollte in Erwägung gezogen werden, falls verfügbar.\n\n3.  **Management der Hyperkalzämie:**\n    *   Die aktuelle Medikation (Bisphosphonate, Kalzimimetika) sollte fortgesetzt und angepasst werden, um die Kalzämwerte im Zielbereich zu halten. Regelmäßige Überwachung der Kalzämwerte ist erforderlich.\n\n4.  **Supportive Therapie:**\n    *   Schmerzmanagement, Ernährungsberatung und psychosoziale Unterstützung sind wichtige Bestandteile der palliativen Versorgung.\n    *   Regelmäßige Überwachung des Krankheitsverlaufs mittels Bildgebung (CT/MRT) und Laboruntersuchungen (Kalzäm, Tumormarker, Nierenfunktion).\n\n5.  **Multidisziplinäre Diskussion:**\n    *   Die Behandlung sollte in einem multidisziplinären Tumorboard (Chirurgie, Onkologie, Radiologie, Pathologie, Endokrinologie) diskutiert werden, um die optimale Behandlungsstrategie für die Patientin festzulegen.\n</therapieempfehlung>\n\n<begründung>\nDie Therapieempfehlung basiert auf den aktuellen ESMO-Leitlinien für Parathyreoidkarzinome und berücksichtigt die spezifische Situation der Patientin.\n\n*   **Lokale Behandlung:** Eine chirurgische Resektion ist der primäre Ansatz zur Behandlung der lokalen Symptome und zur Verbesserung der lokalen Kontrolle. Die postoperative Strahlentherapie kann das Rezidivrisiko reduzieren.\n*   **Systemische Therapie:** Eine platinbasierte Chemotherapie ist die Standardbehandlung für fortgeschrittene Parathyreoidkarzinome, um das Tumorwachstum zu kontrollieren und die Lebensdauer zu verlängern.\n*   **Hyperkalzämie-Management:** Die Kontrolle der Hyperkalzämie ist entscheidend für die Symptomlinderung und die Vermeidung von Komplikationen.\n*   **Multidisziplinäre Betreuung:** Eine koordinierte Betreuung durch ein erfahrenes multidisziplinäres Team ist für die optimale Versorgung von Patienten mit fortgeschrittenen Parathyreoidkarzinomen unerlässlich.\n\nDie Patientin hat einen guten Performance-Status (ECOG 0), was sie zu einer geeigneten Kandidatin für eine intensive Therapie (Chirurgie, Chemotherapie) macht. Die Ziele der Behandlung sind palliativ, mit dem Fokus auf Symptomkontrolle und Lebensqualitätserhaltung. Die Prognose ist ungünstig, aber eine multimodale Therapie kann die Lebensdauer verlängern und die Symptome lindern.\n</begründung>\n```",
