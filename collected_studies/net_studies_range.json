      "status": "ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING",

      "condition": "Cutaneous Melanoma",
      "intervention": "Nivolumab (480 mg infusion); NeoVax plus Montanide; Ipilimumab",
      "brief_summary": "This research study is investigating a new type of personalized neoantigen vaccine, NeoVax, plus Montanide® in combination with Ipilimumab (Yervoy™) and Nivolumab (Opdivo®) as a possible treatment for cutaneous melanoma.\n\nThe drugs involved in this study are:\n\n* Personalized Neoantigen Vaccine\n* Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®)\n* Montanide®\n* Ipilimumab (Yervoy™)\n* Nivolumab (Opdivo®)",
      "detailed_description": "This is a Phase I clinical trial to assess the safety of an investigational personalized neoantigen vaccine, NeoVax, consisting of personalized neoantigen peptides and Hiltonol® plus Montanide®, in combination with Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. The study also seeks to define the appropriate dose of investigational Ipilimumab administered subcutaneously (under the skin) to use for further studies. \"Investigational\" means that the combination is being studied. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved personalized neoantigen peptides, Hiltonol®, or Montanide® as a treatment for any disease. The combination is an investigational therapy being developed for use in the treatment of certain cancers. The FDA has approved Nivolumab (Opdivo®) and intravenous Ipilimumab (Yervoy™) as a treatment option for melanoma. Subcutaneous administration of Ipilimumab has not been approved by the FDA for treatment of melanoma.\n\nIt is known that melanoma cancers have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to each patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that the proteins used in a vaccine may cause strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could allow the melanoma to come back in the future.\n\nIn this study, melanoma cells will be obtained either by tumor surgery or tumor biopsy. The genetic material contained in the melanoma cells will be examined for the presence of tumor-specific mutations. This information will be used to prepare small protein fragments, which are called \"peptides\". Each NeoVax vaccine will consist of up to 20 peptides mixed with two drugs that activate the immune system called Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol®) and Montanide®.\n\nA 5-patient dose escalation design will be implemented with up to three cohorts of patients. Each cohort of patients (5 patients/cohort) will begin treatment with Nivolumab (480 mg intravenously every 4 weeks). The NeoVax vaccine will be prepared during the initial 12 weeks of Nivolumab therapy. Any patient for whom vaccine cannot be made will be replaced within a cohort. Vaccine will be administered on weeks 12, 15, 18, and 21 with Hiltonol, Montanide, and concurrent Ipilimumab. The protocol specifies that the dose of Ipilimumab will begin at 2.5 mg per injection site. If the number of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurring within 7 weeks of NeoVax initiation is 0 or 1 (i.e., in no more than 20% of patients) the dose of Ipilimumab will be increased to 5 mg per injection site in the next cohort. If the number of DLTs is 2 or more, the dose of Ipilimumab will be decreased to 1.25 mg per injection site in the next cohort. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be the highest dose of Ipilimumab in which the DLT rate is 20% or less.\n\nToxicities will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE 5.0).\n\nA DLT is defined as:\n\n1. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity that is definitely, probably, or possibly related to administration of vaccine, excluding transient (≤ 72 hours) flu-like symptoms; grade 3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation that returns to grade 2 (or lower) within 48 hours; any grade 3 rash that resolves to grade 2 or lower within 14 days; any grade 3 endocrine abnormality that is corrected with hormonal therapy within 4 weeks.\n2. Grade 3 or 4 abnormal laboratory value that is at least possibly related to the administration of vaccine lasting for more than 7 days and requires hospitalization or medical intervention. Excludes any grade 3 electrolyte abnormality that: lasts ≤ 72 hours, is not clinically complicated, and resolves spontaneously or responds to conventional medical intervention.\n3. Any grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity that is considered, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, to be dose-limiting.\n4. Any death related to study treatment.\n\nHealth status assessments, including physical exams and blood chemistry, will be conducted every 4 weeks. Leukapheresis will occur at the time of enrollment, prior to administration of the first dose of NeoVax, and at week 20. For patients with unresectable melanoma, tumor biopsies will be obtained prior to the first dose of vaccine, at week 20, and at the time of disease progression. Vaccine site biopsies will be obtained at weeks 15 and 18 (i.e., at the times of the second and third vaccine administration).",

      "brief_summary": "The current commercially available MEKTOVI® (binimetinib) 15 mg tablets are provided as immediate release film-coated tablets for oral administration. For the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600 mutation, the recommended dosing regimen is 45 mg twice daily (bis in die, BID). No food effect with the commercial formulation of 15 mg was demonstrated. In order to reduce the patient's burden, a new strength tablet containing 45 mg of binimetinib as active ingredient is being developed. As a result, the number of tablets to be taken by the patients will be reduced from 6 tablets (6 x 15 mg) to 2 tablets (2 x 45 mg) per day. The evaluation of the bioequivalence between one 45 mg tablet and three 15 mg tablets is therefore required.",

The hypothesis is that HG-NEC (excluding small cell carcinoma) can be segregated based on mutational analysis and that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assignment of therapy is feasible and will potentially improve the outcomes.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nThere is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.\n\nLCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015 World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.\n\nLCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.\n\nBased on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).\n\nSimilarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.\n\nTreatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent, driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently defined a new subtype of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in large-cell carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example.\n\nTo date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapies for metastatic HG-NECs, based on mutational profiles. This study will utilize recent genomic profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of optimal treatments.",

      "intervention": "Ipilimumab; Nivolumab; Troriluzole; Placebo",
      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this research is to test the safety and effectiveness of the investigational combination of Troriluzole, ipilimumab, and nivolumab, and to learn whether this combination works in treating melanoma that has spread to the brain.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, phase II signal-detection trial with a non-randomized safety run-in to assess the efficacy and safety of adding troriluzole to ipilimumab/nivolumab induction and nivolumab maintenance in patients with melanoma that has metastasized to the brain. Measuring the shrinking or growth of melanoma in participants will allow researchers to learn about these study drugs and provide information on the safety and effectiveness of this combination in treating melanoma.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved Troriluzole as a treatment for any disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved nivolumab, ipilimumab, and the combination of these two drugs as treatment options for melanoma that has metastasized to the brain.\n\nIpilimumab and nivolumab are drugs that treat cancer by blocking certain molecules in the body. This blocking action prevents other molecules from binding to cells involved in the immune system. With these changes, the immune system is more likely to become active, and will react more intensely when activated. The immune system is able to destroy cancer cells and reduce the size of tumors, so activating the immune system is an important part of cancer treatment. Ipilimumab blocks a molecule called cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4), which normally decreases the activation of the immune system by binding to T-Cells, which are important immune system cells that can attack cancer cells. Nivolumab blocks a molecule called programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), which also normally decreases the activation of the immune system.\n\nTroriluzole is a drug that modulates glutamate, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the human body. The primary mode of action of Troriluzole is reducing synaptic levels of glutamate. This may change parts of the immune system in the brain, which is could improve treatment outcomes with anti-cancer drugs such as ipilimumab and nivolumab that can work in the brain. This study is testing Troriluzole's ability to increase the effectiveness of ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment in melanoma that has spread to the brain, as well as testing the safety of the combination of these three drugs.\n\nParticipation in this research is expected to last up to 4 years: 1 year of treatment and 3 years of follow up.\n\nAbout 108 subjects will take part in this research.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma. All melanoma subtypes are included, except for ocular melanoma.\n* Participants must have measurable disease in the brain (intraparenchymal brain metastases), defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in at least one dimension as ≥5 mm and ≤ 3 cm in longest diameter. See Section 11 (Measurement of Effect) for the evaluation of measurable disease. Measurable disease in the extracranial compartment (body) is not required. Measurable lesions may not have received previous treatment with radiation therapy. Prior stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT; e.g. GammaKnife, CyberKnife) is allowed for lesions other than the lesions selected as measurable target lesions. Prior craniotomy with resection of brain metastases is allowed.\n* Participants must have received prior systemic treatment with anti-PD-1 therapy (e.g. pembrolizumab, or nivolumab) in any setting (neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic). Prior anti-CTLA-4 monotherapy is allowed (e.g. ipilimumab). Prior targeted therapy (e.g. BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors) is allowed.\n* Age ≥18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of troriluzole in participants \\<18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatric trials.\n* ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (see Appendix A).\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/mcL\n  * total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), or in the case of Gilbert's disease ≤ 3x ULN\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤3 × institutional ULN\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months are eligible for this trial.\n* For participants with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated.\n* Participants with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For participants with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.\n* Participants with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, participants should be class 2B or better.\n* The effects of troriluzole on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because ipilimumab is a pregnancy category C, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence from heterosexual intercourse) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of all study drugs. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of all study drugs.\n* Ability to swallow pills.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Ocular subtype of melanoma.\n* Cytologically confirmed leptomeningeal metastases, or convincing imaging evidence of leptomeningeal spread.\n* Prior whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT).\n* Prior combination therapy with concurrent ipilimumab (3 mg/kg IV) + nivolumab (1 mg/kg IV) in the 24 months prior to the date of registration.\n* Participants who have had systemic therapy (immunotherapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy), radiotherapy, or major surgery within 3 weeks prior to the date of registration.\n* Participants who require immediate local treatment (surgical resection or radiosurgery) of brain metastases due to neurological symptoms, or brain metastases located in sensitive areas of the brain requiring immediate local treatment.\n* Participants who have required systemic steroids to manage neurologic symptoms (seizures, cerebral edema, severe headache, nausea/vomiting, etc.) within 1 week prior to the date of registration.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents for cancer or neurologic disease.\n* Extreme claustrophobia that would interfere with performing brain MRIs or severe allergy to gadolinium contrast.\n* History of severe or life-threatening allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to troriluzole, riluzuole, ipilimumab, or nivolumab.\n* Second primary malignancy that is a competing cause of death in the opinion of the treating investigator (prognosis \\< 6 months).\n* Patients with a history of solid organ transplant, or allogeneic bone marrow transplant.\n* Active autoimmune disease or any other condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\>10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other systemic immunosuppressive medications within 3 weeks of registration.\n* History of grade 4 immune related adverse event from prior cancer treatment, (with the exception of asymptomatic elevation of serum amylase or lipase).\n* History of immune-related adverse event from prior cancer immunotherapy treatment that has not improved to grade 0-1 (with the exception of patients with ongoing thyroid, adrenal or gonadal insufficiency requiring continued medical treatment, vitiligo, or asymptomatic elevation of serum amylase or lipase).\n* Participants receiving any medications or substances that are inhibitors or inducers of the liver enzyme Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2, including fluvoxamine, cimetidine, amiodarone, efavirenz, fluoroquinolones (including ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), fluvoxamine, furafylline, interferon, methoxsalen, mibefradil, or ticlopidine. These medications must be discontinued at least 7 days prior to registration.\n* Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness.\n* Participants with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Pregnant and nursing (breastfeeding) women are excluded from this study because the effects of troriluzole on the developing human fetus are unknown, and because ipilimumab is pregnancy category",

      "intervention": "Apalutamide; Cetrelimab",
      "brief_summary": "Despite the low androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer, there is persistent AR expression observed in the majority of treatment-emergent small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-SCNC) biopsies. This indicates that epigenetic dysregulation leads to reprogramming away from an AR-driven transcriptional program. Therefore, continuation of AR blockade in the form of apalutamide may provide additive benefit compared to immune checkpoint blockade alone. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of apalutamide plus cetrelimab will achieve a clinically significant composite response rate with sufficient durability of response in mCRPC patients with evidence of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer",
      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 2, single arm, Simon's two-stage evaluation of the combination of apalutamide plus cetrelimab in patients with mCRPC and histologic and/or genomic evidence of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer who have previously progressed on at least one prior androgen signaling inhibitor.\n\nParticipants may continue study treatment from the time of treatment initiation until confirmed radiographic progressive disease (PD) per PCWG3 and RECIST 1.1 criteria, unequivocal clinical progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal, whichever occurs first, for a maximum of 24 months.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the composite response rate as defined by achieving one or more of the following at any time point during study treatment:\n\n1. Decline from baseline in serum PSA of \\>= 50% (PSA50), confirmed by repeat measurement \\>= 4 weeks later and/or\n2. Objective response by RECIST 1.1 criteria\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine safety of the combination as determined by CTCAE version 5.0.\n\nII. To determine the median radiographic progression-free survival by PCWG3 criteria.\n\nIII.

Breast cancer was a type of cancer when cells in the breast turn into cancer cells, which might grow out of control. Melanoma was a type of skin cancer that starts in cells called melanocytes. These cells made a substance called melanin which gives the skin its color. In this study, people had surgery to remove the lymph node closest to the site of their cancer. This lymph node was called the sentinel node. This was done to check if the cancer had spread from the original site to the sentinel node. This procedure was called a sentinel node biopsy.\n\nThis study provided more information on a potential new dye, called ASP5354, used in sentinel node biopsies. ASP5354 helped to show the lymph nodes more clearly during surgery. This helped the surgeon find the lymph node closest to the site of the cancer (sentinel node).\n\nThe main aim of the study was to find the best dose of ASP5354 that clearly showed the lymph nodes during surgery. This was an open-label study. That means each person in the study and the study doctors knew that person received ASP5354.\n\nEach person only received 1 dose of ASP5354.\n\nPeople that wanted to take part in the study were checked by a study doctor. This was on a separate visit before their surgery. Before surgery, people who took part in the study were asked if they had any other medical problems. They had a physical exam, an ECG to check their heart rhythm, and had their vital signs checked (blood pressure, pulse rate, and breathing rate). Other checks included some blood and urine samples taken for laboratory tests.\n\nDuring surgery, a study surgeon injected ASP5354 near the cancer site. They recorded how clearly they could see the lymph nodes. Some blood samples were taken for laboratory tests and an ECG was done. After their surgery, people were asked if they have any other medical problems.\n\nPeople returned to the hospital 9 days later for a check-up. The check-up included a physical exam, an ECG to check their heart rhythm, and a check of their vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, and breathing rate). Other checks included some blood samples taken for laboratory tests. People were asked if they had any medical problems and asked to complete a feedback survey.",

The study is a pre-marketing, prospective, confirmatory, first in clinical setting, pivotal multi-centre, non-interventional clinical investigation to evaluate the clinical safety, performance and benefit of Dermalyzer in patients with cutaneous lesions where malignant melanoma (MM) cannot be ruled out.\n\nPrimary objective: The primary objective of the investigation is to determine the diagnostic precision of the device; to answer at which level the AI tool Dermalyzer can identify malignant melanomas among cutaneous lesions that are assessed in clinical use due to any degree of malignancy suspicion.\n\nSecondary objectives: A) To evaluate usability and applicability in clinical praxis of Dermalyzer by users (medical professionals), B)To gain an increased knowledge and understanding of how digital tools enhanced co-artificial intelligence can assist physicians with the right support for an earlier diagnosis of malignant melanoma.\n\nExploratory objective: To explore health economic aspects of improved diagnosis support\n\nMethods: The subjects will be included from around 30 primary care centers in Sweden. If the subject's lesion(s) is suspected of melanoma or melanoma cannot be ruled out, the subject is asked to participate in the investigation. The investigator examines the subject's lesion(s) and makes the clinical assessment of the subject lesion(s) based on established clinical decision algorithms The investigator takes dermoscopy images according to standard of care and archives the image(s) according to clinical routine. The investigator decides on action, based on his or her MM suspicion (excision at the primary care center or referral for excision or referral to a dermatologist for further assessment). The investigator takes images of the lesion(s) again, this time with a mobile phone, containing the AI software, connected to a dermatoscope, and follows the on-screen instructions.

      "detailed_description": "Background: Malignant melanoma is a worldwide health issue of concern, of increasing incidence. Early melanoma detection is crucial for survival and prognosis. Dermalyzer is a device intended to be used as a decision support system for assessing cutaneous lesions suspected of being melanomas, based on artificial intelligence (AI), often referred to as \"machine learning\". The input from the device is not intended to be used as the sole source of information for diagnosis. Intended to be used by medical professionals. The service does not provide any other diagnosis.\n\nStudy aims/objectives:\n\nPrimary objective: The primary objective of the investigation is to determine the diagnostic precision of the device; to answer at which level the AI tool Dermalyzer can identify malignant melanomas among cutaneous lesions that are assessed in clinical use due to any degree of malignancy suspicion.\n\nSecondary objectives: A) To evaluate usability and applicability in clinical praxis of Dermalyzer by users (medical professionals), and B) To gain an increased knowledge and understanding of how digital tools enhanced co-artificial intelligence can assist physicians with the right support for an earlier diagnosis of malignant melanoma.\n\nExploratory objective: To explore health economic aspects of improved diagnosis support Exploratory endpoints\n\nMaterials \\& methods:\n\nThe subjects will be included from around 30 primary care centers in Sweden. If the subject's lesion(s) is suspected of melanoma or melanoma cannot be ruled out, the subject is asked to participate in the investigation. The investigator examines the subject's lesion(s) and makes the clinical assessment of the subject lesion(s) based on established clinical decision algorithms (such as \"Chaos \\& clues\", \"3- or 7-point checklist\", or the ABCDE concept) of whether there is a suspicion of MM, according to the usual clinical routine (also includes very low suspicion of MM but cannot be completely dismissed). The investigator takes dermoscopy images according to standard of care and archives the image(s) according to clinical routine. The investigator decides on action, based on his or her MM suspicion (excision at the primary care center or referral for excision or referral to a dermatologist for further assessment). If the subject has agreed to participate in the investigation, the investigator indicates in the CRF the clinical suspicion level of MM, and decided action. The investigator takes images of the lesion(s) again, this time with a mobile phone, containing the IMD AI SW, connected to a dermatoscope, and follows the on-screen instructions. The image is processed by the AI SW and the results are visible on the screen within seconds. A unique auto generated code number is also presented. The code number is registered on the enrollment log and in the CRF. The investigator records how he considers that the degree of suspicion of MM (higher vs lower) would have been affected by the AI SW result if it had been the governing body for the treatment.\n\nWhen the subject has been fully examined and receives the final tumor diagnosis from the histopathology/PAD results or dermatologist assessment (melanoma/non melanoma), the degree of agreement between the PAD and the outcome of the AI SW decision support is calculated with the Kappa-analysis and the diagnostic accuracy to be able to distinguish melanoma from non-melanoma in the form of sensitivity and specificity as well the positive and predictive value. The corresponding comparison is performed from the examining investigators estimated clinical degree of suspicion, as well as the diagnostic accuracy when both the PAD and the AI decision support are wigheted together (ei in cases where the investigator and the decisions support are in agreement in their assessment). The clinical investigation will collect information from the users, how participating users (investigators at the site) experience the usability of the AI SW decision support and attaching applications, from short surveys including the validated System Usability Scale.",

      "brief_summary": "It is well known that the prevalence of malnutrition or risk of malnutrition in cancer patients is high, as well as its impact on different parameters such as hospitalization, survival or response to certain treatments. In patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), due to their heterogeneity and longer survival, it is expected that the prevalence of malnutrition is probably underdiagnosed, as well as the existence of a negative impact on different parameters (quality of life, survival). So far, the studies carried out on nutrition and NET are very scarce and none has been carried out so far in Spain.\n\nBefore being able to carry out nutritional intervention studies on these patients, it is necessary to know the reality of the nutritional status of patients with NETs in Spain. The main motivation for the NUTRIGETNE study is to evaluate the epidemiological status of nutrition in NETs in the spanish population. In addition to know the epidemiological picture, it is intended to study the nutritional status from different points of view: analytical, clinical, anthropometric, etc. Besides, the study of nutritional status will allow us to closely monitor the patients who have a higher risk of malnutrition and to propose early interventions for those, as well as the impact of their nutritional status on different parameters: survival, hospitalization, quality of life or responses to the treatments.\n\nNUTRIGETNE is a cross-sectional, open and multicenter study in which the nutritional status of patients with GEP NET in Spain will be evaluated.",

      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nTargeted therapies designed for specific genetic alterations, known as cancer driver mutations, have changed the treatment paradigm in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective in NSCLC with activating mutation in the EGFR. Although most patients achieve robust responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with tumor shrinkage and symptomatic relief, drug resistance eventually develops in the majority of patients.\n\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation has been reported as one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.\n\nSeveral phase III trials showed durable response with poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the breast and ovarian cancer with breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation, a tumor suppressor gene involving homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, and several PARP inhibitors are now Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for these cancers.\n\nImmune checkpoint blockade appears to be most effective against hypermutated tumors, suggesting that clinical responses correlate with an increased propensity to produce neoantigens.\n\nEGFR-mutated transformed SCLC is an aggressive cancer whose clinical course is similar to that of SCLC. There are no standard treatments for this disease and prospective studies have not been conducted to date. Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone are not effective for EGFR-mutated transformed SCLC. Analyses of EGFR transformed SCLC tumors suggest that these tumors are HRR deficient.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo assess the efficacy of a combination of durvalumab and olaparib with respect to best overall response (BOR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST 1.1) in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that transform to SCLC and other neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nEligibility:\n\nSubjects with initial diagnosis of EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and histologically or cytologically confirmed transformation to small cell/neuroendocrine tumors following treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\nSubjects should have received platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy for small cell/neuroendocrine transformation or refused such therapy.\n\nAge \\>=18 years.\n\nSubjects must have measurable disease.\n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \\<= 2\n\nAdequate organ function\n\nDesign:\n\n-This is an open label Phase II study evaluating the combination of durvalumab and olaparib\n\nin participants with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma and histologically or cytologically confirmed transformation to small cell/neuroendocrine tumors following treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\nPatients will be treated with durvalumab (1,500 mg), intravenous (IV), every 28 days and olaparib (300 mg twice a day (BID) for total daily dose of 600 mg) in a 28-day cycles.\n\nPatients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, and for response every 8 (+/-1) weeks by RECIST 1.1\n\nTreatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.",

      "brief_summary": "Over 5 million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year, more than all other cancers combined. Most of these cases are caused by excess exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and artificial sources such as indoor tanning. Melanoma, approximately 87,000 of the annual skin cancer cases and one of the more deadly skin cancers, is on the rise. Previous research on these individuals suggests that while some change how much time they spend in the sun and adopt ways to protect themselves when in the sun, many do not. In our previous study, we found that 20% of melanoma survivors reported a sunburn in the past year and 10% intentionally went outside for a tan, both strong indicators of inappropriate sun exposure. Melanoma survivors are at high risk of second melanomas, making it critical that they spend less time in the sun or take actions to protect themselves when they are in the sun.\n\nNo studies to date have investigated technology-based strategies in melanoma survivors to improve sun exposure and protection behaviors. This project will test whether a wearable device that tracks sun exposure and provides alerts regarding sun exposure and protection behaviors will increase sun protection behaviors in melanoma survivors. The use of wearable technology devices (e.g., Fitbit) has grown quickly over the last decade and studies using these devices to promote physical activity and weight loss have been promising. We will test the technology device versus a similar control device in 368 melanoma survivors and compare sun protection behaviors between the two groups.\n\nThis project has the potential to identify a strategy that could significantly lower the number of melanoma survivors who go on to have a second melanoma diagnosis. Importantly, this easy to use technology could also be utilized by survivors' family members, who are also at higher risk for melanoma, and the general population as a means to reduce risk of all forms of skin cancer.",

      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to reduce melanoma mortality by improving early detection of melanoma with skin self-examination (SSE) among people who self-identify as being at risk and seek care for a concerning mole. Because women are more likely than men to perform SSE, women who are engaged in health promotion by having a recent screening mammogram are the focus of this research. Self-management of melanoma detection with SSE depends on ready access to dermatologists when a concerning mole is detected. In March 2020, the Illinois stay at home order (COVID-19) prohibited non-essential health care, including screening mammography and dermatology office-based care, and both are expected to remain limited until fall 2020. This submission explores a) the effectiveness of targeted melanoma detection (TMD) among women, who identify their risk of having a melanoma, learn to perform SSE, and perform SSE, and b) the effectiveness of adhesive patch-based home sample collection for genomic analysis to rule out melanoma in moles identified by women (who received the intervention) as concerning will be explored.",

The effect of TMD with SSE education will be assessed with a randomized control trial among women served by Northwestern Medicine in rural, suburban and metropolitan communities. Women who identify concerning moles will choose among three options: a) watch the mole to see if the border, color or diameter of the mole changes b) send a picture of the mole to the PI for consideration of mole self-sampling, or c) make an appointment with my healthcare provider to check the mole. As required a physician will supervise women, who will perform non-invasive mole self-sampling with non-invasive adhesive patches for genomic analysis of the concerning pigmented lesion (mole). If the genomic analysis suggests that the concerning mole may be a melanoma, then the recommendation will be to have the mole biopsied.The effectiveness of acquired samples suggestive of melanoma will be examined by the obtaining the pathology reports of biopsied moles. Health care providers' (HCPs) clinical/pathologic assessment of concerning moles will be identified in the Northwestern Medicine electronic health record (EHR) system.",

The study will enroll at least 8 patients in the GEP-NET cohort and as many adolescents with PPGL as possible in the exploratory PPGL cohort.",
      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consists of the screening period (up to 2 weeks) followed by the treatment period (4 treatment administrations at 8-week interval), and the follow-up period (10 years).\n\nThe treatment period will consist of 4 Lutathera treatments administered at 8-week intervals. Lutathera administration will occur on Week 1 Day 1 of each cycle. Each patient will receive a total of 4 doses of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi). An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with each Lutathera dose for renal protection according to the approved Lutathera local prescribing information. An antiemetic will be administered prior to infusion of the AA solution for prevention of infusion-related nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe dosimetry and PK assessments will be performed during the first week after the 1st Lutathera dose, i.e. one time during the study treatment period for each patient. The dosimetry analysis will allow for estimation from the 1st Lutathera administration of the cumulative absorbed radiation dose from 4 Lutathera doses and also for taking a decision on the next dose levels. In the exceptional circumstances when dosimetry cannot be performed in a particular patient after the first Lutathera dose, it should be completed as soon as feasible upon a later dose. In order to minimize risk for each study subject, an accelerated analysis of dosimetry and safety data will be performed for each patient in the study, to enable the Investigator to take a decision for the subsequent Lutathera doses. The results of dosimetry assessments (imaging and blood dosimetry) will be provided to the investigators for their evaluation prior to administration of subsequent therapeutic cycles in each patient.\n\nA total follow-up period of 10 years (120 months) after the last Lutathera dose will take place for each patient who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This follow-up period will be comprised of a short-term follow-up of 6 months to evaluate cumulative Lutathera toxicities, followed by a long-term follow up of another 114 months.\n\nAn external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also operate in the study to evaluate accumulating safety and dosimetry data, to ensure the safety of adolescents enrolled in the study, and to provide recommendations to investigators as well as to the clinical team in charge of conducting the study.",
