      "eligibility_criteria": "Main Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) (2009) Stage IV cutaneous melanoma or Stage III cutaneous, acral or mucosal melanoma that is judged inoperable. Patients with a history of uveal melanoma are not eligible.\n2. Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as \\>20 mm with conventional techniques or as \\>10 mm with computerized tomography (CT) scan. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and a separate lesion amenable to biopsy.\n3. Histologic proof of melanoma reviewed and confirmed by the enrolling site.\n4. Previous treatment with a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor with documented progression of disease on most recent CT scan.

      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n- GI-6207 is an experimental cancer vaccine made with baker's yeast. The yeast has been modified to help the immune system target a protein called CEA. CEA is found on the surface of some kinds of tumor cells, including thyroid cancer cells. Researchers want to see if GI-6207 can encourage the body's immune system to attack and kill tumor cells that contain the CEA protein. They will test to see whether this vaccine is a safe and effective treatment for medullary thyroid cancer that has not responded to earlier treatments.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test the safety and effectiveness of the GI-6207 vaccine for advanced medullary thyroid cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have medullary thyroid cancer that has not responded to earlier treatments.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will provide blood and tumor samples and have an imaging study of the neck and chest. They will also have a skin test to make sure that they are not allergic to the yeast in the vaccine.\n* Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will start to take GI-6207 immediately for 1 year. The second group will have 6 months of monitoring and tests with no vaccine, and then will take GI-6207 for 1 year.\n* GI-6207 will be given every other week for the first seven visits (about 3 months), and then monthly for the remaining year of treatment. It will be given as injections beneath the arm and in the upper thigh. These locations will help the vaccine enter the lymph nodes and reach the immune system more quickly.\n* Participants will be monitored with frequent blood and urine tests and imaging studies.\n* Participants will have regular follow-up visits after their year of study vaccines.",
      "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND:\n\n* CEA is overexpressed in multiple malignancies, including medullary thyroid cancer where CEA is universally expressed on tumor cells.\n* There is no standard treatment for patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer. The only effective FDA-approved therapy (vandetanib) comes with significant toxicity, so it is not used until patients have symptomatic or rapidly progressing disease.\n* Preclinical studies have shown that GI-6207 can induce a strong immune response to CEA as well as therapeutic anti-tumor responses.\n* A previous Phase I GI-6207 study has demonstrated safety and enhanced immune response in some patients.\n* Preliminary data suggests that tumor growth rates can be calculated in medullary thyroid cancer patients within 3 months\n* Retrospective data from prostate cancer studies suggest that vaccines can alter tumor growth rates within 3-4 months\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary:\n\n-To determine the effect of GI-6207 on calcitonin growth rate kinetics after 6 months of therapy in patients with medullary thyroid cancer\n\nELIGIBILITY:\n\n* Patients will have evidence of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer including disease that is evaluable on bone or CT scan.\n* Patients with minimal or no disease related-symptoms (minimal symptoms will include those that do not affect activities of daily living or pain that does not require regularly schedule narcotics.)\n* ECOG 0-1\n* No previous chemotherapy\n* No previous vandetanib\n* Should have no autoimmune diseases; no evidence of being immunocompromised; no serious inter-current medical illness; no cardiac disease; no prior splenectomy.

(For patients randomized to surveillance and then GI-6207, they will get a full year of GI-6207 after a 6 month surveillance period.)\n* Once patients have completed one year of therapy with GI-6207, patients without radiographic progression will have the option to receive vaccine every 3 months for an additional 12 months. Patients who remain on vaccine will continue to be scanned every 3 months.\n* Immune monitoring via apheresis will be done prior to enrollment and at 6 months for all appropriate and consenting patients. Patients who are evaluable for immunologic response by the ELISPOT Assay (HLA 02, 03 and 24) will have apheresis at start of GI-6207 therapy and then every 3 months while on GI-6207 treatment when feasible.",

      "brief_summary": "The present study has 5 parts. In Parts A and A1, the dose of intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab (MK-3475) will be escalated from 1 to 10 mg/kg to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for participants with a histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of any type of carcinoma or melanoma (MEL) by evaluating the Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs). Following completion of the dose escalation, additional patients will be enrolled in Part A2 to further define pharmacokinetic characteristics. Part B of the study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) in participants with advanced or metastatic MEL and compare every 2 week dosing (Q2W) to every 3 week dosing (Q3W). Part C of the study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pembrolizumab administered at 10 mg/kg Q3W in participants with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that is locally advanced or metastatic. Part D of the study will investigate the low and high doses of study drug identified in Parts A and B (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) administered Q3W in participants with advanced or metastatic MEL. Part E (closed with Amendment 7) was planned to investigate low, medium, and high doses of pembrolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy in participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Part F will investigate low and high doses of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) administered Q2W or Q3W in treatment-naive and previously-treated participants with NSCLC with programmed cell death 1 ligand (PD-L1) gene expression. The primary hypotheses are the following: that pembrolizumab will have acceptable safety and tolerability; that pembrolizumab will show a clinically meaningful response rate (RR) or disease-control rate (DCR) in participants with melanoma (ipilimumab-refractory or not) and NSCLC, and that pembrolizumab will show a more clinically meaningful RR in participants with either cancer whose tumors express PD-L1.",

      "phase": "NA",
      "condition": "Lung Cancer",
      "intervention": "Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SABR)",
      "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical research study is to evaluate the outcome of a standard radiation treatment called stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) for NSCLC.\n\nSpecifically, researchers want to learn if standard SRT has as good of an outcome at 3 years after the procedure. The safety of the study treatment will also be analyzed.",
      "detailed_description": "The Study Treatment:\n\nThe treatment being used in this study is considered standard, but researchers want to see its outcome in early-stage NSCLC.\n\nThe radiation (SRT) in this study is designed to kill tumor cells by using beams of radiation aimed directly at the tumor from different angles. The doctor uses computed tomography (CT) scans to plan exactly where to direct the beams to go. A computer is used to show the location, size, and shape of the tumor. SRT is designed to cause less damage to normal tissue than surgery, and it also may allow a higher dose of radiation to be given to the tumor than if other forms of radiation therapy were used.\n\nThe SRT in this study will be performed using a radiation machine called Linear Accelerator (Linac).\n\nStudy Group:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive SRT (as an out-patient) once a day for 3-4 days in a row. You will be asked to hold still during the entire treatment (for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours each time). The machine will move around you, but you will not see or feel anything (similar to getting an x-ray).\n\nFollow-Up Visits:\n\nDuring the treatment period, you will be seen by a doctor and/or research nurse in order to check for any side effects. A physical exam will be performed, and your medical history will be recorded. These follow-up procedures will be done once on any day of your SRT.\n\nA physical exam will be performed and your medical history will be recorded at 6 and 12 months, then at 1 1/2, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after your SRT. If the doctor decides it is necessary, you will have a chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.\n\nAt 6 to 12 months after SRT, you will have either a PET-CT scan or CT scan to check the status of the disease.\n\nAt 1 year after SRT, you will have breathing tests to check your lung function. You will also have a CT scan to check the status of your disease.\n\nAt 1 1/2 year and then at 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after SRT, you will have a CT scan to check the status of your disease.\n\nPossible Re-Treatment On Study:\n\nIf one of your follow-up CT scans shows that the tumor has come back in the same location or very close, you will have a PET scan and a tumor biopsy. The purpose is to confirm the status of the disease. To collect a tumor biopsy, the affected area is numbed with anesthetic, and a small amount of tissue is withdrawn through a large needle.\n\nAs soon as the results of the scan and biopsy come back, the study doctor will discuss with you the different treatment options. You may receive surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, depending on the status of the disease. You will receive a separate consent form that describes the treatment in more detail, as well as the risks.\n\nAfter this \"re-treatment\", you will stay on the same schedule for study follow-up visits as you were following before.\n\nLength of Study Participation:\n\nYour participation in this study will be over after the 5-year follow-up visit.\n\nThis is an investigational study. The treatment is commercially available and considered standard for early-stage NSCLC. This includes the use of the Linac radiation machine, which is FDA approved and commercially available.\n\nUp to 80 treated patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Histological confirmation of non-small cell cancer will be required by either biopsy or cytology. The following primary cancer types are eligible: squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma with or without BAC features, large cell carcinoma with or without neuroendocrine features, neuroendocrine carcinoma, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, or non-small cell carcinoma not otherwise specified.\n2. Eligible patients must have appropriate staging studies identifying them as specific subsets of the revised IASLC stage IA based on the following combination of TNM staging: T1a,N0,M0 or T1b,N0,M0\n3. A PET/CT scan is required. Patients with hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes with short axis diameter \\</= 1cm and no abnormal hilar or mediastinal uptake on PET will be considered N0. Patients with \\> 1 cm short axis diameter of hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on CT or abnormal PET (including suspicious but non-diagnostic uptake) may still be eligible if directed tissue biopsy of all abnormally identified areas are negative for cancer. Solitary pulmonary lesions \\</= 6mm will not be considered significant.\n4. Patients must be considered a candidate for surgical resection of the primary tumor. Standard justification for deeming a patient medically operable based on pulmonary function for surgical resection of NSCLC may include any of the following: Baseline FEV1 \\> 40% predicted, post-operative predicted FEV1 \\> 30% predicted, diffusion capacity \\> 40% predicted, absent baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia, exercise oxygen consumption \\> 50% predicted, absent severe pulmonary hypertension, absent severe cerebral, cardiac, or peripheral vascular disease, and absent severe chronic heart disease.\n5. Patients must be \\>/= 18 years of age.\n6. The patient's Zubrod performance status must be Zubrod 0-2.\n7. PET/CT scan to include both lungs, the mediastinum, and adrenal glands; Primary tumor dimension will be measured on diagnostic CT and again on simulation CT. Must be done within 10 weeks prior to study entry.\n8. Mediastinoscopy or endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided biopsy of mediastinal lymph nodes is required for all patients. Must be done within 10 weeks of study entry.\n9. MRI or CT scans of Brain if there are symptoms or signs suggesting brain metastases, must be done within 10 weeks prior to study entry.\n10. Invasive Mediastinal Staging - All patients with CT and/or PET evidence of hilar (level 10) or mediastinal lymph nodes \\> 1.0 cm in the shortest diameter must be staged by either cervical mediastinoscopy, esophageal endoscopic ultrasound guided biopsy, or endobronchial ultrasound guided biopsy.\n11. Patients must sign a study-specific consent form.\n12. Patients (men and women) of child bearing potential should use an effective (for them) method of birth control throughout their participation in this study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with primary tumors \\> 3 cm.\n2. Patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (carcinoid tumor).\n3. Direct evidence of regional or distant metastases after appropriate staging studies, or synchronous primary or prior malignancy in the past 3 years other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer or in situ cancer.\n4. Previous lung or mediastinal radiotherapy.\n5. Plans for the patient to receive other concomitant local therapy (including standard fractionated radiotherapy and surgery) while on this protocol except at disease progression.\n6. Pregnant or lactating women, as treatment involves unforeseeable risks to the embryo or fetus.\n7. Cannot achieve acceptable SABR planning to meet minimal requirement of target coverage and dose-volume constraints of critical structures (see RT techniques).",

      "detailed_description": "This study was designed as a phase III, multi-center study consisting of 3 parts:\n\n* Part 1: Safety run-in part The safety run-in part aimed to determine the recommended regimen of PDR001 in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib for previously untreated patients with BRAF V600 mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma (stage IIIC/IV). Spartalizumab was administered at a starting dose level (DL1) of 400 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W), along with fixed doses of dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg once daily). The RP3R for Part 3 was determined using the Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) with escalation with overdose control (EWOC) criteria.\n* Part 2: Biomarker cohort Part 2 was run to explore changes in the immune microenvironment and biomarker modulations upon treatment with the combination of dabrafenib, trametinib and PDR001. Part 2 started when the fourth subject in dose level 1 (DL1) of Part 1 completed approximately 4 weeks of study treatment, and fewer than 3 dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed. Participants in Part 2 received PDR001 (spartalizumab) at a dosage of 400 mg Q4W, in combination with dabrafenib (150 mg BID) and trametinib (2 mg QD).\n* Part 3: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled part Part 3 was comparing the efficacy and safety of spartalizumab in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib to placebo in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib. Part 3 was initiated after determining the RP3R for the combination of spartalizumab with dabrafenib and trametinib in Part 1. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the RP3R dose of spartalizumab identified in Part 1 or placebo, along with dabrafenib (150 mg BID) and trametinib (2 mg QD).\n\nFor all parts of the study, the treatment continued until the subject experiences any of the following events: disease progression according to RECIST 1.1 as determined by the Investigator, unacceptable toxicity, initiation of a new anti-neoplastic therapy, pregnancy, withdrawal of consent, physician's decision, loss to follow-up, death, or termination of the study by the Sponsor. Safety evaluations are conducted for all subjects for up to 150 days after the last dose of spartalizumab/placebo (safety follow-up period).\n\nSubjects who discontinued study treatment without disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 continued with tumor assessments according to the protocol until documented disease progression, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or death, regardless of the initiation of new anti-neoplastic therapy (efficacy follow-up period).\n\nSubjects entered the survival follow-up period after completing the safety follow-up period or experiencing disease progression as per RECIST 1.1 or response criteria for immunotherapy, whichever period is longer (survival follow-up period).",

      "brief_summary": "Current therapeutic approaches available for patients with advanced-stage melanoma remain inadequate, and existing approaches including those involving immunotherapy with cytokines and/or targeted strategies have resulted in disappointingly low rates of durable and complete responses. Correcting immune dysfunction in advanced-stage melanoma patients using tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib is proposed to relicense the patient's immune system to respond optimally to specific immunization. The integration of antigens expressed by tumor-associated blood vessel cells provides a means to selectively target the genetically-/antigenically-heterogeneous population of tumor cells in the advanced-stage melanoma patient.\n\nThis is a single-center, prospective randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the activity, safety and immune effects of dasatinib given in combination with an autologous type-1 polarized Dendritic Cell (αDC1) vaccine. The current trial represents a randomized Phase 2 study to determine the activity and safety of intradermal (id) administration of αDC1s loaded with a mixture of six TBVA-derived peptides at the time of, or immediately after, an initial therapy cycle with the TKI dasatinib.\n\nDasatinib will be administered at the standard dose and schedule recommended by the FDA (70 mg BID). The autologous type-I DC vaccine will be administered either prior to, or concomitant with, the initiation of dasatinib administration. All patients will receive dasatinib at a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily by mouth in the outpatient setting approximately every 12 hours, at the same time each day.\n\nThe DC vaccine will be administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10e7 cells, with all the DCs being administered on days 1 and 15 of every cycle on an outpatient basis in the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Research Center (UPCI-CTRC).\n\nPatients on Arm A will start dasatinib administration on cycle 2, day 1 (week 5), while those patients in Arm B will start dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (week 1).\n\nMen and women at least 18 years of age must be HLA-A2+ and have histologically confirmed melanoma that is metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable Stage IIIB/C and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.\n\nNote: The outcome measures and time frames (previously) described in the PRS protocol record have been revised and articulated in the results section, to more accurately describe and represent the stated per-protocol investigations and endpoints, quantitatively.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase III trial studies cabozantinib to see how well it works compared with placebo in treating patients with neuroendocrine or carcinoid tumors that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Cabozantinib is a chemotherapy drug known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and it targets specific tyrosine kinase receptors, that when blocked, may slow tumor growth.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether cabozantinib (cabozantinib S-malate) can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nIII. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).\n\nIV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors using CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE.\n\nV. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nVI. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nOTHER OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Results of the primary analysis will be examined for consistency, while taking into account the stratification factors and/or covariates of baseline quality of life (QOL) and fatigue.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare overall quality of life, disease-related symptoms, and other domains between the two treatment groups (cabozantinib versus \\[vs.\\] placebo) within each cohort of patients (pancreatic NET vs. carcinoid tumor). (Quality of Life Substudy Objective - A021602-HO1)\n\nPOPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To describe the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response relationships of cabozantinib in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors. (Population Pharmacokinetics Substudy Objective - A021602-PP1)\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and CT, MRI, and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study. Patients may crossover to receive cabozantinib S-malate at the time of disease progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks until disease progression or start of new anticancer therapy, and then every 6 months until 8 years after registration.",

      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "phase": "PHASE2",
      "condition": "Melanoma (Skin)",
      "intervention": "bevacizumab; carboplatin; everolimus; paclitaxel",
      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial is studying how well carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab work when given with or without everolimus in treating patients with malignant melanoma that has spread from where it started to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy given together with bevacizumab is more effective with or without everolimus in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.",
      "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\n* To assess whether there is sufficient promise of an impact of the addition of everolimus to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab on progression-free survival that it would be recommended for further testing in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.\n\nSecondary\n\n* To estimate the confirmed tumor response rate of each of the treatment regimens.\n* To estimate the distribution of overall survival (OS) time for each of the treatment regimens.\n* To assess the impact on the safety profile of the addition of everolimus to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to elevated LDH (above upper limit of normal) at baseline (yes vs no), location of metastatic disease (M1a \\[skin, subcutaneous tissue, or lymph node only\\] vs M1b \\[lung\\] vs M1c \\[other visceral sites\\]) and prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in Arm I. Patients also receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) 3 times weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well liposomal irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil work in treating patients with high grade neuroendocrine cancer of gastrointestinal, unknown, or pancreatic origin that does not respond to treatment and has spread to other places in the body. Lliposomal irinotecan may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and leucovorin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving liposomal irinotecan, leucovorin and fluorouracil may work better in treating patients with neuroendocrine cancer.",

To determine the objective response rate liposomal irinotecan (nanoliposomal irinotecan \\[Nal-IRI\\]) + fluorouracil (5FU) and leucovorin in patients with refractory advanced high grade neuroendocrine cancer of gastrointestinal (GI), unknown or pancreatic origin.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine overall survival, progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, safety, clinical response and, quality of life (QOL) changes resulting from the combination treatment of nanoliposomal irinotecan (Nal-IRI) + fluorouracil (5FU) and leucovorin.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Genetic profiling for mutations will be conducted on all pre-study tumor samples and compared to changes in immune response.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive liposomal irinotecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes, leucovorin IV over 30 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 46 hours on days 1 and 15.

      "brief_summary": "This was a multicenter, stratified, open, randomized, comparator-controlled, parallel-group phase III study comparing treatment with Lutathera plus best supportive care (30 mg Octreotide LAR) to treatment with high dose (60 mg) Octreotide LAR in participants with metastasized or locally advanced, inoperable, somatostatin receptor positive, histologically proven midgut carcinoid tumours with progression despite LAR treatment.",
      "detailed_description": "After the screening period, participants who signed the ICF and were eligible for the study in accordance with the entry criteria were randomly assigned to treatment either Lutathera or Octreotide LAR. Participant randomization was performed according to a centralized permuted block randomization scheme with a balanced ratio (1:1) between the 2 treatment groups, stratified by tumor uptake score and by the length of time that a participant was on a constant dose of Octreotide (=\\< 6 versus \\> 6 months).\n\nObjective tumor assessment in both groups was performed every 12+/-1 weeks from the randomization date according to RECIST Criteria until progression was centrally confirmed:\n\n1. Any participants with progressive disease (confirmed by central review of CT/MRI scans) ceased the treatment/assessment period and proceeded to the long-term follow-up period for evaluation of survival and long-term safety.\n2. All non-progressive participants continued treatment/assessments until the PFS primary endpoint was met (i.e. 74 evaluable and centrally confirmed disease progressions or death events). Once the Primary End-Point was reached:\n\n   1. Participants who received more than 76 weeks of treatment/assessment, stopped the study treatment (however somatostatin analogues could be received as subsequent treatment as per Investigator's discretion) but continued the long-term follow-up assessment for 5 years overall from the date of randomization of the last participant randomized.\n   2. The remaining randomized participants continued in the fixed 76-week treatment/assessment period unless progression occurred, then continued the long-term follow-up assessments for 5 years overall from the date of randomization of the last participant.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Presence of metastasized or locally advanced, inoperable (curative intent) at enrollment time, histologically proven, midgut carcinoid tumour (to be centrally confirmed).\n2. Ki67 index ≤ 20% (to be centrally confirmed).\n3. Patients on Octreotide LAR at a fixed dose of 20 mg or 30 mg at 3-4 weeks intervals for at least 12 weeks prior to randomization in the study.\n4. Patients ≥18 years of age.\n5. Patients must have progressive disease based on RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1 while receiving an uninterrupted fixed dose of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks). Disease progression must be centrally confirmed. In order to make the assessment, two CT (or MRI) scans are required. The oldest scan must not be older than 3 years from the date of randomization. The most recent scan must not be older than 4 weeks from the date of randomization. Both scans must be obtained while the patient is receiving the same fixed dose of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks) with the following exceptions; 1) it is acceptable if the oldest scan is obtained within 12 weeks of the patient receiving a fixed dose regimen of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks); AND 2) it is acceptable for either scan to be obtained before or during the time a patient receiving a fixed dose of Octreotide LAR has switched to an equivalent dose of short acting Octreotide for up to 6 weeks in order to obtain an OctreoScan®, provided the patient returns to the Octreotide LAR fixed dose after the OctreoScan® has been obtained.\n6. Confirmed presence of somatostatin receptors on all target lesions (for target/non-target/measurable lesions definition see §Appendix 2, Section 1 and 2, RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1) documented by CT/MRI scans, based on positive OctreoScan® imaging within 24 weeks prior to randomization in the study (to be centrally confirmed). The OctreoScan® should be one that was performed while the patient was on a fixed dose of Octreotide LAR. If a patient has had an OctreoScan® performed while Octreotide LAR treatment-naïve, the patient must have a repeat OctreoScan® performed after 3 months of Octreotide LAR treatments before entering the clinical study to prove that the index lesions or new lesions still meet the criteria for inclusion. It is acceptable to have patients temporarily switched to Octreotide s.c. (up to six weeks) in order to obtain an OctreoScan®, provided they return to the same fixed dose of Octreotide LAR prior to the scan.\n7. The tumour uptake observed in each target lesion (for target/non-target/measurable lesions definition see §Appendix 2, Sections 1 and 2, RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1) using OctreoScan® must be ≥ normal liver uptake observed on planar imaging (to be centrally confirmed) (§Appendices 5 and 6).\n8.

The primary hypothesis (Parts 1 and 2) is that Pembro+D+T is sufficiently well-tolerated to permit clinical investigation.\n\nPart 3 is a double-blind study of Pembro+D+T versus placebo+D+T. The primary study hypothesis (Part 3 only) is that the Pembro+D+T improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo+D+T.\n\nPart 4 is nonrandomized and open-label and is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability and identify the MTD or MAD of Pembro+T in participants who have v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 \\[BRAF\\] mutation-negative (without V600 E or K) melanoma or solid tumors \\[irrespective of BRAF status\\]. The primary hypothesis (Part 4) is that Pembro+T is sufficiently well-tolerated to permit clinical investigation.\n\nPart 5 will confirm the dose(s) identified in Part 4 in participants BRAF wild type \\[without V600E or K\\] melanoma or solid tumors \\[irrespective of BRAF status\\] and will further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy (Objective Response Rate \\[ORR\\]) of Pembro+T in participants who have BRAF wild type \\[without V600E or K\\] melanoma or solid tumors \\[irrespective of BRAF status\\]. The primary hypotheses (Part 5) are that Pembro+T is sufficiently well-tolerated at the MTD/MAD to permit further clinical investigation and is effective in attaining objective responses based upon Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by Investigator review in participants who have melanoma without BRAF V600 E or K mutations. With Amendment 5 (21-Mar-2019), the Part 5 expansion cohort will not be pursued following the completion of Part 5 dose confirmation.\n\nParts 1 and 2 of the study may also explore, if needed based on tolerability, the backup combinations of open-label Pembro+T (for BRAF mutation-negative participants) or Pembro+D (for BRAF mutation-positive participants). These will run concurrently with the Pembro+D+T arm.",

      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nThere is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.\n\nLCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015 World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.\n\nLCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.\n\nBased on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).\n\nSimilarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.\n\nTreatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent, driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors.

      "detailed_description": "Arginase-1 (ARG1) is an enzyme that converts the amino acid arginine into urea and ornithine. ARG1 is mainly expressed in hepatocytes but different myeloid cells are also capable of ARG1-expression.\n\nAn ARG1-induced arginine depletion suppresses T cell function through the impairment of the T cell receptor (TCR)-complex. A research group from the Center for Cancer Immune Therapy (CCIT) have identified spontaneous T cell reactivity against ARG1 peptides in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of cancer patients and healthy donors. The theoretic background for an ARG1 peptide vaccine is to activate ARG1-specific T cells to infiltrate the tumor microenvironment and eliminate ARG1-expressing immunosuppressive cells. The aim is to treat 10 patients with progressive solid tumors following treatment with standard of care agents. Patients will receive ARG1 vaccinations administered subcutaneously every third week for 45 weeks.\n\nThe primary endpoint is to evaluate safety and toxicity. Immune responses will be assessed using blood- and tumor tissue samples and clinical responses are evaluated using RECIST 1.1.",

      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion criteria\n\n1. Subjects must have recurrent stage III (i.e., recurrent regional metastasis), or stage IV (i.e., any distant metastasis) melanoma for which surgical resection would be clinically recommended, with biopsy proven (current or previous) Stage III or Stage IV disease. Any biopsies obtained to demonstrate recurrent regional metastasis or distant metastasis must be considered clinically appropriate for clinical management and must not be performed solely for meeting eligibility criteria. In addition, subjects must have disease that has not yet been completely excised.\n2. Patients must have disease which involves 3 or fewer sites.

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without cediranib works in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib and cediranib may help treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",

To evaluate association of homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair deficiency (HRD) with the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib or olaparib monotherapy, as measured by rPFS, in mCRPC patients.\n\nIII. To evaluate the safety the combination of cediranib and olaparib and olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing in mCRPC patients and correlate that with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nII. To characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes, angiogenesis markers, and immune markers, by whole transcriptome sequencing and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIII.

      "detailed_description": "Patients are being asked to take part in this clinical research study because they have stage IIIB, IIIC or IIID cutaneous (or unknown primary) melanoma with lymph node disease and have yet to undergo surgery. There are two phases, Prime Phase and a Boost Phase. If they participate they will receive nivolumab in combination with CMP-001 for a total of 7 weeks (Prime Phase) prior to surgery. Surgery will be performed approximately 2-4 weeks after completion of the Prime Phase. After recovery from surgery patients will receive additional nivolumab in combination with CMP-001 for approximately 46 additional weeks (Boost Phase).\n\nThe main goal of this research study to determine if the combination of nivolumab and CMP-001 improves the likelihood of eradicating (destroying) disease in the lymph node (pathologic response rate). Pathologic responses are associated with improved relapse-free and overall survival in melanoma.\n\nPrior to surgery (Prime Phase) Nivolumab 240mg, will be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on an outpatient basis. During the Prime Phase, 3 cycles of Nivolumab will be administered every 2 weeks over a 6 week period starting with cycle 2, cycle 4 and then cycle 6.\n\nPrior to surgery (Prime Phase) CMP-001 will be given as an injection from a syringe weekly for a total of 7 weeks. The first injection (week 1), 5mg, will be applied directly into the skin and the remaining injections, 10mg will be administered, will be given intra-tumorally for weeks 2-7.\n\nSurgery will be performed to the cancerous lymph node 2-4 weeks after the Prime Phase is completed.\n\nAfter recovery from surgery (Boost Phase) Nivolumab will be administered at 240mg every 2 weeks or 480 mg every 4 weeks depending on the physician's preference. CMP-001, 5mg, will be administered by injections intra-tumorally every 4 weeks for up to 54 weeks.\n\nPatients will be followed to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. This will be done every 3 months.",

Participants in Part 1 will receive either pembrolizumab or placebo in a double-blind design every 3 weeks (Q3W) for up to 17 cycles/\\~1 year (each cycle = 21 days). Participants who complete the initial treatment of 17 cycles of pembrolizumab in Part 1 and experience disease recurrence may be eligible for re-challenge with pembrolizumab at the same dose and schedule of 200 mg Q3W (21-day cycles) for up to 35 cycles (up to \\~2 years) in Part 2 in an open label design. Participants who complete the initial treatment of placebo and experience disease recurrence may be eligible to switch over to pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W (21-day cycles) for up to 35 cycles (up to \\~2 years) in Part 2 in an open label design. The primary hypothesis of this study is that pembrolizumab increases recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to placebo.\n\nPer protocol, response/ progression or adverse events (AEs) during re-challenge/switch-over in Part 2 will not be counted towards the RFS outcome measure or safety outcome measures respectively.",

      "brief_summary": "This study is a Phase I study of oncolytic polio/rhinovirus recombinant (PVSRIPO) to primarily characterize the safety and tolerability of PVSRIPO in patients with AJCC Stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma in a modified 3+3 phase 1 trial design. Lesion biopsies and blood samples will be obtained pre- and post-injection throughout the study for routine histology/molecular genetic testing and immunologic analysis, respectively. Exploratory objectives include describing the response rates of PVSRIPO-injected versus non-injected lesion(s), the number of CD8 positive T cells present in the tumor biopsies before and after injection of PVSRIPO, and after PVSRIPO administration: the pathologic response in tumor biopsies, changes in the tumor microenvironment, and how systemic immune cell populations may change.",
      "detailed_description": "The Primary Objective of the study is to determine the safety profile of PVSRIPO in Stage IIIB, IIIC, and IV recurrent melanoma patients as determined by dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) by cohort, as well as in those retreated with PVSRIPO, when PVSRIPO is injected intralesionally into 1 to 3 or more cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions. As planned, up to 18 patients may be treated with PVSRIPO.\n\nBiopsy material will be obtained from tumor tissue prior to and following virus administration, which may be subjected to routine histology along with molecular genetic testing and evaluation of pathological response. Whole blood for immunologic analyses will also be collected throughout the study period.\n\nRoutine study visits will occur through Day 126. Thereafter, visits will occur every 2-3 months for up to 2 years for subjects who do not progress. For patients with progressive disease, chart review only will occur every 3 months starting at the time of progression.\n\nPatients who previously participated in Cohorts 0 through 3, who in the opinion of the investigator, may benefit from continued PVSRIPO administration, may be eligible to receive additional injections.",

After TIL infusion, patients are treated with IL-2 to support T cell activation and expansion in vivo.\n\nThe BRAF inhibitor is an approved treatment of metastatic melanoma and functions by selectively inhibiting the BRAF mutated enzyme, consequently halting the proliferation of tumor cells. Furthermore, in vitro tests have shown that vemurafenib has immunomodulatory effects that are hypothesized to synergize with TIL therapy, which has been confirmed in animal studies.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To evaluate safety and feasibility when combining vemurafenib and ACT with TILs.\n* To evaluate treatment related immune responses\n* To evaluate clinical efficacy\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, blood samples and ECG.\n* Patients will start vemurafenib 960 mg BID and will continue during TIL preparation.\n* 7 days after start of vemurafenib, patients will undergo surgery to harvest tumor material for TIL production.\n* Patient stops vemurafenib and is admitted day -8 in order to undergo lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludara starting day -7.\n* On day 0 patients receive TIL infusion and shortly after starts IL-2 infusion continually following the decrescendo regimen.\n* The patients will followed until progression or up to 5 years.",

      "detailed_description": "This is a phase II Simon two-stage single-center study of concurrent fecal microbiota transplang (FMT) with pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1 resistant/refractory melanoma. The study will be conducted over a 12-week period (and up to 24-weeks in responding patients).\n\nPatient eligibility is based upon prior exposure to PD-1 inhibitor therapy and response at first (or subsequent) restaging scans from week 12 up to week 52. Patients must have received a minimum of 2 cycles to be considered eligible. Patients who have received either nivolumab or pembrolizumab are eligible. Patients who have received pembrolizumab/nivolumab in combination with other investigational agent(s) may be eligible at the discretion of the treating investigator. PD-1 refractory disease is defined as progressive disease (PD) at the first (or subsequent) radiographic evaluation while receiving PD-1 inhibitor treatment as assessed by RECIST v1.1 on a restaging scan. Other eligibility criteria include absence of CNS disease, presence of disease amenable to biopsy and lack of contra-indications to FMT administration. Patients will be stratified on the presence or absence of liver metastases.\n\nSuitable patients will be identified following first (or subsequent) restaging study that documents progressive disease (RECIST v1.1). Patients will undergo a screening evaluation consisting of imaging (including CNS if clinically suspected), tumor biopsy, and serological/stool studies to confirm suitability for FMT administration. Eligible patients will receive FMT endoscopically (along with intestinal biopsy) (with cycle 1 pembrolizumab +/- 3 days) followed by 3 further cycles of pembrolizumab (cycles 2-4) following which restaging will be performed. Patients with stable and/or responding disease will continue to receive pembrolizumab on study for 4 cycles. Patients with stable and/or responding disease after 8 cycles of pembrolizumab will continue to receive therapy off study until disease progression or up to two years from FMT administration.",

      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) are tumours derived from enterochromaffin cells, which are characterised by the expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) on their surface. These tumours release substances into systemic circulation, resulting in episodic flushing, wheezing, diarrhoea, and eventual right-sided valvular heart disease. All of these symptoms negatively impact on patients' quality of life. The management of NET is primarily determined by the stage of disease. For patients with localised or limited disease the primary modality of therapy is surgery. Whilst patients with metastatic disease, undergo systemic therapy with palliative intent. Accurate imaging is therefore central to the management of this disease. Whilst computed tomography (CT) is useful in the localisation of NET, nuclear imaging using tumour-specific radiolabelled receptors are considerably more sensitive and specific methods for detecting NET and their metastases. The most commonly used positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers used for the visualisation of NET are radiolabelled somatostatin analogs (SSAs) labelled with \\[68Ga\\]Ga-DOTA-peptides. The \\[68Ga\\]Ga-DOTA-peptide radiolabelled SSAs have significant limitations in terms of accessibility and low throughput.

      "detailed_description": "Screening/Subject eligibility: Subjects with histologically confirmed cutaneous melanoma that was either unresectable or metastatic (Stages IIIC or IV), were screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects were BRAF V600E or V600K mutation positive. Subjects who had prior systemic anti-cancer treatment in the advanced or metastatic setting were not eligible although prior systemic treatment in the adjuvant setting was allowed.\n\nRandomization: A total of 704 subjects were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive combination therapy (352 subjects) or vemurafenib treatment (352 subjects). Subjects were stratified by LDH level (\\> the ULN versus =\\< ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K).\n\nStudy treatment: Dabrafenib and trametinib were administered orally at their recommended doses of 150 mg b.i.d. and 2.0 mg once daily, respectively. Subjects randomized in the combination therapy arm received both the agents. Subjects randomized in the vemurafenib arm received vemurafenib at the recommended dose of 960 mg orally b.i.d. Subjects in both the arms continued treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The protocol was amended on 07-Aug-2014 which allowed subjects who were still receiving vemurafenib to cross over to the dabrafenib and trametinib combination arm, including those subjects who were still receiving vemurafenib monotherapy treatment after disease progression. A washout period of a minimum of 7 days was considered prior to initiating dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Subjects who experienced disease progression on the vemurafenib monotherapy arm, discontinued vemurafenib monotherapy, and subsequently received another anticancer therapy were ineligible for cross over to the dabrafenib and trametinib combination arm.\n\nFollow-up/Study closure: After study treatment discontinuation, subjects were followed for survival and disease progression as applicable. This study completed once all the subjects had at least the 5-years of follow-up.",

      "intervention": "Ziv-aflibercept",
      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and schedule.\n\nYou will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each cycle is 28 days.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle: questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).\n\nUrine tests will be performed every other cycle.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.\n\nAfter the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed: questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test, EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of melanoma and other cancers. It is not yet known whether ipilimumab is more effective than interferon alfa-2b in treating patients with melanoma.",

      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients must have disease-free status documented by a complete physical examination and imaging studies within 4 weeks prior to randomization; imaging studies must include a total body positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) scan (with or without brain) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT (if MRI is contraindicated); if PET-CT cannot be done, CT of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be done\n\n  * If for some reason a CT cannot be done, an MRI may be done instead; any other imaging studies if performed (eg, bone scan) must show no evidence of disease\n* Patients must have primary cutaneous melanoma that belong to one of the following American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stages (2009 AJCC Melanoma Staging System):\n\n  * Stage IIIB\n\n    * T1-4b N1a M0\n    * T1-4b N2a M0\n    * T1-4b N1b M0\n    * T1-4b N2b M0\n    * T1-4b N2c M0\n  * Stage IIIC\n\n    * T1-4b N1b M0\n    * T1-4b N2b M0\n    * T1-4b N2c M0\n    * Any T N3 M0\n  * Stage IV\n\n    * M1a\n    * M1b\n    * NOTE: patients with stage IV melanoma must have normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and either distant skin, subcutaneous, lymph node, or lung metastases, but no other visceral metastases in order to be eligible; for patients with resected stage IV melanoma, LDH within the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) must be documented within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* Patients with disease recurrence after adequate surgical excision of the original primary cutaneous/unknown primary melanoma are allowed even if they don't fit the strict staging criteria, but only as follows:\n\n  * Recurrence in a regional lymph node basin after a prior complete lymph node dissection; relapsed disease must be completely surgically resected with free margins\n  * Recurrence in the form of in-transit or satellite metastases or distant skin/subcutaneous, nodal, or lung metastases that are completely surgically resected with free margins\n  * Recurrence in a regional lymph node basin; relapsed disease must be completely surgically resected with free margins\n* Patients with unknown primary melanoma (Tx) who present with cutaneous, subcutaneous, nodal and/or lung metastases that are completely surgically resected with free margins are allowed; these patients are allowed even if they don't fit the strict staging criteria; for stage IV patients LDH within the institutional ULN must be documented within 4 weeks prior to randomization (M1c is not eligible)\n\n  * NOTE: all subjects should be classified as IIIB, IIIC, M1a or M1b including subjects with disease recurrence after adequate surgical excision of the original primary melanoma; that is the treating team/physician investigator should review an overall TNM status (that includes primary tumor presentation and disease recurrence status) and provide a designation of IIIB, IIIC, M1a or M1b\n* Patients must be randomized within 84 days (12 weeks) of surgical resection; if more than one surgical procedure is required to render the patient disease-free, the patient must be randomized within 12 weeks of the last surgery\n\n  * NOTE: patients with clinically positive lymph nodes for melanoma involvement or those with positive lymph nodes identified through lymphoscintigraphic and/or dye lymphographic techniques in the groin, axilla, or neck should have additional lymphadenectomy in those sites; the complete lymph node dissection procedure would be considered as the last surgery in counting the 84 days unless a subsequent surgical procedure(s) was clinically required to ensure the disease free status\n* Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1\n* Given that serious adverse events may occur with ipilimumab and IFN-alpha and that these may impact a patient's wellbeing, it is possible that the occurrence of other serious adverse events (SAEs) may seriously impact an underlying state of mental depression and lead to suicidal ideation; therefore, patients should be carefully screened for depression at baseline and if there are indications or a history of depression it is strongly recommended that these patients be closely followed together with behavioral health or psychiatric medical support; patients with an established diagnosis of depression that, in the assessment of the investigator may make the administration of IFN-alpha or ipilimumab hazardous, should not be enrolled on this protocol; the risks and benefits of being treated with standard adjuvant IFN-alpha should be weighed very carefully in consultation with behavioral health or psychiatry\n* Due to the possible effect of treatment with ipilimumab on the immunologic response to infectious disease vaccines, patients must not have had any infectious disease vaccination (e.g., standard influenza, H1N1 influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal, tetanus toxoid) within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of ipilimumab or HDI, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized; women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential\n\n  * Men of fathering potential and WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid conception/pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of ipilimumab or HDI in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized; men or WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to strictly follow this requirement are not eligible\n  * WOCBP are not eligible if they satisfy any of the following:\n\n    * A positive pregnancy test at baseline\n    * Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* White blood cell (WBC) \\>= 3,000/uL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500/uL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Platelets \\>= 100 x 10\\^3/uL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 10 g/dL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Serum creatinine =\\< 1.5 mg/dL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =\\< 2.5 x ULN (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Serum bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x ULN, (except patients with Gilbert's syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL) (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* No active or chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C due to the unknown effects of ipilimumab; patients must have negative testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must not have received any adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, biotherapy, or limb perfusion) after the resection(s) that make(s) them eligible for this trial\n\n  * NOTE: previous radiation therapy, including after the surgical resection, is allowed as long as 21 days have elapsed between the radiation and initiation of this adjuvant systemic therapy\n* Prior treatment with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies or prior CTLA-4 inhibitor or agonist or prior clusters of differentiation (CD)137 agonist or prior interferon-alfa is not allowed; other forms of prior treatment for melanoma (e.g., aldesleukin \\[IL-2\\], anti-tumor vaccine, chemotherapy) are allowed if given before the resection(s) that make(s) the patient eligible for this trial, but these must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* Patients must not have an active infection requiring current treatment with parenteral antibiotics\n* Patients must not have other significant medical, surgical, or psychiatric conditions or require any medication or treatment that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with compliance, make the administration of ipilimumab or HDI hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events (AEs), such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea; patients with a baseline of frequent diarrhea (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome) are not eligible because of the difficulty in interpreting later expected GI toxicities that may lead to suboptimal management and complications\n* Patients must not have a documented history of inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) or diverticulitis (history of diverticulosis is allowed)\n* Patients must not have autoimmune disorders or conditions of immunosuppression that require current ongoing treatment with systemic corticosteroids (or other systemic immunosuppressants), including oral steroids (i.e., prednisone, dexamethasone) or continuous use of topical steroid creams or ointments or ophthalmologic steroids; a history of occasional (but not continuous) use of steroid inhalers is allowed; replacement doses of steroids for patients with adrenal insufficiency are allowed; patients who discontinue use of these classes of medication for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization are eligible if, in the judgment of the treating physician investigator, the patient is not likely to require resumption of treatment with these classes of drugs during the study\n\n  * Exclusion from this study also includes patients with a history of symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis \\[scleroderma\\], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune vasculitis \\[e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis\\]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis); other central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease (e.g., poliomyelitis, multiple sclerosis)\n  * Patients with autoimmune hypothyroid disease or type I diabetes on replacement treatment are eligible\n* Patients must not be prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness; this is due to concerns about subject safety and compliance with study procedures\n* Patients who have other current malignancies are not eligible; patients with other malignancies are eligible if they have been continuously disease free for \\> 5 years prior to the time of randomization; patients with prior history at any time of any in situ cancer, lobular carcinoma of the breast in situ, cervical cancer in situ, atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or melanoma in situ are eligible; patients with prior history of basal or squamous skin cancer are eligible; patients who have had multiple primary melanomas are eligible\n* Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to the unknown effects of ipilimumab and HDI on conception and the fetus; all females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study during screening to rule out pregnancy\n\n  * NOTE: a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months); post-menopause is defined as:\n\n    * Amenorrhea \\>= 12 consecutive months without another cause, or\n    * For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level \\>= 35 mIU/mL",

Investigators also want to learn if ONC201 can prevent new deposits of cancer from appearing in new places in participants (metastases). A phase 2 study of ONC201 in PC-PG (pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma) and other neuroendocrine tumors will determine whether inhibition of DRD2 (a member of the dopamine receptor family) is safe in unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, refractory, or metastatic neuroendocrine cancers including PC-PG, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), Ewing sarcoma (PNET) or any other neuroendicrine tumor with a catecholamine or dopamine biomarker or autocrine or paracrine dependence on dopamine including cholangiocarcinoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma.\n\nONC201 is an investigational (experimental) agent and has a favorable safety profile in phase 1 and early phase 2 clinical trials in advanced cancers. This study design has been chosen to see whether ONC201 is associated with reduction of anti-hypertension medications, safety and significant efficacy against neuroendocrine tumors, especially PC-PG.",
      "detailed_description": "Primary Objective To demonstrate objective responses using MRI or CT, and/or PET-CT imaging. The same CT or MRI imaging to assess disease burden at study entry will be compared at week 6 and 3 months. Patients without progression at 3 months will continue treatment and have imaging at 6, 9 and 12 months after study entry. Metabolic response and/or biomarkers will be compared with study entry PET-CT and scans at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months.\n\nSecondary Objectives Progression - free Survival: This will be calculated according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) or development of new disease\n\nOverall survival: Overall survival will be determined by email or telephone contact.\n\nStudy Design: Phase 2 open-label fixed dose study Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors including PC-PG are rare diseases.\n\nThe current recommended phase II dose of 625 mg orally on 2 consecutive days every week will be used. The same imaging at study entry will be used at subsequent time points (CT or MRI for week 6 and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) Imaging modality choice will be influenced by the quality of prior scans of the subject and will be ordered so clinical comparison is possible.\n\nBecause of travel and lodging considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, some information by the study team/PI may be obtained using virtual visits and 2nd read of scans sent to Cleveland Clinic",

CTCs have also been shown to be valuable as predictive markers following treatment and there is increasing interest in using CTCs as 'liquid biopsies' that can help to inform treatment decisions. CTC analysis has the benefit of being relatively non- invasive and quick compared with a conventional CT scan and is therefore an attractive method of monitoring the tumour throughout the treatment period.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the clinical value that enumeration will have in predicting the clinical symptomatic response and progression free survival in patients receiving Somatuline Autogel for functioning midgut NETs over a one year period.",

The cancer vaccine CDX-1401 attaches to a protein that is made in tumor cells. The vaccine helps the body recognize the tumor to fight the cancer. The biologic drug CDX-301 may help the body make more of the tumor fighting cells, known as dendritic cells. Another biologic drug, poly-ICLC, may stimulate the immune system and help these dendritic cells mature so that they can recognize the tumor. Giving CDX-301 may make the immune response to a combination of CDX-1401 and poly-ICLC better.",

To assess the effect of the vaccine regimen on immune responses to other ongoing and nascent antitumor response antigens associated with melanoma (e.g., PRAME, MAGE-A3, p53, and gp100) as well as memory viral responses (influenza A) and chronic viral responses (cytomegalovirus \\[CMV\\], Epstein-Barr virus \\[EBV\\]).\n\nII. To assess the effect of the vaccine regimen on the frequency and phenotypic character of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets including DCs, monocyte populations, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\n\nIII. To assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of the vaccine regimens.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive recombinant Flt3 ligand (CDX-301) subcutaneously (SC) on days -7 to -1, 1-3, and 22-28 of cycle 1 and only on days 1-3 of cycle 2. Patients also receive CDX-1401 SC or intradermally (ID) on day 1 of each cycle and poly-ICLC SC on days 1-2 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive CDX-1401 and poly-ICLC as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 12 weeks and then annually thereafter.",

WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin \\[B-HCG\\]) during the screening period. Follow-up evaluations will include interval sexual/menstrual histories as needed. Men who receive nivolumab or ipilimumab and are sexually active with WOCBP must use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year for the duration of the study and for a period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab or ipilimumab. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician immediately. WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. Women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU/mL to be considered postmenopausal\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients will be eligible for this trial if they are on effective antiretroviral regimens utilizing non-CYP-interactive agents and have an undetectable viral load. If there is evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated. If there is history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the patient must have been treated and have undetectable HCV viral load\n* Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must not have received a liver, lung, heart, or pancreas transplant; or allogeneic stem cell transplant; or any kind of bone marrow transplant\n* Patients must not be unwilling or unable to undergo dialysis\n* Patients must not have prior evidence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or non-HLA donor-specific antibodies (DSA). Patients with detectable DSA but negative dd-cfDNA may be eligible after consultation with the study PI\n* Patients must not have a history of antibody- or cell-mediated allograft rejection within 3 months of study entry\n* Patients must not have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks of study entry or those who have not recovered from adverse events (AEs) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier\n* Patients must not have had prior treatment for their current cancer with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, or anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways\n* Patients must not be receiving any other investigational agents\n* Patients must not have known central nervous system (CNS) metastases or leptomeningeal metastases because of poor prognosis and concerns regarding progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other AEs. Patients with brain metastases are permitted to enroll if metastases have been treated and there is no MRI evidence of progression for 4 weeks after treatment is complete and no evidence of progression within 28 days prior to study entry\n* Patients must not have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody\n* Patients must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to other agents used in study\n* Patients must not have uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because nivolumab and ipilimumab have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with nivolumab or ipilimumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study\n* Patients must not have active autoimmune disease, or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function, and will only be eligible after consultation with the study PI\n\n  * This includes but is not limited to:\n\n    * Immune-related neurologic disease,\n    * Multiple sclerosis,\n    * Autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy,\n    * Guillain-Barre (GB) syndrome,\n    * Myasthenia gravis,\n    * Systemic autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),\n    * Connective tissue diseases,\n    * Scleroderma,\n    * Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; e.g., ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease),\n    * Rheumatoid arthritis, and\n    * Sjogren's syndrome\n* Patients must not have had evidence of active or acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction and abdominal carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel perforation should be evaluated for the potential need for additional treatment before coming on study",

      "detailed_description": "While recent advances in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) with agents targeting PD-1 are striking, there remains a significant need to develop therapies for patients with untreated brain metastases who were excluded from prior trials with MK-3475 and the majority of other studies in these diseases. The brain is a common site of disease spread in many solid tumors, most notably metastatic melanoma and NSCLC. 10-40% of patients with metastatic melanoma develop brain metastases during their lifetime and \\>75% have brain metastases at autopsy. Overall, historical melanoma patient cohorts have reported a median survival of patients with brain metastases in the order of 2.5 - 4 months despite use of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and surgery. One older patient series showed a median survival of \\< 4 months in melanoma patients with brain metastases and a neurological death rate of \\>30% despite the treatment of intracranial metastases with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Among those with NSCLC, 10% have brain metastases at presentation and another 30% develop them over the course of their disease. Survival after the development of brain metastases is as dismal in those with NSCLC as it is for melanoma. Multifocal disease is common in both of these diseases, with about half of patients with CNS disease presenting with more than one brain lesion.\n\nPatients with untreated brain metastases have been excluded from most clinical trials of systemic therapy for two reasons: (1) historically their prognosis has been poor (overall survival ≤ 4 months) and (2) experimental drugs are presumed to not penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) or BBB penetration is not well studied. In melanoma, for example, one phase III study evaluating ipilimumab excluded patients with untreated brain metastases and another study evaluating ipilimumab and dacarbazine excluded all patients with a history of brain metastases, regardless of prior treatment. A subsequent trial with ipilimumab for patients with untreated brain metastases indeed showed that the drug had some activity in treating CNS disease. In the initial vemurafenib studies, patients with progressing or unstable CNS metastases were excluded. The pivotal BRIM-3 trial excluded patients with brain metastases unless metastases had been definitively treated more than three months prior to trial enrollment. Both temodar and sorafenib cross the BBB. Initial studies with sorafenib alone and in combination with chemotherapy excluded patients with active brain metastases. A combination study of temodar and sorafenib in patients with or without brain metastases showed modest activity in patients without a history of prior temodar, and was thought to be favorable in part due to local therapies. Although a number of studies have been conducted for melanoma patients with untreated brain metastases using established therapies, most initial clinical trials with novel agents exclude these patients. A recent trial with dabrafenib, an inhibitor of mutated B-raf, is an exception to the long-standing paradigm. A phase I/II study of this agent included a subset of patients with untreated brain metastases. At the 2010 meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, Long et al reported that nine of the ten patients with untreated cerebral metastases enrolled in this trial had shrinkage of their brain lesions. This was the basis for a recent phase II trial of dabrafenib specific for patients with untreated brain metastases61. In NSCLC, a small number of trials have shown that combination chemotherapy regimens can induce a response in the CNS with untreated brain metastases with a median PFS up to 4 months. These studies demonstrate that asymptomatic brain metastases, similar to asymptomatic metastases in other sites, can be treated systemically on clinical trials, and that drug activity in the CNS is not necessarily different than in other metastatic locations.\n\nCurrent standard of care for brain metastases that require immediate local intervention (based on symptoms, location, size, or other concerning features) is craniotomy with resection or radiation therapy. As an adjunct to standard craniotomy, LITT is emerging as a new, minimally invasive local therapy to treat previously surgically inaccessible brain metastases. Not only is cell death instantaneous, thus decreasing the risk of delayed intra-tumoral hemorrhage, but another theoretical advantage of using LITT as part of management of brain metastases is that the hyperthermia breaks down the blood brain barrier at the edge of the coagulation region thereby possibly increasing access of chemotherapeutic agents into the lesion. In patients in whom either craniotomy or LITT are performed, biopsies of tumor and surrounding normal brain can also be obtained at the time of local therapy.\n\nThe purpose of this trial is to study the activity of MK-3475 in untreated brain metastases from melanoma or NSCLC. Given the promising initial results of MK-3475 in these diseases but the lack of data in patients with untreated brain metastases thus far, this trial will study treatment in this patient population. Additionally, for patients with melanoma this trial requires local therapy with craniotomy or LITT to at least 1 brain lesion prior to systemic therapy, thereby allowing the acquisition of brain tumor tissue for correlative studies on biomarkers that may be predictive of clinical response in the CNS and systemically. There will also be a biopsy of an extra-cerebral metastasis when feasible, particularly when tissue from the brain lesion is not obtained in patients with NSCLC.\n\nUpon results entry, the primary outcome measure was aligned as originally presented in the study protocol (attached with results).",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Biopsy proven metastatic melanoma or NSCLC as follows:\n\n   1. Patients with metastatic melanoma must have untreated brain metastases including:\n\n      * At least one cerebral metastasis that requires local intervention and is amenable to craniotomy or LITT therapy either due to symptoms, lesion size, location, edema or hemorrhage (\"surgical lesion\"). Alternatively, a patient may be eligible if a cerebral metastasis was resected or biopsied any time prior to enrollment and there is tumor tissue available for analysis.\n      * At least one cerebral metastasis that is at least 5 mm AND twice the MRI slice thickness, but less than 20 mm, that is asymptomatic and does not require local therapy at the time of enrollment (\"clinically evaluable lesion(s)\"). OR\n   2. Patients with stage IV NSCLC with at least one cerebral metastasis that is at least 5 mm AND twice the MRI slice thickness, but less than 20 mm, that is asymptomatic and does not require local therapy at the time of enrollment (\"clinically evaluable lesion(s)\").\n2. Age ≥18\n3. ECOG performance status \\< 2\n4. Any number of previous treatments with the exception of previous inhibitors of PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2; other prior systemic therapies must have been administered at least 2 weeks before administration of MK-3475 with the exception of bevacizumab which must have been administered at least 4 weeks prior to MK-3475. Patients are not required to have had prior systemic therapy. The exception to this is patients with NSCLC who test negative for PD-L1 expression or are unevaluable for PD-L1 expression must have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for entry into Cohort 2. Note: Ipilimumab treatment should have been administered at least 4 weeks prior to the start of MK-3475.\n5. Life expectancy of at least 3 months\n6. A history of previously treated brain metastases is allowed, provided that at least 14 days have lapsed between radiation and initiation of MK-3475. Any lesion present at the time of WBRT or included in the stereotactic radiotherapy field (or within 2mm of the treated lesion) will NOT be considered evaluable unless it is new or documented to have progressed since treatment.\n7. PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue from any site is required for patients with NSCLC for entry into Cohort 1. Tumor tissue must be obtained after the last systemic therapy. PD-L1 expression will be analyzed by a Merck assay. For NSCLC Cohort 2, patients may test PD-L1 negative or may be unevaluable for PD-L1 expression (i.e. insufficient tumor tissue). PD-L1 expression is not required for patients with melanoma, but melanoma patients are required to submit an extra-cerebral specimen for analysis, unless it is not feasible to obtain one.\n8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined per protocol.\n9. For women of childbearing potential, agreement to the use of two acceptable methods of contraception, including one barrier method, during the study and for 6 months after discontinuation of MK-3475.\n10. For men with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a latex condom, and to advise their female partner to use an additional method of contraception during the study and for 6 months after discontinuation of MK-3475.\n11. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of commencement of treatment in premenopausal women.\n12. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Symptomatic brain metastases. Symptoms may be present from the surgical lesion prior to resection or LITT but must have resolved by the time of administration of study drug.\n2. Patients with brain metastases for whom complete surgical resection is clinically appropriate.\n3. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy to the lung or brain within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Previous radiation to other sites may be completed at any time prior to initiation of MK-3475.\n\n   1. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.\n   2. Note: Toxicity that has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 is allowed if it meets the inclusion requirements for laboratory parameters.\n4. Has had prior treatment with any other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 or PD-L2 agent or an antibody targeting other immune-regulatory receptors or mechanisms. Examples of such antibodies include (but are not limited to) antibodies against IDO, PD-L1, IL-2R, GITR. Prior ipilimumab, IL2, bevacizumab and adoptive cell therapy is allowed.\n5. The use of corticosteroids to control cerebral edema or treat neurologic symptoms will not be allowed, and patients who previously required corticosteroids for symptom control must be off steroids for at least 2 weeks. Low-dose steroid use (≤10 mg of prednisone or equivalent) as corticosteroid replacement therapy is allowed\n6. Has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n7. Presence of leptomeningeal disease\n8. Has an active automimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of inhaled steroids or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.\n9. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n   Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475.\n10. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents and may not have participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n11. Either a concurrent condition (including medical illness, such as active infection requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics or the presence of laboratory abnormalities) or history of a prior condition that places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were treated with the study drug or a medical condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.\n12. Concurrent, active malignancies in addition to those being studied (other than cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma)\n13. Any contraindication to MRI (i.e. patients with pacemakers or other metal implanted medical devices). An MRI safety questionnaire is required prior to MR imaging.\n14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis\n15. Has a known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B (HBV), or Hepatitis C (HCV) infection.\n16. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n17.

Part 1C (MEL) is added as the third part of the study with Amendment 3. Part 1C will evaluate safety and efficacy for different doses and dosing intervals for IPI in combination with pembrolizumab in participants with advanced MEL.\n\nIn the pembrolizumab + IPI study arms, qualified participants who receive the first course but experience disease progression after discontinuing pembrolizumab with stable disease or better, may, at the investigator's discretion, initiate a second course of pembrolizumab at the same dose and schedule for up to 17 doses (up to \\~1 additional year) + IPI at the same dose and schedule for up to 4 doses (up to \\~12 additional weeks). In the pembrolizumab + PEG-IFN study arms, qualified participants who receive the first course but experience disease progression after discontinuing pembrolizumab with stable disease or better may, at the investigator's discretion, initiate a second course of pembrolizumab at the same dose and schedule for up to 17 doses (up to \\~1 additional year). Per protocol, response or progression during the second course will not count towards efficacy outcome measure and adverse events during the second course will not count towards safety outcome measures.\n\nPart 2 (MEL and RCC) is a randomized portion of the trial and will evaluate preliminary efficacy of the drug combinations for advanced MEL participants.

      "brief_summary": "Over 5 million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year, more than all other cancers combined. Most of these cases are caused by excess exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun and artificial sources such as indoor tanning. Melanoma, approximately 87,000 of the annual skin cancer cases and one of the more deadly skin cancers, is on the rise. Previous research on these individuals suggests that while some change how much time they spend in the sun and adopt ways to protect themselves when in the sun, many do not. In our previous study, we found that 20% of melanoma survivors reported a sunburn in the past year and 10% intentionally went outside for a tan, both strong indicators of inappropriate sun exposure. Melanoma survivors are at high risk of second melanomas, making it critical that they spend less time in the sun or take actions to protect themselves when they are in the sun.\n\nNo studies to date have investigated technology-based strategies in melanoma survivors to improve sun exposure and protection behaviors. This project will test whether a wearable device that tracks sun exposure and provides alerts regarding sun exposure and protection behaviors will increase sun protection behaviors in melanoma survivors. The use of wearable technology devices (e.g., Fitbit) has grown quickly over the last decade and studies using these devices to promote physical activity and weight loss have been promising. We will test the technology device versus a similar control device in 368 melanoma survivors and compare sun protection behaviors between the two groups.\n\nThis project has the potential to identify a strategy that could significantly lower the number of melanoma survivors who go on to have a second melanoma diagnosis. Importantly, this easy to use technology could also be utilized by survivors' family members, who are also at higher risk for melanoma, and the general population as a means to reduce risk of all forms of skin cancer.",

      "brief_summary": "This will be a multi-center, proof of concept phase 0 study to assess the suppression of p-AKT in Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and meningiomas by AR-42 in adult patients undergoing tumor resection. AR-42 is a small molecule which crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB) in rodents, but the investigators are not certain yet if it will penetrate human VS. Meningiomas are outside the BBB, but seem to be unusually resistant to all current medical treatments. The primary endpoint of the bioactivity of suppression of p-AKT by AR-42 was selected as drug activity seems more informative than bioavailability. Our preclinical data and others have shown dose dependent suppression of p-AKT by AR-42 in both VS and meningiomas.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a multi-center, proof of concept phase 0 study to assess the suppression of p-AKT in VS and meningiomas by AR-42 in adult patients undergoing NF2-tumor resection. AR-42 will be administered three times per week beginning 3 weeks prior to surgery. A total of ten doses, +/- 1 dose at 40 mg/dose, will be self-administered orally by study participants at approximately the same time every day (+/- 1 hour, preferably in the evening) 3 times per week for 3 weeks pre-operatively, with the last dose taken the night before surgery. Patients will be evaluated within the context of their standard post-operative follow up which includes within 2 days of surgery and again at 2 weeks (+/- 10 days) after surgery. Samples will be shipped to the participating laboratories (OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC) Pharmacoanalytical Shared Resource (PhASR) and Nationwide Children's Research Institute) for assessment of intratumoral drug concentration and assessment of intratumoral disease markers. During surgery, four blood samples will also be obtained and sent to the cooperating laboratory (PhASR) for determination of drug concentration and molecular analysis.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with vestibular schwannoma and/or meningioma diagnosed by MRI where surgical resection has been selected as treatment.\n* Patients diagnosed with NF2 must meet Manchester Criteria.\n* Age \\> 18 years of age\n* Prior biologic therapy, chemotherapy, surgery or radiation is permitted.\n* At the time of screening, the patient must have normal organ and marrow function.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/World Health Organization (ECOG/WHO) performance status of 0-1.\n* Patients must be able to swallow capsules.\n* Patients or their legal representatives must be able to read, understand and provide informed consent to participate in the trial.\n* Tumor type will be confirmed by a neuropathologist.\n* Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL prior to starting AR-42.\n* The patient must be willing to comply with fertility requirements\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects of AR-42 are not known. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with AR-42, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with AR-42.\n* Pediatric patients are excluded from the phase 0 study as the effects of AR-42 are not known on children and there is no potential direct benefit to them.\n* Patients with malabsorption or any other condition that in the opinion of the principal investigator could cause difficulty in absorption of drug.\n* Patients requiring chronic corticosteroids (dose equivalent \\> 20mg prednisolone).\n* Concurrent use of complementary or alternative medicines that in the opinion of the principal investigator would confound the interpretation of toxicities and/or antitumor activity of the study drug.\n* Patients with a \"currently active\" second malignancy that, in the opinion of the principal investigator, will interfere with patient participation, increase patient risk, or confound data interpretation.\n* Patients with a mean QTcB \\> 450 msec in males and \\> 470 msec in females.\n* Patients with long QT syndrome.\n* Patients who are being treated for an active infection.\n* Patients receiving the following concomitant medications:\n\n  * Any other anti-neoplastic chemotherapy or biologic therapy during the study\n  * Concomitant radiotherapy\n  * Concomitant HDAC inhibitors (e.g. valproic acid) as class-specific adverse reactions may be additive\n  * Use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors including G-CSF, pegylated G-CSF or GM-CSF should follow ASCO guidelines for patients receiving anti-cancer therapy.\n  * Drugs associated with QT/QTc prolongation (see Appendix A)\n* Patients who are receiving concurrent anti-neoplastic therapy.\n* Any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by the principal investigator to likely interfere with a patient's ability to sign informed consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation of the results.\n* Patients with significant cardiovascular disease, including a myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months or unstable cardiac arrhythmias are not eligible for the study.\n* Known HIV infection, as their immunosuppressive conditions may complicate potential pancytopenias seen with HDAC inhibitors and complicate evaluation of drug effect.",

While Study 726 was ongoing, the sponsor considered that therapy with lanreotide Autogel should continue to be an option to patients with stable disease at the end of the 96-week treatment period. This extension study was therefore initiated (Study 2-55-52030-729 (729)) which investigated the long term safety of treatment with lanreotide Autogel and enabled investigators to continue to treat their patients who had stable disease, as well as to treat placebo patients who experienced disease progression during the initial 96-week study (Study 726).",

Explore the association of ITK protein expression with OR and PFS.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Explore association between other putative targets of ibrutinib (e.g. Tec, ErbB4, Hck, Yes, BTK) in melanoma cells, as assessed by 2-color immunofluorescence (IF) in representative tissue sections obtained from pretreatment archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks or FFPE blocks obtained from fresh tissue biopsy from enrolled patients, with overall response (OR) and PFS.\n\nII. Explore ibrutinib-mediated effect(s) on immune cell subsets associated with immunomodulation by performing multiparameter flow cytometric analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) obtained prior to treatment, on day 29 (i.e., predose day 1 of cycle 2) following initiation of treatment with ibrutinib, and at the time of disease progression (3 time points).\n\nIII. Determine pharmacokinetics (PK) of ibrutinib following daily dosing at 840 mg on day 8 of cycle 1 (Css).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

The investigators seek to evaluate the performance of SSE by women and find out if women seek care with a dermatologist for a concerning mole or for a melanoma screening examination by a dermatologist after reviewing the materials received during the mammogram visit. The purpose of this study is to enhance the early detection of melanoma among women who are engaging in health promotion by having mammograms. The investigators specifically aim to evaluate the performance of SSE by women, who receive information during their mammogram appointment, and then follow-up with dermatology for a melanoma screening examination.",
      "detailed_description": "The proposed study is the second phase of a project assessing the feasibility and effectiveness of enhancing the early detection of melanomas among women, who are engaging in health promotion by having mammograms. The initial phase of the project framed risk messages, developed posters and brochures with the input provided by women undergoing screening mammograms, and assessed the feasibility of delivering the program during the mammogram visit at the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center of Northwestern Medicine/ Prentice Women's Hospital. The investigators seek to evaluate performance of skin self-examination (SSE) by women, who receive information during their mammogram appointment, and follow-up with dermatology for a melanoma screening examination. In the second phase, a more intensive intervention in which women will not only receive information about SSE, but will also receive a reminder to perform SSE one week after the screening mammogram and information on how to schedule an appointment with dermatology will be provided. The number of women who perform SSE at home and find a concerning mole (lesion), number who see a dermatologist, and number who have a concerning lesion biopsied will be compared in two arms of the study 1) women who receive the intensive intervention 2) women who receive the informational brochure about SSE alone. The hypothesis is that women who receive more the intensive educational intervention will be more likely to perform SSE at home and schedule a follow-up dermatologist appointment as compared to those who receive the information brochure alone. This project builds upon Robinson's successful SSE training program for melanoma patients that resulted in patients' accurate evaluations of suspicious lesions relative to dermatologists' skin examinations.",

      "detailed_description": "Cancer treatments that couple pharmacological activation of tumor antigen presentation with activation and expansion of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor environment have the potential to induce an effective anti-tumor immune response in patients. NKTR-262 is a small molecule agonist of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7/8 designed to be retained in the tumor micro-environment in order to activate antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells, to create new antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. As a CD122-biased agonist, bempegaldesleukin monotherapy increases newly proliferative CD8+ T cells in tumors. NKTR-262 plus bempegaldesleukin is expected to increase expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In preclinical studies, a single IT injection of NKTR-262 plus IV bempegaldesleukin resulted in complete abscopal effects in tumor models. Preliminary clinical data show bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab enhances immune-stimulatory responses. The REVEAL trial will assess safety and anti-tumor activity of NKTR-262 with bempegaldesleukin +/- nivolumab for the treatment of selected cancers.\n\n* Melanoma (1st-line and relapsed/refractory)\n* Merkel Cell Carcinoma (2nd-line and relapsed/refractory)\n* Triple Negative Breast Cancer (1st- and 2nd-line and relapsed/refractory)\n* Renal Cell Carcinoma (1st-line and relapsed/refractory)\n* Colorectal Cancer (2nd-line and relapsed/refractory; MSI non-high)\n* Colorectal Cancer (2nd 3rd-line+, I-O therapy naive; relapsed/refractory; MSI high)\n* Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (2nd-line and relapsed/refractory)\n* Sarcoma (2nd-line and relapsed/refractory)",

Patients were randomized to receive either vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Study treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurred. The data and safety monitoring board recommended that patients in the dacarbazine group be allowed to cross over to receive vemurafenib, and the protocol was amended accordingly on January 14, 2011, as both overall survival and progression-free survival endpoints had met the prespecified criteria for statistical significance in favor of vemurafenib.",

      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 1, multicenter, open-label study of talimogene laherparepvec in Japanese participants with unresectable stage IIIB-IVM1c malignant melanoma that are candidates for intralesional therapy. The Screening period is 28 days prior to study enrollment. There will be a Treatment period, Safety Follow-up period and a Long Term Follow-up period.\n\nThe Screening Period: Informed consent will be obtained prior to screening procedures. Screening procedures to determine eligibility include: medical history (including concomitant medications, prior therapy for melanoma and BRAF status (if known)), physical exam, vital signs, assessment of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance level status, electrocardiogram (ECG), laboratory assessments (including hepatitis serology), baseline tumor assessments, and adverse events assessment.\n\nTreatment Period: Initially, 6 Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT)-evaluable participants will be enrolled and treated at 100% dose regimen of talimogene laherparepvec (Up to 4.0 mL of 10_6 PFU/mL followed by a dose of up to 4.0 mL of 10_8 PFU/mL). Upon demonstration of safety based on DLT incidence in the first 6 participants, an additional 12 participants will be enrolled and treated at Dose 1 to obtain additional safety data. If dose de-escalation is needed based on the DLT evaluation of first 6 participants, then additional 6 participants will be treated at lower dose (up to 4.0 mL of 10_6 PFU/mL followed by a dose of up to 4.0 mL of 10_7PFU/mL). The duration of treatment will vary for each participants. Participants will be treated until the participant has a DLT during the DLT evaluation period, participant has achieved a Complete Response, no injectable lesions, clinically relevant (resulting in clinical deterioration or requiring change in therapy) disease progression beyond 24-weeks of treatment, or safety concern, whichever occurs first. Maximum treatment duration will be 48 months. The total study duration for an individual participant can be up to 4 years.\n\nDrug Administration: If the participants are found to be eligible to take part in this study, they will receive talimogene laherparepvec by intralesional injection only into injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nodal tumors, with or without image ultrasound guidance. The first injection of talimogene laherparepvec will take place on day 1 (week 0). The second injection should be administered 3 weeks (+ 5 days) after the initial injection. Subsequent injections should be given every 2 weeks (± 3 days).\n\nStudy Visits: The participant will have a physical exam along with vital signs and ECOG. At any study visit blood may be collected to monitor health and safety, and effects of talimogene laherparepvec. Adverse events and medications taken will be reviewed at each study visit. The tumor assessment, physical exams, and ECOG performance status will be completed after 12 (± 1) weeks on treatment (ie, day 1 of week 11), and then every 12 (± 1) weeks (eg, weeks 23, 35, 47 etc.), or more frequently if clinically indicated, until Progressive disease beyond 6 months of treatment or until the start of a new anticancer therapy.\n\nCentral Lab tests: Blood for herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) Antibody Serostatus will collected within 3 days prior to dose at day 1 (week 0) and at week 5. Throughout the trial any participant developing a lesion of suspected herpetic origin will have a swab of the lesion for presence of talimogene laherparepvec DNA obtained within 3 days of the event.\n\nExposure to talimogene laherparepvec by the healthcare providers of the participant and/or close contacts will be assessed.\n\nSafety Follow Visit: A safety follow-up visit will be performed 30 (+7) days after the last dose. The participant will have a physical exam, have vital signs taken, assessment of ECOG status and have weight measured. Adverse events will be assessed as well as the concomitant medications. Routine bloodwork and tumor response assessments will be performed.\n\nLong-Term Follow-up Visits: Follow-up for survival status and, if applicable, commencement of any subsequent anticancer melanoma therapy will occur every 12 weeks (± 28 days) by phone or clinic visit for all participants who permanently discontinue talimogene laherparepvec for any reason other than withdrawal of full consent for up to 24 months after the last participant is enrolled in the study. For participants that discontinue talimogene laherparepvec for reason other than disease progression, the following additional procedures will be conducted during the long-term follow-up: radiographic tumor imaging, clinical tumor assessments, ECOG Performance Status assessments, reporting of pregnancy or lactation, assessment of swabs of lesions of suspected herpetic origin for presence of talimogene laherparepvec DNA, and tumor response assessments until documented disease progression beyond 24-weeks of treatment, until the start of a new anticancer therapy, or end of study, whichever is earliest. If a participant discontinues therapy more than 24 months after the last participant was enrolled in the study, when the long-term follow-up period ends, they will not enter long-term follow-up.",

To characterize the efficacy of the combination therapy. II. To identify markers of response to trigriluzole in the tumor microenvironment.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trigriluzole.\n\nPatients receive trigriluzole orally (PO) every other day (QOD), twice daily (BID), every morning (QAM) or every bedtime (QHS) on days -14 to -1. Patients then receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes every 2 weeks beginning week 1 and trigriluzole PO QOD, BID, QAM or QHS. Once the MTD of trigriluzole with nivolumab is identified, patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks beginning week 1 and trigriluzole PO.

Patients will be evaluated in 2 parts. Part A patients will be selected using a flow cytometric assay that quantifies intratumoral PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4+ \"exhausted\" lymphocytes in the tumor. Part B will enroll patients who have or are failing pembrolizumab at least 12 weeks after starting Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody alone or in combination, or, who have been selected using a flow cytometric assay that quantifies intratumoral PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4+ \"exhausted\" lymphocytes in the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "Closed to enrollment earlier than expected due to high response rate in order to advance to phase 2b in proven PD-1-refractory patients. A total of 24 patients were consented instead of the planned enrollment of 42 patients.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have histological or cytological diagnosis of melanoma with progressive locally advanced or metastatic disease that is not amenable to definitive local therapy with curative intent.\n* At least one measurable tumor accessible for intratumoral injection and EP on investigator's assessment.\n* Patients may have had prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy or radiation therapy. All prior therapies must be stopped 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment, with the exception of patients who have received ipilimumab, which must be stopped 6 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment. Patients are prohibited from receiving live vaccines within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Age \\>= 18 years\n* Part A: Patient has agreed to two newly obtained tumor biopsies and as required re-biopsies (that can be biopsied on investigator's assessment) and to providing the acquired tissue for biomarker analysis. Analysis of one of the fresh biopsy samples for PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4hi in the CD8+CD45+ gate based on flow cytometry will be done. A second fresh biopsy sample is required for further biomarker analysis and confirmation at a later date of low PD-L1 expression using an Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay for PD-L1 expression. A valid flow cytometry result is not required for study participation, but repeated biopsy for reanalysis is strongly recommended for patient with insufficient tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in the first tissue sample. Or:\n* Part B: Anti-PD-1 non-responders are defined as those showing disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 after at least 12 weeks of therapy with a PD-1 antibody either alone or in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitor or targeted therapies according to their label. There is no serological requirement.\n* Life expectancy of at least 6 months.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.\n* Adequate organ function within 4 weeks of administration of study therapy:\n\n  1.

Adequate renal function:\n\n     1. Serum creatinine: ≤1.5 x ULN\n  5. Coagulation:\n\n     1. International normalized ration (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT): ≤1.5 x ULN (Only if not using anticoagulants. If patient is receiving anticoagulants, then value must be within therapeutic range for the condition that patient is being treated for).\n     2. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): \\<=1.5 x ULN (Only if not using anticoagulants. If patient is receiving anticoagulants, then value must be within therapeutic range for the condition that patient is being treated for).\n* Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 14 days prior to administration of study therapy.\n* The effects of pIL-12 EP and pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential (not free from menses for \\>2 years, post hysterectomy/oophorectomy, or surgically sterilized) must agree to use two methods of contraception, or abstain from heterosexual activity, during participation in study, from the time of consent through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. The two methods must include at least one \"barrier method\". Barrier methods are diaphragms, cervical caps, cervical shields, male condoms, and female condoms. The second method of contraception may be another barrier method, a copper containing intrauterine device (IUD), spermicidal foams, sponges and films, or hormone-based contraception (for example, hormone pills, hormone rings, hormone patches, hormone-releasing IUDs, or Depo Provera). Men with partners who are capable of getting pregnant must agree to use one of the barrier methods of contraception listed above during participation in the study, starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign and date it.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of administration of study therapy.\n* Patient is expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while on study; including systemic chemotherapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy not specified in this protocol.\n* Patient has uveal melanoma.\n* Patient has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable without the use of systemic steroids for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry.\n* Patient has risk factors for bowel obstruction or bowel perforation (examples include but not limited to a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and abdominal carcinomatosis).\n* Patient previously had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another monoclonal antibody (mAb).\n* Patient has a history of history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.\n* Patient has active infection at time of study entry that require systemic antibiotics and/or with an oral temperature of \\>= 38.3 degrees Celsius (°C)(100.9 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)) within 5 days of first treatment.\n* Patients with electronic pacemakers or defibrillators are excluded from this study, as the effect of electroporation on these devices is unknown. Patients with lower extremity lesions may be discussed with the medical monitor.\n* Patient has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be exception to this rule. Patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidism that is stable on hormone replacement will not be excluded from the study.\n* Patient has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or requires any other form of immunosuppressive medication. However, patients using physiologic replacement doses of hydrocortisone, or its equivalent, will be considered eligible for this study; up to 20 mg hydrocortisone (or 5 mg of prednisone) in the morning and 10 mg hydrocortisone (or 2.5 mg of prednisone) in the evening.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects upon treatment with pIL-12 EP + pembrolizumab is unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pIL-12 EP + pembrolizumab breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pIL-12 EP + pembrolizumab.\n* Patients with symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A patient who is clinically stable following treatment for these conditions is eligible.\n* Patient is Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Ab positive or HBSAg positive.",

Participants received daily oral doses of 10 mg everolimus or matching placebo as study drug. In both arms, the study drug was combined with best supportive care and treatment cycles were defined as 28 days. Participants were treated until disease progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0, intolerable toxicity, death, lost to follow-up or consent withdrawal. Regardless of the reason for study drug discontinuation, participants had a safety follow-up visit scheduled 30 days after the last dose of the study drug.\n\nPer data monitoring committee recommendation, all participants on treatment with placebo were allowed to crossover to open-label treatment with everolimus. This change was implemented through protocol amendment 3 (issued on 06-May-2016) after which remaining participants entered into open-label phase of the study.",

Approximately 63 patients with histologically proven stage IIIc or stage IV melanoma who fail to qualify for curative surgery and who bear one or more tumors that are accessible for direct injections and at least one measurable lesion by RECIST 1.1 criteria will be considered.\n\nProspective patients will attend the study center for initial screening within 28 days prior to treatment with CVA21. They will have the nature of the study and its procedures and risks fully explained. All patients must provide a written informed consent to participate in the study.\n\nThe dose of CVA21 for this study is 3 x 108 TCID50 (about 4.5 x 106 TCID50/kg for a 70-kg patient) by IT administration. Each patient will receive 4 separate CVA21 administrations in the first 8 days on trial (Days 1, 3, 5 and 8), followed by a fifth dose 2 weeks later (Day 22) and further administrations at 3 weekly intervals (Days 43, 64, 85, 106 and 127, up to a maximum of 10 sets of injections) or until confirmed disease progression or development of excessive toxicity.\n\nDisease status will be assessed by contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and/or direct caliper measurement (and ultrasound assistance, if necessary) and categorized by immune-related RECIST 1.1 criteria prior to commencing treatment (baseline) and at Days 43, 85, 127 and 169 and 12-weekly intervals thereafter until disease progression. At 2 years, intervals can increase to 6 months.\n\nAt 12 weeks post-commencement of treatment (Day 85), if a patient's disease status is classed as progressive disease (but without rapid clinical deterioration) the patient may remain on the trial for a further 6 weeks, when his/her disease status will be confirmed prior to the scheduled treatment. If disease progression is confirmed, the patient will cease treatment but will remain on the study and be observed for efficacy and safety until initiation of treatment with non-CVA21 anticancer therapies. However, survival will be followed until death. If stable disease or better (CR or PR) is observed at this time, the patient will continue treatment as per the protocol. Complete and partial responses will be confirmed at the next contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scan analysis.\n\nPatients who have evidence of biologic activity, i.e., tumor inflammatory reaction and/or stable disease or better, at 18 weeks (Day 127) are eligible to participate in the extension trial in which they will continue to receive IT injections of CVA21 every 3 weeks up to a total of 1 year of therapy from the first injection.\n\nThroughout the trial, immunological responses to the tumor and CVA21 will be monitored.\n\nAfter the full CVA21 injection schedule has been completed, patients will be followed at 12-weekly intervals beginning on Day 169 for a total of 12 months according to the schedule for safety assessment and indefinitely for survival. Patients with progressive disease (but without rapid clinical deterioration) at 6 months (Day 169) will have a further tumor assessment 6 weeks later for confirmation or continuation of observation for duration of disease control and all subjects will be followed for survival. Patients who are withdrawn from treatment with CVA21 during the treatment phase must also be followed up every 6 weeks for 12 weeks for safety and for survival.",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together with or without cisplatin and etoposide and to see how well they work in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cisplatin and etoposide with or without veliparib may work better in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer or metastatic large cell neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of veliparib to use in combination with cisplatin and etoposide (CE). (Phase I) II. To determine whether the addition of ABT-888 (veliparib) to cisplatin etoposide (CE) results in improved progression free survival (PFS) over CE with placebo in the frontline therapy of newly diagnosed extensive stage small cell lung cancer. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the overall survival (OS) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888. (Phase II) II. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) as well as complete response rate (CRR) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888. (Phase II) III. To determine the toxicity profile of the combination of ABT-888 and CE chemotherapy in this patient population. (Phase II)\n\nOTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To conduct exploratory correlative analysis of the impact of the select biomarkers. (Phase II) II. To compare the overall toxicity profile and specifically the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with the addition of ABT-888 to CE. (Phase II)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.\n\nPhase I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, etoposide intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPhase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM D: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM E: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.",

      "brief_summary": "Combination therapy is becoming more and more general in the treatment of oncological diseases. In this clinical trial combination the standard immunotherapeutic treatment; the programmed death 1 (PD-1) regulatory antibody Nivolumab and a peptide vaccine consisting of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) peptides will be tested in patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients will be treated with Nivolumab every second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine is given from start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6 vaccines and thereafter every fourth week up to 1 year.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nHuge advances have been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma (MM) the past 5 years. Especially immunotherapy has shown promising results.\n\nCancer cells are naturally attacked by cells of the immune system, but can induce a state of tolerance whereby they escape from immune attack. This escape is brought about by many mechanisms. An important one is the programmed death pathway (PD-1/PD-L1). PD-L1 is commonly overexpressed on cancer cells. Interaction of PD-1 on activated T cells and PD-L1 on cancer cells lead to inhibition of the cytotoxic T cells. Another important mechanism is through overexpression of the metabolic enzyme IDO on cancer cells. Activation of IDO also inhibits cytotoxic T cells.\n\nInvestigators have recently identified spontaneous T cell reactivity against PD-L1 and IDO in the tumor microenvironment and in the peripheral blood of patients with MM and healthy donors. Both IDO and PD-L1 reactive CD8 T cells are cytotoxic and can kill cancer cells and immune regulatory cells in vitro.. Thus boosting specific T cells that recognize immune regulatory proteins such as IDO and PD-L1 may directly modulate immune regulation.\n\nDue to distinct mechanisms of action, the combination of treatment with a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 (Nivolumab) and a vaccine with peptides against PD-L1 and IDO may have a synergistic effect.\n\nInvestigators have previously reported a phase I trial where, the IDO peptide was tested in 15 patients with MM in combination with Ipilimumab, and no grade 3-4 toxicity was seen. The PD-L1 peptide is currently being tested in a first-in-man study in patients with multiple myeloma.\n\nMethods:\n\nA two-step clinical phase I/II trial design will be used, starting out with a pilot study including 6 patients with MM to test feasibility and tolerability. If the treatment is found feasible the study will be extended to a phase II study with 24 patients. The objective is to describe anti-tumor immune responses and objective responses using RECIST 1.1.\n\nPatients will be treated with Nivolumab in accordance with standard regimen, which involves outpatient IV infusions every second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine is given from start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6 vaccines and thereafter every fourth week up to 1 year. 15 vaccines will be administered in total.\n\nPatients will be followed with clinical controls and diagnostic imaging every 12 weeks. Patients who receive all vaccines will have follow up after 3 and 6 months in parallel with standard of care treatment for Nivolumab.",

      "intervention": "Cabozantinib S-malate; Dacarbazine; Laboratory Biomarker Analysis; Temozolomide",
      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well cabozantinib-s-malate works compared with temozolomide or dacarbazine in treating patients with melanoma of the eye (ocular melanoma) that has spread to other parts of the body and cannot be removed by surgery. Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether cabozantinib-s-malate works better than temozolomide or dacarbazine in treating patients with melanoma of the eye.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Compare the progression-free survival rate at 4 months (PFS4) of patients with ocular melanoma treated with cabozantinib-s-malate (cabozantinib) or temozolomide (or dacarbazine).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate the distribution of progression-free survival (PFS) times. II. Estimate the distribution of overall survival (OS) times. III. Estimate the confirmed response rate as determined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\n\nIV. Assess the safety of these agents by examining the toxicity profile. V. Correlate the response of MET molecular status.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If temozolomide is not available, patients receive dacarbazine intravenously (IV) over 15-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 2 years.",

      "detailed_description": "This was a two-arm, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, international phase III study of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus two matching placebos in the adjuvant treatment of melanoma after surgical resection. Patients with completely resected, histologically confirmed, BRAF V600E/K mutation-positive, high-risk \\[Stage IIIa (lymph node metastasis \\>1 mm), IIIb or IIIc\\] cutaneous melanoma were screened for eligibility. Subjects were randomized to receive either dabrafenib (150 milligram (mg) twice daily \\[BID\\]) and trametinib (2 mg once daily \\[QD\\]). None of the patients had undergone previous systemic anticancer treatment or radiotherapy for melanoma. All the patients had undergone completion lymphadenectomy with no clinical or radiographic evidence of residual regional node disease within 12 weeks before randomization, had recovered from definitive surgery, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. BRAF V600 mutation status was confirmed in primary-tumor or lymph-node tissue by a central reference laboratory. All the patients provided written informed consent.\n\nThe primary end point was recurrence-free survival, Overall survival, as the key secondary end point, was to be tested in a hierarchical manner only if the primary end point met the criteria for significance. The overall survival analysis used a preplanned three-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design with an O'Brien-Fleming-type boundary, which was used to determine the significance threshold for the first interim overall survival analysis (two-sided P=0.000019).\n\nDisease assessments included clinical examination and imaging by means of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or both.) Imaging was performed every 3 months during the first 24 months, then every 6 months until disease recurrence or the completion of the trial. Follow-up for survival began after recurrence and continued through the end of the trial. Adverse events and laboratory values were assessed at screening, on the date of randomization, at least once per month through month 12, and at every visit for disease-recurrence assessment after month 12. Adverse events and laboratory values were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Completely resected histologically confirmed high-risk \\[Stage IIIa (LN metastasis more than 1 mm), IIIb or IIIc cutaneous melanoma determined to be V600E/K mutation positive by a central laboratory. Patients presenting with initial resectable lymph node recurrence after a diagnosis of Stage I or II melanoma are eligible.\n* Surgically rendered free of disease no more than 12 weeks before randomization.\n* Recovered from definitive surgery (e.g. no uncontrolled wound infections or indwelling drains).\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1.\n* Adequate hematologic, hepatic, renal and cardiac function.\n\nKey Exclusion Criteria:\n\n* Known mucosal or ocular melanoma or the presence of unresectable in-transit metastases.\n* Evidence of distant metastatic disease.\n* Prior systemic anti-cancer treatment and radiotherapy for melanoma; prior surgery for melanoma is allowed.\n* History of another malignancy or concurrent malignancy including prior malignant melanoma. Exceptions to this include: Patients who have been disease-free for 5 years or patients with a history completely resected non-melanoma skin cancer or successfully treated in situ carcinoma are eligible, for example cervical cancer in situ, atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or melanoma in situ, multiple primary melanomas, or other malignancies for which the patient has been disease free for \\> 5 years.\n* History or current evidence of cardiovascular risk.\n* History or current evidence of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) or central serous retinopathy (CSR)",

Treatments given in an adjuvant setting (eg, interferon, radiotherapy, isolated limb perfusion, or investigational agents) are not considered as prior lines of therapy. No prior talimogene laherparepvec, other oncolytic virus therapies, or tumor vaccines are allowed, even if given in the adjuvant setting.\n  * Subjects treated with prior ipilimumab must have had partial response (PR), complete response (CR), or at least 6 months of stable disease followed by disease progression.\n  * Subjects previously treated with anti-program death-1 (PD1) or anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) antibodies must not have discontinued therapy due to any treatment-related adverse events including immune-related adverse events. Prior treatment-related adverse events should also be fully resolved and not requiring treatment for at least 28 days prior to randomization.\n* Measurable disease defined as one or both of the following\n\n  * at least 1 melanoma lesion that can be accurately and serially measured in at least 2 dimensions and for which the longest diameter is ≥ 10 mm and with perpendicular diameter ≥ 5 mm as measured by contrast-enhanced or spiral computed tomography (CT) scan for visceral or nodal/soft tissue disease. Lymph nodes must measure \\> 15 mm in their short axis to be considered measurable by CT scan.\n  * at least 1 superficial cutaneous or subcutaneous melanoma lesion that can be accurately and serially measured in at least 2 dimensions and for which the short axis is ≥ 5 mm as measured by calipers\n* Injectable disease (ie, suitable for direct injection or through the use of ultrasound \\[US\\] guidance) defined as follows:\n\n  * at least 1 injectable cutaneous, subcutaneous, or nodal melanoma lesion ≥ 5 mm in longest diameter\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1\n* Adequate hematologic, hepatic, renal, and coagulation functions\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Primary uveal or mucosal melanoma\n* History or evidence of melanoma associated with immunodeficiency states (eg, hereditary immune deficiency, organ transplant, or leukemia)\n* Phase 1b: History or evidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastases\n* Phase 2: Clinically active cerebral melanoma metastases. Subjects with up to 3 cerebral metastases, and neurological performance status of 0 may be enrolled, provided that all lesions have been adequately treated with stereotactic radiation therapy, craniotomy, or Gamma knife therapy, with no evidence of progression, and have not required steroids, for at least 2 months prior to enrollment.\n* History or evidence of symptomatic autoimmune disease (such as pneumonitis, glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, or other), or history of autoimmune disease that required systemic treatment (ie, use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs or biological agents used for treatment of autoimmune diseases) in past 2 months prior to enrollment. Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine for hypothyroidism, insulin for diabetes mellitus) is not considered a form of systemic treatment for autoimmune disease.\n* History of or plan for splenectomy or splenic irradiation\n* Active herpetic skin lesions or prior complications of herpes simplex type-1 virus (HSV-1) infection (eg, herpetic keratitis or encephalitis).\n* Requires intermittent or chronic systemic (intravenous or oral) treatment with an antiherpetic drug (eg, acyclovir), other than intermittent topical use\n* Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease\n* Known acute or chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection\n* Phase 1b: Prior talimogene laherparepvec, ipilimumab, other CTLA-4 inhibitors, PD-1 inhibitors, or tumor vaccine\n* Phase 2: Prior talimogene laherparepvec, other oncolytic virus therapies, or tumor vaccines\n* Currently receiving or less than 28 days since ending systemic anticancer treatment for unresected stage IIIB to IV melanoma",

      "brief_summary": "The majority of melanoma vaccines tested to date have been antigen-specific vaccines targeting melanoma-specific or associated antigens and utilizing a variety of delivery systems and immune-adjuvants. As opposed to testing an \"off the shelf\" vaccine that might be able to treat a subset of patients, our approach has been personalized to the patient and applicable to all patients. Our vaccine approach consists of harnessing the most potent antigen presenting cell in the body - the dendritic cell (DC) - together with the full repertoire of tumor antigens from an individual's cancer. We have conducted phase I and II studies using an autologous DC-tumor cell fusion technique that has now been simplified into a DC-tumor cell lysate vaccine. The autologous tumor lysate (TL) is loaded into yeast cell wall particles (YCWP) that are naturally and efficiently taken up into the patient's DC. These autologous tumor lysate, particle-loaded, DC (TLPLDC) are injected intradermally (ID) monthly x 3 followed by boosters at 6, 12, and 18 months.",
      "detailed_description": "Stage III and Stage IV (resected) melanoma patients will be identified prior to definitive surgery and screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be counseled and consented for tissue procurement. Enrolled patients will have their disease surgically resected and a portion 1mg minimum of their melanoma sterilely frozen in provided freezing vials and storage tubes. This tissue will be shipped in liquid nitrogen shippers through FedEx to our central facility in Greenville SC and stored frozen until vaccine preparation. If patients cannot be rendered disease-free, they will be considered screen failures for this study. If melanoma is being resected from multiple locations primary and nodes two different metastatic sites then samples of each would be preferred but not mandatory.\n\nAs indicated by SoC per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and determined by the treating team, if a patient is to receive systemic therapy (chemotherapy or IFN-aguidelines) and determined by the treating team, if a patient is to receive systemic therapy (chemotherapy or IFN-central facility in Greenville, SC) and stored frozen until vaccine preparation. If patients cannot be rendered disease-free, they will receive a single injection of Neupogen (G-CSF) 300 mod (or its equivalent) SQ 24-48 hrs. prior to having 70 mL of blood collected and sent to our central facility for DC isolation and preparation. Patients who cannot tolerate Neupogen, or its equivalent or refuse it, will have 120 mL of blood drawn and sent. Additional blood may be drawn if additional vaccine doses need to be made or re-made for any reason. Vaccines will be prepared by producing TL through freeze/thaw cycling and then loaded into pre-prepared YCWP. The TL-loaded YCWP will be introduced to the DC for phagocytosis thus creating the TLPLDC vaccine which will be frozen in single dose vials. Each vial will contain 1-1.5 x 106 TLPLDC and will be labeled with the patient's unique study number.\n\nBased on their randomization, autologous TLPLDC (active vaccine) or unloaded YCWP + autologous DC (control) will be sent back to the site in a blinded fashion. Regardless of assigned group, the site will receive 6 single dose vials to be injected intradermal monthly x 3 followed by boosters at 6, 12, and 18 months in the same lymph node draining area (preferably the anterior thigh). Patients must begin vaccinations between 3 weeks and 3 months from completion of (SoC). Frozen tumor will be maintained for active vaccines for all patients to include the control patients. The latter will be offered their active vaccine at time of recurrence in a crossover fashion. Additionally, control patients who do not recur will be offered active vaccine at the completion of the trial.\n\nSafety data will be collected on local and systemic toxicities and graded and reported per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.\n\nDisease-free status will be monitored per SoC as outlined by NCCN. Suspected recurrences will be documented with biopsy and pathologic confirmation. Time to recurrence will be based on date of randomization to time of confirmed recurrence.\n\nRecurrent patients will be offered participation in the open label portion of the study. New active vaccine will be made for all patients, and they will be inoculated at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 mos. Patients will be treated per SoC for their recurrence. Safety and tumor response will be assessed per RECIST and irRC on their SoC follow-up scans.\n\nBlood (50 mL) will be collected from all patients prior to each inoculation and at 24 months from enrollment for a total of 7 time points or a total of 350 mL of blood over 2 years. The collected blood will be sent to our central facility for immunologic testing of the T-cell response.",

This study evaluated the objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), duration of response, overall survival (OS), safety and efficacy, to assess steady state (all subjects) exposure to dabrafenib, dabrafenib metabolites, and trametinib and characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of dabrafenib and trametinib. Enrolled subjects were administered dabrafenib 150 milligram (mg) orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily. Treatment continued until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, or study closure. After treatment discontinuation, subjects were followed for survival and disease progression as applicable.",

A primary analysis presented the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) data up to the data cut-off date of 23-Feb-2018. Based on these results, dabrafenib and trametinib combination was approved in the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the treatment of BRAF-mutation positive unresectable or metastatic melanoma. Data from Mainland Chinese subjects from 01-Jul-2019 onwards are not included due to local regulations in China.\n\nSubjects continued study treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study completion. After treatment discontinuation, subjects went into follow-up for survival and disease progression as applicable. Subjects could continue study treatment after disease progression if they achieved clinical response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or stable disease with tumour reduction; had no overt signs of toxicity; had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1 and did not require immediate surgical or radiological intervention.",
