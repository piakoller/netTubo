      "eligibility_criteria": "Main Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) (2009) Stage IV cutaneous melanoma or Stage III cutaneous, acral or mucosal melanoma that is judged inoperable. Patients with a history of uveal melanoma are not eligible.\n2. Measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as \\>20 mm with conventional techniques or as \\>10 mm with computerized tomography (CT) scan. Patients must have at least one measurable lesion by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and a separate lesion amenable to biopsy.\n3. Histologic proof of melanoma reviewed and confirmed by the enrolling site.\n4. Previous treatment with a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor with documented progression of disease on most recent CT scan.

Limited doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of reactive airway disease or to prevent IV contrast allergic reaction or anaphylaxis in patients who have known contrast allergies) are allowed.\n* Pregnant or breast-feeding women, due to the unknown effects of GI-6207 on the fetus or infant.\n* Serious inter-current medical illness which would interfere with the ability of the patient to carry out the treatment program.\n* Untreated brain metastases (or local treatment of brain metastases within the last 6 months) due to the poor prognosis of these patients and difficulty ascertaining the cause of neurologic toxicities.\n* Patients with pericardial masses \\>1 cm or thoracic lesions larger than 2 cm will be excluded.\n* Concurrent chemotherapy.\n* Chronic hepatitis infection, including B and C, because potential immune impairment caused by these disorders may diminish the effectiveness of this immunologic therapy.\n* Participation in another interventional clinical trial at the time of enrollment.\n* Any significant disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair the patient's tolerance of study treatment.\n* Significant dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.\n* Patients with second malignancy within 3 years of enrollment; patients treated surgically with a curative intent, such as non-melanoma skin cancers, localized kidney cancer or carcinoma in situ of the bladder, are not excluded. Patients with MEN2 and a history of pheochromocytoma will also not be excluded. In addition patients with prostate cancer who do not require systemic therapy will not be excluded. (A secondary, minor pathologic focus of another form of thyroid cancer may be coincidentally found in 15-20% of patients with medullary thyroid cancer. In such cases, eligibility is based on the discretion of the investigator.",

      "detailed_description": "RAD001 is a new drug that is designed to block a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. Octreotide Depot is FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome and hormonal symptoms from certain islet cell carcinomas. Octreotide Depot may also help to block certain proteins that are important in tumor growth.\n\nBefore you can start treatment on the study, you will have what are called \"screening tests\". These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. You will be asked questions about your medical history and about any medications you are currently taking or have taken in the past. You will have a complete physical exam and your heart rate, temperature, breathing rate, blood pressure, height, and weight will be measured. You will be asked about your ability to perform every day activities. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart) and scans (either Computed Tomography/CT or Magnetic Resonance Imaging/MRI) to evaluate the cancer. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.\n\nIf the screening evaluations show you are eligible to take part in the study, you may begin treatment. You will take RAD001 by mouth once a day, every day while on study. You should take it in a fasting state or after no more than a light, fat-free meal. You should take RAD001 about the same time each day. Octreotide Depot will be given as an injection into the muscle of either buttock once every 4 weeks while on study. This will be done at M. D. Anderson. Four weeks (28 days) is called one course of treatment.\n\nClinic visits will occur every 2 weeks during the first 4 weeks and every 4 weeks from then on. At each clinic visit, you will be asked questions about your medical history and about any medications you are currently taking or have taken in the past. You will have a complete physical exam and your heart rate, temperature, breathing rate, blood pressure, height, and weight will be measured. You will be asked about your ability to perform every day activities. Blood samples (about 1 teaspoons) for routine tests will be collected every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks. After that, blood samples (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected every 4 weeks. CT or MRI scan(s) will be performed every 12 weeks.\n\nIf a sample of your tumor tissue that was removed previously is available, it will be analyzed for expression of proteins that may effect tumor growth. However, if a sample is not available, you will not be asked to undergo a biopsy to collect this tissue. This sample may analyzed at any time during the study.\n\nIf you experience severe side effects, treatment may be delayed, stopped, or you may receive smaller doses of RAD001 and/or Octreotide Depot. You may continue to receive up to at least 12 courses of study treatment unless the disease gets worse, you decide not to take part any longer, or your doctor decides it is in your best interest to stop treatment. It may be possible to continue treatment beyond 12 courses if you are benefitting from this treatment.\n\nWhen you stop study treatment, you will be asked to have some tests and evaluations done. About 4 teaspoons of blood will be taken for routine lab tests, You will also have a physical exam and CT scan or MRI scan will be done to check the size and location of your disease.\n\nThis is an investigational study. RAD001 is investigational and is not commercially available. The drug combination in this study is also investigational. RAD001 is manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. About 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving pembrolizumab with standard chemotherapy, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and aldesleukin works in treating patients with melanoma that has spread to other areas of the body. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving an infusion of TIL, or white blood cells, may help stimulate the immune system to help kill more cells. Aldesleukin may also stimulate the white blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Giving pembrolizumab together with standard chemotherapy, TIL, and high- or low-dose aldesleukin may help stop the melanoma from spreading.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate the overall response rates of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) combined with lymphodepletion, TIL and high or low dose aldesleukin (interleukin-2) therapy in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Comparison of progression free survival between the treatment arms. II. Comparison of overall survival between the treatment arms. III. Comparison of deep tumor responses (defined as over 60% reduction in tumor burden) between the treatment arms as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.\n\nIV. Number of complete responses in both treatment arms. V. Safety evaluations by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Identification of biomarkers predictive of treatment response or failure through immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, gene expression changes as assessed by NanoString codeset, neo-antigen identification and complementary determining region (CDR)3 sequencing from blood and tumor samples acquired from baseline and on-treatment samples.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive standard lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising of cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -7 and -6 followed by fludarabine phosphate IV piggyback (IVPB) over 15-30 minutes on days -5 to -1. Patients also receive therapeutic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes IV over 15-60 minutes on day 0 followed by high-dose aldesleukin IV over 15 minutes every 8-16 hours for up to 15 doses on days 1-5. Beginning between 21-28 days after TIL infusion, patients receive maintenance therapy comprising of pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 21 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive standard lymphodepleting chemotherapy comprising of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine phosphate, and therapeutic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as in Arm I, followed approximately 6 hours later by low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) once per day (QD) for 14 days.

      "brief_summary": "This is a Phase II Evaluation of Docetaxel and Vinorelbine Plus Sargramostim in subjects who have metastatic melanoma which has advanced beyond the point at which local therapies such as surgery or radiation therapy would be helpful. Without effective treatment, metastatic melanoma is usually a severe and fatal disease. Chemotherapy agents or combinations of chemotherapy agents have produced tumor shrinkage in some patients, which has occasionally persisted. This research involves treatment with a combination of chemotherapy drugs known to be active against melanoma alone. The investigational purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of docetaxel, vinorelbine and sargramostim will produce a response (complete or partial) in metastasis melanoma. The researchers also wants to find out what side effects are associated with this combination of drugs.",
      "detailed_description": "Annually in the U.S. there is an estimated 40,000 new cases of malignant melanoma and 7000 deaths. This disease is becoming more common with its incidence increasing at a more rapid rate in the past decade than that of any other cancer except lung cancer in women. Metastatic disease responds poorly to the usual treatments with only 2 out of 30 drugs tested, DTIC and nitrosoureas, showing response rates greater than 10%. Complete responses are rare.\n\nMetastatic melanoma is a disease with few therapeutic options. Multi-agent chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP), Dacarbazine (DTIC), Carmustine (BCNU), with or without Tamoxifen, offers a 20% response rate but has failed to consistently demonstrate a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) when compared to a single agent DTIC.\n\nRecently, investigators, in an effort to combine the activity of biologic response modifiers with chemotherapy, have developed combination biochemotherapy for metastatic melanoma. Legha et al reported an overall objective response rate of 64% with a 5-day biochemotherapy regimen. O'Day et al reported similar results (overall response rate of 57%) using a modified 5-day biochemotherapy regimen.\n\nThe above regimens all have significant toxicities and modest response rates. Clearly, more effective less toxic regimens are needed.\n\nVinorelbine tartrate (Navelbine) and Docetaxel (Taxotere) have both shown activity against melanoma. Additionally, the combination of both drugs has shown enhanced activity against melanoma.",

      "detailed_description": "This study is for children with malignant melanoma and high risk features (at high risk of melanoma returning or spreading to other parts of the body) or who have recurrent disease. The study has two treatment groups based on the stage of the disease. Patients with stage IIC, IIIA or IIIB melanoma whose tumors have been removed by surgery will be treated in study group A. These patients will receive 4 weeks of high dose interferon alfa-2b followed by 48 weeks of peginterferon. Patients with stage IIIC or IV melanoma, stage III melanoma that could not be removed by surgery and those with recurrent disease will be treated in study group B. These patients will receive peginterferon alfa-2b and temozolomide.\n\nStratum A: Resected Stages IIC, IIIA, and IIIB patients\n\nInduction therapy (weeks 1-4): Subjects will receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b 20 million units/m2 per day intravenously over 20-30 minutes on 5 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks. Subjects will receive peginterferon alfa-2b 1 mcg/kg/week subcutaneously for a total of 48 weeks.\n\nStratum B: Resected Stage IIIC, unresectable Stage III, Stage IV, and recurrent patients\n\nStratum B is divided into 2 groups based on the presence (Stratum B1) or absence (Stratum B2) of measurable disease. Subjects will receive 8 weekly doses of peginterferon alfa-2b 0.5 mcg/kg/dose subcutaneously in combination with temozolomide 75mg/m2/dose by mouth daily for 6 weeks followed by 2 week break. The duration of each treatment course will be 8 weeks. Strata B2 (no measurable disease) will proceed with 7 courses as outlined.\n\nSurgery interventions -Associated with both Strata A and B Surgery description: All subjects with initial presentation of melanoma (T1-4) will be treated with primary wide local excision with a minimum of 1cm margin (if anatomically feasible) surrounding the primary lesion or biopsy scar. For lesions with Breslow's thickness of \\> 1mm or \\<or= with ulceration or Clark's level IV/V, a 2 cm margin is preferred when anatomically feasible. Subjects with sentinel lymph node(s) positive for disease, will undergo complete lymph node dissection of the involved nodal basin.\n\nAdditional objectives include:\n\n* To assess the safety of temozolomide administered in combination with peginterferon α-2b to pediatric patients with resected AJCC Stage IIIC, unresectable Stage III, metastatic, or recurrent cutaneous melanoma (Stratum B).\n* To study the feasibility and safety of administering peginterferon α-2b weekly for 48 weeks following an initial induction phase with intravenous high dose interferon α-2b for 4 weeks to pediatric patients with resected thick melanomas (\\> 4mm) with ulcerations (AJCC Stage IIC) and resected melanomas with regional lymph node metastases (AJCC Stage IIIA and IIIB) (Stratum A).",

The primary objectives of this study were to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. The secondary objectives were to assess the objective response rate, KW2871 pharmacokinetics (PK), and other exploratory immunology as indicated (e.g., development of human anti-chimeric antibodies \\[HACA\\], activity of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity \\[ADCC\\] and complement-dependent cytotoxicity \\[CDC\\] in peripheral blood, number and functional state of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and expression of GD3 in immune and tumor cells of tumor biopsies, and markers of interferon \\[IFN\\] response/resistance and markers of resistance to ADCC/CDC in peripheral blood mononuclear cells \\[PBMCs\\]).",
      "detailed_description": "Eligible patients were sequentially enrolled into dose-escalating cohorts to receive KW2871 intravenously (IV) once every 2 weeks starting on Day 3 of Week 1 at the following doses: 5 mg/m\\^2 in Cohort 1, 10 mg/m\\^2 in Cohort 2, and 20 mg/m\\^2 in Cohort 3. HDI was administered concurrently at a dose of 20 million units (MU)/m\\^2 IV once daily (QD) for 5 consecutive days per week for 4 weeks (induction phase), followed by 10 MU/m\\^2 administered subcutaneously (SC) 3 times per week (maintenance phase). Patients received KW2871 and HDI combination therapy until disease progression requiring treatment intervention that would have interfered with the interpretation of the study results.\n\nInitially, 3 patients were enrolled within a cohort and evaluated for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and regimen-limiting toxicity (RLT) for the first 8 weeks of study treatment. If 1 of 3 patients experienced an RLT, the cohort was expanded to 6 patients. Escalation to the next higher dose cohort proceeded if the RLT rate was \\<33% (0/3 or 1/6 patients) in a given cohort. The combination treatment was considered safe if ≤ 20% patients experienced RLT.\n\nDLT was defined as any adverse event (AE) that required reduction of the HDI dose or discontinuation of KW2871. RLT was defined as an HDI-related DLT that required more than 2 dose reductions of HDI during the induction phase or the first 4 weeks of the maintenance phase, or any KW2871- or regimen-related DLT.",

      "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the immunization effects of a vaccine for patients who are at risk for recurrence of their skin cancer. That is, the risk of cancer is higher if melanoma has invaded deep into the skin or lymph nodes. Currently, the only therapy that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for preventing recurrence of melanoma is alpha-interferon. But the research data are controversial. In this study, the vaccine to be used, called gp100, contains a piece of a protein called a peptide, which melanoma cancer cells produce.\n\nPatients 16 and older who have had confirmed melanoma surgically removed and whose tissue type is tested as being human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A serotype group (HLA-A2), through a specific blood test, may be eligible for this study.\n\nUp to 132 participants will be enrolled. There will be a physical examination and collection of blood samples for tests, and making sure that x-rays and scans are current. Patients will be randomly assigned to four groups. Group 1 will receive the peptide with an adjuvant (assistant) oil-based liquid called Montanide ISA-51, as an injection in the thigh. Group 2 will receive gp100, Montanide, and a cream called imiquimod, which the FDA has approved for treating genital warts and herpes but that may help immune cells in the skin to recognize the vaccine. Imiquimod will be applied to the skin for 5 days. Group 3 will receive gp100 mixed in salt water given as several mini-doses under the skin of the thigh. Group 4 will also receive several mini-doses of gp100 mixed in saline, as well as imiquimod cream applied to the skin for 5 days. All patients will receive the gp100 every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Every dose is a cycle, with four cycles considered a course of therapy. If the melanoma does not return or patients do not experience side effects from this therapy, then the courses of vaccine will repeated for up to 12 cycles of therapy (3 courses over 33 weeks). Side effects of the peptide vaccination include local swelling, swelling of local lymph nodes, bruising, and pain and redness at the injection sites. There may be chills or fever. Patients will be watched closely for such side effects.\n\nTo study how the vaccine changes the action of cells in the immune system, patients' white blood cells (lymphocytes) will be obtained, involving a separate informed consent. The procedure, called leukaphersis, requires inserting a needle into the arm, to obtain blood going into a machine, which divides the blood into red cells, plasma (or the serum part), and lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are removed, and the plasma and red cells returned to the patient through a second needle in the other arm. Risks associated with the procedure include fainting, which can be prevented by patients' eating before coming to the lab, and bleeding and infection at the needle site. Patients will undergo leukapheresis will be done about four times: before receiving the vaccine, 3 weeks after the first four doses, and then after 8 cycles and 12 cycles. Patients assigned to the groups receiving imiquimod will be asked to record every time they apply that cream and describe any symptoms developed during the study. All patients will be watched closely for any sign that their melanoma has returned. Before and throughout the study, multiple blood tests will be conducted.\n\nThe vaccine, Montanide, and imiquimod may increase patients' immune system in fighting off new tumors, but that is not known now. However, the study may provide information that will be useful in treating melanoma patients in the future.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nA previous clinical trial has been conducted in the Surgery Branch National Cancer Institute (NCI) in which gp100 immunizations have been administered to patients with melanoma in the adjuvant setting. In this prior protocol, the peptide emulsified in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant was administered subcutaneously using several different schedules and was well tolerated except for mild and transient erythema at the site of injection. Each of the schedules provided successful immunization although the q3w schedule was the best tolerated locally and three courses of immunization appeared to be sufficient using this regimen. An important finding from the adjuvant protocol however was the significant increase in immune precursors specifically reactive against peptide and tumor that occurred with increasing courses of immunization. These findings have encouraged us to now further explore the optimal methods for generating immune precursors using the gp100:209-217(210M) peptide by testing the impact of an additional immune adjuvant, imiquimod, reported to increase the immunizing potential of antigens as well as evaluate an alternate route of injection, intradermal administration.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the immunologic activity of immunization with four different preparations of the gp100:209-217(210M) melanoma antigen peptide and potentially select one for further study.\n\nEligibility:\n\nHLA-A 0201 patients, age greater than or equal 16 years, with primary melanomas with lesions that are ulcerated and greater than or equal 2mm, or any lesions that are greater than or equal 4.0 mm in thickness, or greater than or equal 1 positive lymph node, or local recurrence, or resected metastatic disease, within 6 months of surgical resection will be considered. Patients who have ocular or mucosal melanoma or who require systemic steroid therapy will be excluded. The following patients will also be excluded: have previously been immunized with gp100; have known hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study; have previously received chemotherapy for treatment of melanoma; or who are undergoing or have undergone in the past 3 weeks any systemic therapy except surgery for their cancer.\n\nDesign:\n\nPatients will be randomized into one of the following four arms:\n\n1. gp100:209-217(210M) peptide emulsified in MONTANIDE ISA-51 or Montanide ISA 51 VG injected subcutaneously on day one every three weeks (1 cycle) for a total of twelve cycles (33 weeks).\n2. gp100:209-217(210M) peptide emulsified in MONTANIDE ISA-51 or Montanide ISA 51 VG injected subcutaneously on day one every three weeks (1 cycle) for a total of twelve cycles (33 weeks); following the injection patients will apply imiquimod to the skin at the site of injection daily for 5 days.\n3. gp100:209-217(210M) in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection injected intradermally on day one every three weeks (1 cycle) for a total of twelve cycles (33 weeks).\n4. gp100:209-217(210M) peptide in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection injected intradermally on day one every three weeks (1 cycle) for a total of twelve cycles (33 weeks); following the injection patients will apply imiquimod to the skin at the site of the injection daily for 5 days.\n\nImmunizations will be administered on an outpatient basis unless side effects or the patient's clinical condition warrants hospitalization. Patients will receive full clinical evaluation three weeks after 8 cycles and 12 cycles.\n\nEach of the arms will be conducted using a two-stage optimal design Since the primary objective is to select one regimen from among the four on the basis of the immune response, this design allows there to be greater than 80% probability of correctly selecting the superior arm if there is either a tie in the number of immune responses, or if there is at least one more immune response on one arm than the other three arms, and if the true response rates are 15%, 15%, 15% and 35%. Initially, 19 patients will be enrolled in each arm and evaluated; if 0 to 3 of 19 in an arm have an immune response to T2 cells pulsed with 0.01 M peptide after the 4th, 8th, and 12th cycles, no further patients would be randomized to receive the peptide on that arm. If at least four immunologic responses are noted after the 8th cycle, then accrual to 33 patients would take place. If all four arms need to be completed and 33 patients need to be completed in each arm, a total of 132 patients are required.",

Correcting immune dysfunction in advanced-stage melanoma patients using tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib is proposed to relicense the patient's immune system to respond optimally to specific immunization. The integration of antigens expressed by tumor-associated blood vessel cells provides a means to selectively target the genetically-/antigenically-heterogeneous population of tumor cells in the advanced-stage melanoma patient.\n\nThis is a single-center, prospective randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the activity, safety and immune effects of dasatinib given in combination with an autologous type-1 polarized Dendritic Cell (αDC1) vaccine. The current trial represents a randomized Phase 2 study to determine the activity and safety of intradermal (id) administration of αDC1s loaded with a mixture of six TBVA-derived peptides at the time of, or immediately after, an initial therapy cycle with the TKI dasatinib.\n\nDasatinib will be administered at the standard dose and schedule recommended by the FDA (70 mg BID). The autologous type-I DC vaccine will be administered either prior to, or concomitant with, the initiation of dasatinib administration. All patients will receive dasatinib at a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily by mouth in the outpatient setting approximately every 12 hours, at the same time each day.\n\nThe DC vaccine will be administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10e7 cells, with all the DCs being administered on days 1 and 15 of every cycle on an outpatient basis in the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Research Center (UPCI-CTRC).\n\nPatients on Arm A will start dasatinib administration on cycle 2, day 1 (week 5), while those patients in Arm B will start dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (week 1).\n\nMen and women at least 18 years of age must be HLA-A2+ and have histologically confirmed melanoma that is metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable Stage IIIB/C and for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.\n\nNote: The outcome measures and time frames (previously) described in the PRS protocol record have been revised and articulated in the results section, to more accurately describe and represent the stated per-protocol investigations and endpoints, quantitatively.",

Phase I studies in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, rheumatoid arthritis, and lymphoma have demonstrated safety with a continuous dosing schedule, and a maximum tolerated dose has been established.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To test an experimental drug called R935788 (fostamatinib disodium) for its ability to stop cancer growth signals, thus slowing the growth of cancer cells in laboratory testing.\n* To determine the clinical response of R935788 administered orally twice a day on a continuous schedule in patients with colorectal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, follicular or papillary thyroid cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular, carcinoma of the head and neck, and renal cell carcinoma.\n* To evaluate the effects, safety, and biochemical response of R935788 therapy.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients with colorectal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, follicular or papillary thyroid cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (excluding squamous cell histology), hepatocellular cancer, carcinoma of the head and neck, and renal cell carcinoma whose disease has progressed after any therapy or who have no acceptable standard treatment options.\n* Patients must have recovered from toxicities of prior therapies to at least eligibility levels.\n* Patients who have received radiation or chemotherapy within 4 weeks of study enrollment are not eligible.\n* Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Researchers will conduct the following tests and procedures during the study:\n\n  * Clinic visits with a physical exam, including vital signs and blood pressure, every other week during cycle 1, and once a month starting with cycle 2.\n  * Blood will be drawn weekly during cycle 1, every other week during cycle 2, and once a month starting with cycle 3; urine tests will be conducted depending on results of blood tests.\n  * Imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans (a series of x-rays) or ultrasound (an examination using sound waves), will be done every 8 weeks while the patient is receiving R935788.\n* R935788 will be administered orally twice a day for 28 days (one cycle). Imaging studies will be obtained every two cycles. Patients will fill in a diary to show when they took the medication and to note any side effects. The 28-day treatment cycle will be repeated as long as the patient is tolerating R935788 and the cancer is either stable or getting better.\n* Researchers will conduct the following additional tests to see how the study is affecting the patient:\n\n  * Other research blood samples will be collected before treatment, at cycle 1 week 3, at the beginning of cycle 2, and at 8 weeks.\n  * Optional tumor biopsies will be requested before starting treatment, at cycle 1 day 28.\n  * Patients with specific lesions or tumors may be asked for an optional tumor biopsy on day 8.",
      "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND\n\n* R935788 (fostamatanib disodium) is a kinase inhibitor with activity in vitro against several kinases known to be mutated or aberrantly expressed in malignant cells.\n* Anticancer drugs that target multiple kinases are of particular interest because tumors may rely on several different kinase pathways for survival.\n* R935788 has shown promising activity in the NCI 60-cell line panel against colon cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma cell lines, as well as in two renal cell xenograft models. R935788 is orally absorbed in tumor-bearing mice at concentrations that achieve antitumor activity and are not associated with observable toxicity.\n* Phase I studies in patients with immune thrombocytopenic purpura, rheumatoid arthritis and lymphoma have demonstrated safety with a continuous dosing schedule, and a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n* To determine the clinical response of R935788 administered orally twice a day on a continuous schedule in patients with colorectal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, follicular, medullary, or papillary thyroid cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, carcinoma of the head and neck, and renal cell carcinoma.\n* To evaluate the safety of R935788 in patients with various solid tumors.\n* To determine the effects of R935788 on circulating tumor cells, circulating endothelial cells and levels of phosphorylated AKT and extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) in tumor samples.\n* To evaluate the biochemical response to R935788 therapy in patients with thyroid malignancies and pheochromocytoma.\n\nELIGIBILITY\n\n* Patients with histologically documented pheochromocytoma, follicular, medullary, or papillary thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma (excluding squamous cell histology), hepatocellular carcinoma, carcinoma of the head and neck, as well as renal cell carcinoma) whose disease has progressed after any therapy or who have no acceptable standard treatment options.\n* Radiation or chemotherapy is not permitted within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment.\n* Patients must have recovered from toxicities of prior therapies to at least eligibility levels.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\n\n-This is an open-label, Phase II study of R935788. Patients will receive R935788 orally twice a day in 28-day cycles without interruption. Imaging studies will be obtained every 2 cycles. Following a limited dose escalation portion in each stratum, a two stage design will be used, the initial stage of which will consist of 15 to 21 patients depending on tumor type in each of 7 strata.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* 3.1.1 Subjects must have histologically documented solid tumors: pheochromocytoma, follicular or papillary thyroid, colorectal, non-small cell lung (excluding squamous cell histology), hepatocellular, head and neck or renal cell origin, whose disease has progressed after any number of prior therapies or who have no acceptable standard treatment options.\n* Patients with follicular or papillary thyroid cancer will be eligible if they have metastatic or unresectable, locally advanced disease which is refractory to, or not suitable for, I therapy.\n* Diagnosis of malignancy must be confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology at the Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH), prior to patient enrollment.\n* 3.1.2 Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than or equal to 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan.\n* 3.1.3 Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.\n* 3.1.4 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2 (Karnofsky greater than or equal to 60%).\n* 3.1.5 Subjects must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n* absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL\n* platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mcL\n* total bilirubin within less than or equal to 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* aspartate aminotransferase (AST) serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase(SGOT),alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase(SGPT) less than or equal to 2.5 times ULN\n* creatinine \\< 1.5 times ULN\n\nOR\n\n* creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 for patients with creatinine levels greater than or equal to 1.5 times institutional upper limit of normal.\n* 3.1.6 The effects of R935788 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 1 month after discontinuation of the study. Women of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test in order to be eligible. Should a participant or a participant's partner become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, the participant should inform the Research Team immediately.\n* 3.1.7 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n* 3.1.8 Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of R935788 in patients \\< 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but may be eligible for future pediatric Phase I trials.\n* 3.1.9 Patients with diagnosis of hypertension should have their blood pressure adequately controlled by medical therapy (adequate control of hypertension for the purposes of this trial is defined as systolic blood pressure \\< 150 mmHg or diastolic pressure \\< 90 mmHg).\n* 3.1.10 Patients with head and neck cancer who are unable to swallow and who are gastrostomy tube (G-tube) dependent will have the tablets dissolved in water or orange juice followed by a free water or orange juice flush.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* 3.2.1 Subjects who have had chemotherapy, biotherapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study, or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior therapy.\n* A time period of greater than or equal to 2 weeks must have elapsed since a patient was administered any investigational agent as part of a Phase 0 study (also referred to as an early Phase I study or pre-Phase I study where a sub-therapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the principal investigator's (PI's) discretion, and patients should have recovered from any toxicity from prior therapy to eligibility levels.\n* 3.2.2 Patients must not have other current malignancies, other than basal cell skin cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast.\n* Patients who have undergone primary therapy for a prior diagnosis of cancer and are disease free for at least 3 years prior to study entry will be included in the trial.\n* 3.2.3 Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n* 3.2.4 Subjects with known brain metastases are excluded with the exception of those whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 3 months since treatment of the brain metastases without steroids (except for maintenance replacement doses) or antiseizure medications.\n* Patients cannot be taking enzyme-inducing anti-seizure medications (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, oxcarbamazepine); other seizure medications that are not considered enzyme-inducing would be permissible.\n* 3.2.5 Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to exposure to this agent, women who are breast feeding are ineligible for this study.\n* 3.2.6 Patients receiving medications known to induce/inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) will be excluded from this study.\n* Patients who must initiate treatment with a CYP3A4 inhibitor while receiving R935788 will be carefully monitored.\n* Inhibitors of CYP3A4 include but are not limited to:\n* amiodarone,\n* clarithromycin,\n* erythromycin,\n* imatinib,\n* troleandomycin,\n* ritonavir,\n* indinavir,\n* fluconazole,\n* itraconazole,\n* and ketoconazole.\n* Patients should also avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice during participation in the study.\n* Patients will also be required to keep a study diary to record any side effects that occur during the study and any other medications taken.\n* 3.2.7 Subjects with clinically significant illnesses which would compromise participation in the study, including, but not limited to: unstable or serious medical conditions (ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure \\[AHA Class II or worse\\], unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements) are excluded due to the possibility that the underlying condition may obscure the attribution of effect and adverse events with respect to the study medication and may limit study compliance.\n* 3.2.8 Patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) may have underlying chronic infectious hepatitis as long as there is no evidence of hepatic failure and they meet the eligibility criteria.\n* 3.2.9 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with R935788.",

Patients will receive one dose of IMC-A12 intravenously once every 3 weeks at the Clinical Center. During the Clinical Center visits, researchers will perform study tests and procedures to see how the study drugs are affecting the body.\n* Patients will undergo a number of tests and procedures during the treatment cycle, including physical examinations, blood and urine samples for standard tests, imaging studies (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans) to evaluate tumor growth, and blood and urine samples to evaluate the amount of IMC-A12 in the body.\n* Patients may continue to take the drug as long as there are no adverse side effects and as long as the tumor does not grow.",

      "eligibility_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Histologically confirmation of invasive recurrent or metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma by the pathology department / Center for Cancer Research (CCR) / National Cancer Institute (NCI), or the pathology department of participating institutions.\n* Patients must have had at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen. There is no limit to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received. Progressive disease should have been documented before entry into the study.\n* Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as greater than 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than 10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n* Target lesions cannot be selected within previously irradiated areas, if not newly arising or clearly progressing after irradiation as proven by repeat scanning.\n* Patients must have recovered from toxicity related to prior therapy to at least to grade 1 (defined by CTCAE 3.0 until December 31, 2010, and by CTCAE 4.0 beginning January 1, 2011) and must not have had major surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy (including any investigational agents), or hormonal therapy (other than replacement), within 4 weeks prior to entering the study.\n* Concurrent corticosteroids for myasthenia gravis, or other paraneoplastic syndromes which often accompany thymic malignancies are allowed. Inhaled steroids are also allowed. However since steroids might occasionally induce responses in thymic malignancies patients should be on a stable dose of steroids for greater than or equal to 8 weeks before enrollment in order not to confound the efficacy assessment.\n* Age greater than 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of IMC-A12 in patients less than 16 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 1 single-agent trials.\n* Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.\n* Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function (as defined below). Patients must have returned to baseline or grade 1 from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy:\n\n  * leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mm\\^3\n  * absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm\\^3\n  * hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL\n  * platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm\\^3\n  * total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(SGOT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(SGPT) less than or equal to 3 times the institutional ULN\n\n    (5x if LFT elevations due to liver metastases)\n  * creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional ULN\n\nOR\n\n--creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n\n* Patients may be transfused to obtain a hemoglobin of 9.0.\n* The patient must have fasting serum glucose less than 120 mg/dL or below the institutional ULN\n* The effects of IMC-A12 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study therapy and for 3 months after the last dose of IMC-A12. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to comply with intravenous administration schedule, and the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nINCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:\n\nBoth men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Every effort will be made to recruit women and minorities in this study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 3 months without steroids may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.\n* Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate, provided their blood glucose is within the normal range (fasting less than 120 mg/dL or below institutional upper limit of normal) and if they are on a stable dietary or therapeutic regimen for this condition.\n* Uncontrolled medical illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or uncontrolled, symptomatic congestive heart failure (American Heart Association (AHA) Class II or worse), uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients with poorly controlled viral loads (viral load greater than 50 copies HIV/ml), and/or AIDS-defining illnesses will be excluded due to the possibility that IMC-A12 may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events with respect to IMC-A12. HIV positive patients with thymic malignancies not meeting the above criteria can be considered for inclusion in the study.\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n* History of another invasive malignancy in the last five years. Adequately treated non-invasive, non-melanoma skin cancers, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, and surgically-removed papillary thyroid cancer will be allowed.\n* Prior treatment with drugs of the IGF-1R inhibitor class.\n* Patients with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy as assessed by the investigator.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because IMC-A12 is a monoclonal antibody to IGF-1R with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. IgG antibody may also potentially be secreted in milk and therefore breastfeeding women should be excluded.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to IMC-A12.",

To assess patient reported quality of life using EuroQol Five-Dimensional Five Level Scale Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G).\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. For patients with secretory tumors, to examine changes in plasma metanephrine levels and urinary catecholamine and/or metanephrine levels.\n\nII. For patients with secretory tumors, to examine whether lenvatinib-induced changes in plasma metanephrines and urinary catecholamine and/or metanephrine levels during the first cycle of treatment may be associated with objective tumor response.\n\nIII. To examine associations between tumor response and somatic mutational status in archived tumors, or germline mutational status (presence of SDHD, SDHB, RET, VHL, neurofibromatosis type-1).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive lenvatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

      "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Cyclophosphamide may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving vaccine therapy together with cyclophosphamide after surgery may cause a stronger immune response to kill any remaining tumor cells. It may also prevent or delay the recurrence of melanoma.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy when given with or without cyclophosphamide and to see how well they work in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II, stage III, or stage IV melanoma.",

      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "phase": "PHASE2",
      "condition": "Melanoma (Skin)",
      "intervention": "bevacizumab; carboplatin; everolimus; paclitaxel",
      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial is studying how well carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab work when given with or without everolimus in treating patients with malignant melanoma that has spread from where it started to other places in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy given together with bevacizumab is more effective with or without everolimus in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.",
      "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\n* To assess whether there is sufficient promise of an impact of the addition of everolimus to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab on progression-free survival that it would be recommended for further testing in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.\n\nSecondary\n\n* To estimate the confirmed tumor response rate of each of the treatment regimens.\n* To estimate the distribution of overall survival (OS) time for each of the treatment regimens.\n* To assess the impact on the safety profile of the addition of everolimus to the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to elevated LDH (above upper limit of normal) at baseline (yes vs no), location of metastatic disease (M1a \\[skin, subcutaneous tissue, or lymph node only\\] vs M1b \\[lung\\] vs M1c \\[other visceral sites\\]) and prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin as in Arm I. Patients also receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) 3 times weekly. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 5 years.",

      "status": "COMPLETED",

      "condition": "Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma; Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2A; Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2B",
      "intervention": "Vandetanib",
      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n* Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is common in people with a genetic disorder called multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN).\n* Vandetanib is an experimental drug that blocks a defective protein receptor (rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor) found on the surface of cancer cells in people with MEN. It is thought that this protein is a primary cause of MTC in people with MEN.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To study the activity of Vandetanib in children and adolescents with MEN-related MTC by measuring the change in tumor size, in blood levels of proteins produced the tumor (calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and in tumor-related diarrhea.\n* To determine the safety and tolerability of Vandetanib in children and adolescents.\n* To study how the body handles Vandetanib in children and adolescents.\n* To determine the effect of Vandetanib on the survival of children and adolescents with MTC.\n\nEligibility:\n\n-Children and adolescents 5 to 18 years of age with MTC whose tumor cannot be surgically removed or has grown back after treatment or has metastasized (spread beyond the thyroid gland).\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients take Vandetanib once a day in 28-day cycles. The first patients enrolled in the study are started on a low dose of Vandetanib to determine tolerability.\n* Patients have periodic blood tests, electrocardiograms, and blood pressure measurements to look for side effects of Vandetanib.\n* Blood tests and imaging scans (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), bone and octreoscan) are done every 8 weeks for the first 32 weeks of treatment and then every 16 weeks for the duration of the treatment period.\n* Patients who have tumor-related diarrhea keep a daily record of the number and consistency of bowel movements.",
      "detailed_description": "BACKGROUND:\n\nHereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), which is a rare calcitonin-producing tumor arising from the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid, is often a manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 2A and 2B and can be detected in children as young as five years in MEN 2A and one year in those with MEN 2B\n\nMEN results from an activating mutation in the rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene resulting in a constitutively activated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)\n\nVandetanib is an orally bioavailable multi-RTK inhibitor that blocks the mutant RET gene product and has anti-tumor activity in adults with hereditary MTC\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n\nTo assess the activity of vandetanib in children and adolescents with hereditary MTC using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (primary endpoint), tumor biomarkers and tumor-related diarrhea\n\nTo assess the safety and tolerance of vandetanib in children and adolescents at a dose equivalent to the recommended dose in adults\n\nTo assess the pharmacokinetics of vandetanib at steady state in children and adolescents\n\nSecondary objectives include monitoring progression-free and overall survival, assessing RET, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR) and somatostatin receptor expression in archival tumor tissue, assessing changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mutations in RET in tumor tissue vs germ line in PBMC and after treatment; assessing gene expression and gains/losses of DNA in tumor tissue at baseline, during treatment and at the time of progression; establishment of pediatric MTC cell lines sensitive and resistant cells lines in vitro\n\nELIGIBILITY:\n\nChildren and adolescents 5 to 18 years of age (inclusive) with unresectable, recurrent or metastatic hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma\n\nMeasurable disease by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)\n\nDESIGN:\n\nVandetanib will be administered as a once daily dose, continuously (1 cycle equals 28 days) at a dose of 150 mg,m(2), per day\n\nTo ensure the safety of the adult dose in children and adolescents, a limited intra-patient dose escalation will be performed in the initial cohort of patients, with older patients (13 to18 yrs) being studied before younger patients (5 to12 yrs)\n\nPatients wil be enrolled at a dose of 100mg, m(2), per day (180 mg per day in adults) for two 28 day cycles and escalated to 150 mg, m(2), per day (270 mg, per day in adults) on cycle 3, if dose limiting toxicity was not observed at the lower dose. If the 150mg, m(2), per day dose level is tolerable on cycles 3 and 4, all subsequent patients will be enrolled at this dose level\n\nPharmacokinetics of vandetanib will be studied at steady state at the end of cycle 2 and trough levels will be obtained prior to the second dose on cycle 1, and on day 1 of cycles 2-5.\n\nResponsible of measurable tumors will be assessed by RECIST. Biomarker and clinical response will also be monitored.

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase III trial studies sargramostim or vaccine therapy alone to see how well they work compared to sargramostim and vaccine therapy together in preventing disease recurrence in patients with melanoma that has been removed by surgery. Sargramostim may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether yeast derived sargramostim and vaccine therapy are more effective alone or together in preventing recurrence of melanoma.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with completely resected stage IV melanoma or stage III melanoma with gross extranodal extension, satellites, and/or intransit lesions, treated with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (sargramostim) vs. no GM-CSF, or other high risk patients listed in the eligibility section.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare, using a 2 x 2 factorial design, overall survival and disease-free survival of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 positive patients treated with peptide vaccination vs. no peptide vaccination.\n\nII. The following descriptive evaluations of survival and disease-free survival are planned for the HLA-A2 positive patients: (1) GM-CSF plus peptide vaccination vs. peptide vaccination alone; (2) GM-CSF plus peptide vaccination vs. GM-CSF alone; (3) GM-CSF plus peptide vaccination vs. placebo.\n\nIII. Survival and disease-free survival of HLA-A2 positive patients not receiving peptide vaccination will be compared to that of HLA-A2 negative patients not receiving peptide vaccination.\n\nIV. To determine the influence of GM-CSF on circulating dendritic cell numbers and subpopulations in peripheral blood of patients receiving and not receiving GM-CSF.\n\nV. To determine, in HLA-A2 positive patients, whether immunization with peptides with or without GM-CSF elicits a measurable T-cell response as assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) tetramer assay, and to determine the functionality of these cells by intracellular cytokine staining.\n\nOUTLINE: HLA-A2 positive patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment regimens (Arms I-IV). HLA-A2 negative patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (Arms V-VI).\n\nARM I: Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-14 and peptide vaccine comprising tyrosinase, gp100 antigen, and MART-1 antigen mixed with either incomplete Freund's adjuvant or Montanide ISA-51 VG SC on days 1 and 15 (course 1) and day 1 (course 2 and subsequent courses).\n\nARM II: Patients receive sargramostim placebo SC on days 1-14 and peptide vaccine comprising tyrosinase, gp100 antigen, and MART-1 antigen mixed with either incomplete Freund's adjuvant or Montanide ISA-51 VG SC on days 1 and 15 (course 1) and day 1 (course 2 and subsequent courses).\n\nARM III: Patients receive sargramostim SC on days 1-14 and peptide placebo mixed with either incomplete Freund's adjuvant or Montanide ISA-51 VG SC on days 1 and 15 (course 1) and day 1 (course 2 and subsequent courses).\n\nARM IV: Patients receive sargramostim placebo SC on days 1-14 and peptide placebo mixed with either incomplete Freund's adjuvant or Montanide ISA-51 VG SC on days 1 and 15 (course 1) and day 1 (course 2 and subsequent courses).\n\nARM V: Patients receive sargramostim SC on days 1-14.\n\nARM VI: Patients receive sargramostim placebo SC on days 1-14.\n\nIn all arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nIn the event of recurrence, patients who undergo complete resection of the recurrence may continue treatment for 6 courses or until completion of 1 year of therapy (whichever is longer). For patients with recurrence that is not surgically resectable or experiencing second recurrence, treatment will be discontinued.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months for 10 years.",

These studies will be obtained with the long term goal of submitting a New Drug Application (NDA) for FDA approval of 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT in adults and children.\n\nProject Design\n\n68Ga-DOTATOC Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for Diagnosis, Staging, and Measurement of Response to Treatment in Somatostatin Receptor Positive Tumors is a prospective, Phase 1-2, single center, open-label study in subjects with known or suspected somatostatin receptor positive tumor. Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment. Study participants will receive 68Ga-DOTATOC and undergo a PET/CT imaging study with an option to receive a second 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT if they begin a new treatment (surgery, hepatic embolization, Sandostatin LAR, chemotherapy, targeted biological therapy, or peptide receptor radiotherapy) within 30 days of the first scan. The second scan will be performed at a time recommended by the treating physician as optimal interval to observe results from treatment.\n\nProject Goal\n\nThis study is planned to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of \\[68Ga\\]-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (\\[68Ga\\]-DOTATOC) as an accurate imaging technique for diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of response to treatment in patients with Somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.\n\nNeuroendocrine tumors are solid malignant tumors that arise from dispersed neuroendocrine cells found throughout the body. Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) can be divided into two groups: Carcinoid tumors that may arise from the lungs, stomach, small bowel or colon and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (also known as pancreatic islet cell tumors). The clinical behavior of NETs is extremely variable; some may cause hormone hypersecretion and others may not, the majority of them are slow-growing tumors (well-differentiated NETs), whereas some NETs are highly aggressive (poorly differentiated NETs). The incidence of NETs is increasing, from 1.1/100,000 per year in 1973 to 5.3/100,000 per year in 20041. Among NETs, 25% have distant metastases and 25% have regional involvement at the time of initial diagnosis\\[1\\]. Other tumors that express high levels of somatostatin receptors include neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing's sarcoma\\[2-4\\].\n\nThe radiological detection and staging of these tumors is challenging and requires a multimodality approach. Somatostatin receptor imaging with In-111 Pentetreotide (OctreoScan) and multiphase CT are the most commonly used modalities although the use of endoscopic ultrasound and MRI is also increasing. Surgery is the only curative option for NETs. However, curative surgery in malignant NET is possible in less than 30% of patients with recurrence identified in the majority of patients as late as 15 years after initial surgery. Treatment with somatostatin analogs, which include the short acting subcutaneous and long acting release (LAR) octreotide, are effective in stabilizing NETs and have been recently demonstrated to prolong the time to progression of disease\\[5\\]. Chemotherapy is generally not effective in low grade NETs, but it may be helpful in high grade and pancreatic NETs. On the other hand, neuroblastoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing's sarcoma are initially responsive to chemotherapy, but relapses are common and salvage therapies are not very effective, resulting in \\<30% overall survival at 5 years\\[6-8\\].\n\nSomatostatin Receptor Targeted Imaging and Therapy\n\nTumors that express somatostatin receptors can be targeted with radiolabeled somatostatin analogues for imaging and treatment. Somatostatin receptor gamma camera imaging with In-111 DTPA-octreotide (OctreoScan) targeting somatostatin receptor 2 (sstr2), is used routinely for imaging of neuroendocrine tumors with a detection rate \\>90% for well-differentiated carcinoid tumors and majority of pancreatic NETs, but only a 50% detection rate for insulinomas, which may show a weaker expression of sstr2\\[9\\].\n\nGiven the clinical efficacy of this radiolabeled peptide as a diagnostic agent, studies to test if therapeutic radiation could be targeted to tumors in a similar manner was a logical next step. Attempts to utilize In-111 DTPA Octreotide as a therapeutic agent have been minimally effective due to short range of auger electrons utilized in this therapy. The efficacy of this treatment was improved with the development of somatostatin analogues labeled with beta emitting radioisotopes. Further studies have identified DOTA as a superior chelator compared to DTPA, increasing the stability and receptor targeting of somatostatin analogues\\[10\\]. There is now a large clinical experience with Yttrium-90 DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide peptide radioreceptor therapy (PRRT) in Europe, primarily in adults with neuroendocrine tumors\\[11\\]. An international Phase II clinical trial then followed and included several trial sites in the United States, notably the University of Iowa, where we entered 40 subjects\\[12\\]. With its low toxicity profile, the significant improvement in symptoms and quality of life and the lack of effective alternative therapies, PRRT has been suggested as possible first-line therapy in adult patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. Recent data have also demonstrated a significant survival benefit with PRRT compared to historical controls in this population. We have also now conducted a Phase I trial of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide in children and young adults at the University of Iowa, which also shows promise of efficacy of this treatment in pediatric patient population\\[13\\]. We now propose a new imaging agent for use in diagnosis and therapy of Somatostatin receptor positive tumors.\n\nSomatostatin Receptor PET Imaging with Ga-68 DOTA0-Tyr3-octreotide\n\nMore recently, positron emission tomography (PET) radiopharmaceuticals have been developed that can be labeled with Gallium-68 (Ga-68). Gallium-68 is a generator product with a half-life of 68 min (compared to 67 hours for In-111 in OctreoScan). The parent nuclide of Ga-68 is Germanium-68, which has a half-life of 270.8 days. Ga-68 decays by 89% through positron emission and 11% by electron capture. Its parent, A number of Ga-68 DOTA-conjugated peptides have been introduced, including Ga-68 DOTA0-Tyr3\\]octreotide (Ga-68 DOTATOC), Ga-68 DOTA0-1NaI3-octreotide (Ga-68 DOTANOC) and \\[Ga-68 DOTA0-Tyr3\\]octreotate (Ga-68 DOTATOC). All of these radiolabeled peptides bind to sstr2, although DOTANOC also binds to sstr 3 and sstr 5, and DOTATOC to sstr5\\[14\\]. The primary advantage of Ga-68 based somatostatin receptor PET imaging over OctreoScan SPECT is the higher imaging resolution and accurate quantitation of uptake due to robust attenuation correction. The improved resolution and quantitation of uptake obtained with Ga-68 DOTATOC PET should provide a more accurate assessment of somatostatin receptor density, which will lead to a more accurate prediction of treatment response to somatostatin analogues. A recent study from Europe comparing Ga-68 DOTATOC with Octreoscan found Ga-68 DOTATOC to be superior in detection of skeletal and pulmonary involvement of neuroendocrine tumors\\[15\\].\n\nRationale and overall study design\n\nRationale:68Ga-DOTATOC positron emission tomography (PET) scanning and 90Y-DOTATOC peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) are readily available in Europe, but neither radiopharmaceutical is approved for use in the United States. IND #61,907 is currently active under the above named investigators for 90Y-DOTATOC PRRT in somatostatin receptor positive tumors. These investigators have conducted a single institution Phase I trial of 90Y-DOTATOC therapy in children and young adults (Appendix I) and have participated in a Phase II trial of 90Y-DOTATOC PRRT in adults (also in Appendix II).\n\nThe purpose of this amendment to the IND application is to test the efficacy of 68Gallium-DOTATOC in diagnosis, staging, and determination of response to 90Y-DOTATOC PRRT in children and adults with known or suspected somatostatin receptor positive tumors, including, but not limited to neuroendocrine tumors, neuroblastoma, and medulloblastoma. 68Ga-DOTATOC PET would replace 111In-DTPA-Octreotide single photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging. Whereas, Octreoscan uses a 222 MBq imaging dose of Indium (2.8 day half life) resulting in an effective dose equivalent (HE) equal to 2.61 rads, \\[68Ga\\]DOTATOC (68 min half life) uses 185 MBq with an effective dose equivalent of 0.46 rads. In addition, \\[68Ga\\]DOTATOC PET/CT can be completed within 2 hours compared to an Octreoscan which requires 3 visits over 24 hours, making \\[68Ga\\]DOTATOC a much more convenient imaging choice for patients. The data obtained in this Ga-68 DOTATOC PET study will be used to support the use of 68Ga-DOTATOC PET for diagnosis and staging in patients with suspected or proven somatostatin receptor positive tumors.",

All patients will receive a single dose of 50 µg Lymphoseek radiolabeled with 0.5 or 2.0 mCi Tc 99m and vital blue dye.",
      "detailed_description": "In patients with primary melanoma and breast cancer, lymph node status is often a strong predictor of outcome and influences the course of treatment a patient may follow after surgery. In an effort to reduce the morbidity and costs of detection of lymph node metastases, surgical oncologists have developed a method by which the sentinel lymph node (SLN; the first node in a draining basin) is identified intraoperatively and removed. This technique, called sentinel node biopsy, has extremely high negative predictive values for melanoma metastases and breast cancer metastases. The two largest trials for melanoma, Morton, et al (2005) and Rossi, et al (2006), reported false negative rates of 6.3% and 14.7%, respectively. Morton, et al (2006), in perhaps the most mature trial reported to date, showed a false negative rate of 3.4%. There is growing evidence that sentinel node biopsy will have a significant impact on the management of melanoma. Sentinel node biopsy also has extremely high negative predictive values for breast cancer metastases; the false-negative rates range from 0% to 9%. There is growing evidence that sentinel node biopsy will have a significant impact on the management of breast cancer. Although the survival and local recurrence studies have yet to be completed, the technique has emerged into common practice.\n\nIntraoperative lymphatic mapping (ILM) with a radiopharmaceutical is a nuclear medicine examination which identifies for the surgeon the first lymph node to receive lymphatic flow from the primary tumor site. This node is removed and analyzed for the presence of malignant cells. By locating the lymph node prior to surgery, a small incision can be used to remove the node and a smaller dissection can be employed. The high negative predictive value of the technique seems to provide an accurate staging procedure and may spare patients who are lymph node negative the morbidity of a complete lymph node dissection. Consequently, staging of melanoma by lymph node mapping and biopsy may be equivalent to regional node dissection without the attendant post surgical morbidity.\n\nAn ideal lymph node imaging agent would exhibit rapid clearance from the injection site, rapid uptake and high retention within the first draining lymph node, and low uptake by the remaining lymph nodes. The ideal agent would also have low radiation absorption; high biological safety; convenient, rapid, and stable technetium-99m labeling; and biochemical purity.\n\nLymphoseek (Technetium Tc 99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid mannosyl dextran, \\[Tc 99m\\] DTPA Mannosyl Dextran) is a radiotracer that accumulates in lymphatic tissue by binding to a mannose binding protein that resides on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages. Lymphoseek is a macromolecule consisting of multiple units of DTPA and mannose, each synthetically attached to a 10 kilodalton dextran backbone. The mannose acts as a substrate for the receptor, and the DTPA serves as a chelating agent for labeling with Tc 99m.\n\nLymphoseek has a diameter of about 5 nm, which is substantially smaller than current agents used for targeting lymphoid tissue. Lymphoseek's small diameter permits enhanced diffusion into lymph nodes and blood capillaries, resulting in a rapid injection site clearance. Upon entry into the blood, the agent binds to receptors in the liver or is filtered by the kidney and accumulates in the urinary bladder.",

      "brief_summary": "Cancers develop in two different ways. First, cancer cells can become invisible to the immune system by stop having proteins on their surface that are required for the immune system to recognize them. In this scenario, tumors do not attract any immune cells (e.g. white blood cells) whatsoever or they do not attract specialized white blood cells against cancer cells, called lymphocytes. White blood cells are the type of immune cells that attack foreign cells, such as cancer cells or normal cells infected with viruses or bacteria. Second, cancer cells can still grow side-to-side with white blood cells but are able to hide from them. As a result, the white blood cells cannot find and attack the cancer cells. Different types of cancers have different chance of having immune cells in the tumor. For example, the possibility that immune cells are within skin melanomas is almost 50% whereas the possibility in melanoma of the eye is only 10%.\n\nAs a result, the first goal of this study is to understand whether entinostat can make a melanoma tumor more visible to the immune system. To see whether entinostat makes tumor more visible to the immune system, participants will have a mandatory tumor biopsy 3 weeks after starting entinostat therapy. Tumor tissue collected before and after participating in this study will be compared to see if there are more immune cells in the tumor after receive entinostat. The second goal of the study is to see if giving a combination of entinostat and pembrolizumab can shrink melanoma tumors of patients who did not have immune cells in tumors prior to treatment. The study will determine how many subjects cancer has become better or not changed 6 months after subjects have started treatment on the study. We will also determine what type of side effects occur in subjects receiving entinostat and pembrolizumab to look at the safety of this combination.\n\nThe investigators will also look at any changes in the DNA of melanoma before the study begins. As a result of these changes in DNA, there are often see differences in the proteins that work to create other proteins. In addition, the study will look into how entinostat may make melanoma cells more visible to the immune system by comparing proteins in tumors before and after treatment. Finally, the study will see if this treatment changes the numbers and types of immune cells that are found in the blood by comparing blood at different time points while patients are on the study.",
      "detailed_description": "This is an exploratory (n=10-12 evaluable patients), open-label, single-arm, phase II study in patients with 'non-inflamed' unresectable regional or distant metastatic melanomas irrespective of prior treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors. The primary endpoint is to assess the incidence of histopathologic conversion of non-inflamed melanomas from patients with metastatic melanoma to 'inflamed' melanoma following single-agent entinostat \"priming\" (entinostat monotherapy). More specifically, patients with metastatic melanomas that have no evidence of tumor-infiltrating or tumor-associated lymphocytes (TIL/TAL), based on standard hematoxylin and eosin (H\\&E) staining of representative tumor sections (non-inflamed melanomas) will receive weekly entinostat for 3 weeks in cycle 1 (entinostat monotherapy; 5mg PO, qwk on D1, D8, D15 of cycle 1; cycle length = 21 days). Mandatory tumor tissue biopsies will be performed in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 21±2 days), immediately before treatment with concurrent entinostat (once weekly × 3) and pembrolizumab (200 mg q3wks) in cycles 2-9 (see section 5.2.1 drug dosing schema). Correlative studies will be performed at baseline and in the end of cycle 1, beginning of cycle 2 (day 21±2 days) to assess whether: (a) 3 weeks of entinostat monotherapy converts TIL/TAL-absent melanomas to TIL/TAL-present by histopathologic (H\\&E stain) analysis, (b) 3 weeks of single-agent entinostat induces changes in gene expression profiling by assessing distinct signatures as defined by RNA-sequencing signatures (RNA-seq; 'immune-high', innate anti-PD-1 resistance, and epigenetic 1-3), (c) 3 weeks of single-agent entinostat induces changes in histone-accessible DNA by performing formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE)4, (d) conversion of non-inflamed to inflamed melanomas by single-agent entinostat and/or antitumor response to the entinostat-pembrolizumab combination is associated with a baseline signature that consists of distinct somatic mutation gene profile, global histone modification profile in melanoma tissue or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and/or abundance of entinostat targets in melanoma cells (HDAC 1, 2, 3, and 11). Up to 12 evaluable patients will be treated with entinostat plus pembrolizumab for up to 27 weeks (approximately 6 months) based on clinical benefit. Patients who continue to have clinical benefit at 27 weeks may continue therapy with pembrolizumab or any other PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor, as per standard of care.Secondary exploratory endpoints involve: (a) assessment of antitumor response of entinostat administered concurrently with pembrolizumab at week 10 (or earlier if patient progresses), based on response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). (b) assessment of the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 27 weeks (approximately 6 months) of the entinostat-pembrolizumab combination.

Each new group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of LL37 is found.\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nOne (1) time a week for 8 weeks, LL37 will be injected into 2-4 tumors. The injections will be done in the clinic.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nWithin 1 week before your first study drug injection:\n\n* You will have a physical exam.\n* You will have a punch biopsy of a tumor. To collect a punch biopsy, the area of skin is numbed with anesthetic and a small cut is made to remove all or part of the affected tissue.\n* Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* The tumors will be measured and photographed.

Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temsirolimus together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.",

      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n* Most therapeutic therapies for metastatic melanoma have focused on the ability of T-cell lymphocytes to kill cells of tumors.\n* An adaptive cell transfer therapy has been pioneered, in which cells are grown for a short time in the laboratory. The way they are grown may have a better effect in a patient's body than do other cells that are cultured for a longer time.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To determine whether tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) can be put in cells removed from patients' tumors or blood and then reinfused, with the purpose of shrinking tumors.\n* To evaluate safety and effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic cancer melanoma (cancer that has spread beyond the original site).\n* Patient's leukocyte antigen type is human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A) 0201.\n\nDesign:\n\n-Patients undergo the following procedures:\n\n* Leukapheresis (on two occasions). This is a method of collecting large numbers of white blood cells. The cells obtained in the first leukapheresis procedure are grown in the laboratory, and the TIL cells (called young TIL cells) are inserted into the cells using an inactivated (harmless) virus in a process called retroviral transduction. Cells collected in the second leukapheresis procedure are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the study treatment.\n* Chemotherapy. Patients are given chemotherapy through a vein (intravenously, IV) over 1 hour for 2 days to suppress the immune system so that the patient's immune cells do not interfere with the treatment.\n* Treatment with young TIL cells. Patients receive an IV infusion of the treated cells, followed by infusions the drug aldesleukin-2 (IL-2), which helps boost the effectiveness of the treated white cells.\n* Patients are given support medications to prevent complications such as infections.\n* Patients may undergo a tumor biopsy (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue).\n* Patients are evaluated with laboratory tests and imaging tests, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, 4 to 6 weeks after treatment and then once a month for 3 to 4 months to determine the response to treatment.\n* Patients have blood tests at 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually for 5 years.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) can mediate the regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered to an autologous patient with high dose (HD) IL-2 following a non-myeloablative (NMA) but lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen.\n* Clinical investigations and preclinical animal models have demonstrated that less time in culture, longer telomeres, and a less differentiated lymphocyte phenotype are associated with TIL that are capable of mediating objective clinical responses and persisting long term in the host.\n* Previous methods for generating TIL require screening for anti-tumor specificity using gamma-interferon (IFN) production by the TIL. However, in vitro screening depends on autologous tumor reagents that are often unavailable; and gamma-IFN release in vitro may not be the best correlate to in vivo efficacy. Additionally, this method necessitates long in vitro culture times (44 days), and therefore reduces the clonal heterogeneity of TIL cultures, and results in TIL cultures with shorter telomere lengths and phenotypes that are skewed toward a more differentiated phenotype.\n* In Surgery Branch pre-clinical experiments, we evaluated a method for rapidly generating young TIL from melanoma tumors with optimal phenotypic characteristics.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* In cohort 1, to determine the ability of autologous TIL cells infused after minimal in vitro culture in conjunction with high dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen to mediate tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n* In cohort 2, to determine the ability of autologous cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) cell depleted TIL cells infused after minimal in vitro culture in conjunction with high dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen to mediate tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n* In cohort 3, to determine the ability of autologous CD4+ cell depleted TIL cells infused after minimal in vitro culture in conjunction with high dose aldesleukin following chemoradiation lymphoid depleting regimen to mediate complete tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n* In a prospective randomized fashion, to compare the ability of autologous TIL cells (cohort 4) and autologous CD4plus cell depleted TIL cells (cohort regimen, to mediate tumor regression, progression free survival, and overall survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n* Evaluate the toxicity of these treatment regimens.\n* Determine the rate of repopulation of the young TIL cells in treated patients and establish in vitro correlates of TIL cultures that mediate objective response and in vivo persistence.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients who 18 years of age or older must have:\n\n* Metastatic melanoma;\n* Normal values for basic laboratory values.\n\nPatients may not have:\n\n* Received prior cell transfer therapy that included non-myeloablative or ablative chemotherapy;\n* Concurrent major medical illnesses;\n* Any form of immunodeficiency;\n* Severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study;\n* Contraindications for high dose IL-2 administration.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients will undergo resection to obtain tumor for generation of autologous TIL cultures.\n* Cohort 1:\n\n  * All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day IV) on days -7 and -6 and fludarabine (25 mg/m\\^2/day IV) on days -5 through -1.\n  * On day 0 patients will receive the infusion of autologous TIL and then begin high-dose aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses).\n  * Clinical and Immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after TIL infusion.\n  * Using a small optimal two-stage Phase II design, initially 21 patients will be enrolled, and if two or more of the first 21 patients has a clinical response (partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)), accrual will continue to 41 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response. Cohort 1 will be closed with amendment D.\n* Cohort 2 will be initiated with amendment D whereby CD4+ cells will be eliminated from the cultures, using the Miltenyi Clinimacs apparatus, prior to performing the rapid expansion of the young TIL cells. Patients in cohort 2 will receive CD4+ cell depleted young unselected TIL. Patients will also receive high dose IL-2 after non-myeloablative but lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen as described above for cohort 1. Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after TIL infusion. Using a small optimal two-stage Phase II design, initially 18 patients will be enrolled, and if three or more of the first 18 patients have a clinical response (PR or CR), accrual will continue to 35 patients, targeting a 30% goal for objective response. With the initiation of Cohort 3 with amendment H, patients will only be accrued to Cohort 2 if they are not eligible to receive 600 cGy due to prior radiation, or to inability to mobilize cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34+) cells. Also at this time, accrual will be expanded to a total of 50 patients in cohort 2. Cohort 2 will be closed with amendment K.\n* Cohort 3 will be initiated with amendment H, whereby patients will receive a chemoradiation lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, and 600 cGy total body irradiation followed by intravenous infusion of autologous CD4+ cell depleted young TIL plus IV high dose IL-2. Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after TIL infusion. Using a small optimal two-stage Phase II design, initially 26 patients will be enrolled, and if one or more of the first 26 patients have a complete response (CR), accrual will continue to 51 patients, targeting a 10% goal for complete response.

      "brief_summary": "The incidence of new diagnosed patients with NET of the digestive tract including carcinoid and pancreatic islet cells tumors ranges from 2 to 10 per 100,000 in the western Countries (Kulke M, Mayer R. N Engl J Med 340:858-868, 1999). Despite of the low incidence, the prevalence of these tumors is high because of their relatively long survival estimated in 35% at 5 years for those patients with well or moderate differentiated tumors (Yao JC, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2008;26:3063-3072). In fact, digestive NETs are the second most prevalent tumors derived from the digestive tract after colorectal carcinoma.\n\nNETs are characterized by abundant vasculature, moreover VEGFR and VEGFR are overexpressed in 60-84% of the carcinoids and pancreatic islet cells NETs (Zhang et al. Cancer 2007;109:1478-1486). Other pro-angiogenic factors like the platelet derived growth factor (PDGFR) have been also involved in NET progression and development (Chaudhry A, et al.Cancer Res 1992;52:1006-12).\n\nPazopanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the VEGFR, PDGFR and KIT with a dual activity both as an antiangiogenic and also and anti-tumoral agent (Kumar et al. Mol Cancer Ther2007;6:2012-2021, Hurwitz et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:4220-4227). Pazopanib seems to have a better toxicity profile versus the other antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors and has already shown activity in several tumor types like renal cell carcinoma (Sternberg et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 5021), soft tissue sarcomas (Sleijfer et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:3126-32), hepatocellular carcinoma (Yau et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3561), colorectal cancer (Brady et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst.4133), and thyroid cancers (Bible et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3521).\n\nThe Spanish Group for Research in Neuroendocrine Tumors (GETNE) group is an active Member inside of the GENET group and has a large tradition in clinical trials in NETs. The investigators hypothesize that pazopanib may have at least as good activity and better safety profile than other VEGFR inhibitors in progressive advanced or metastatic NET tumors derived from the digestive tract.",

Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving carboplatin and paclitaxel together with sorafenib tosylate is more effective than carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating melanoma.",

To compare the overall survival of patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel and placebo versus carboplatin, paclitaxel and sorafenib (sorafenib tosylate).\n\nII. To compare progression-free survival, response rate, and safety of patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma treated with carboplatin, paclitaxel and placebo versus carboplatin, paclitaxel and sorafenib.\n\nIII. To analyze the pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic properties of sorafenib including angiogenesis, monooxygenases polymorphisms and multidrug resistance (MDR).\n\nIV. To assess the association of expression markers in the patient tumor with clinical outcome.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nArm I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Patients also receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) (approximately every 12 hours) on days 2-19.\n\nArm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in Arm I. Patients also receive placebo PO BID (approximately every 12 hours) on days 2-19.\n\nIn both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or who achieve a partial response or complete response may continue to receive sorafenib tosylate or placebo alone BID (approximately every 12 hours) on days 1-21. Courses with sorafenib tosylate or placebo repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.",

      "detailed_description": "In patients with primary melanoma and breast cancer, lymph node status is often a strong predictor of outcome and influences the course of treatment a patient may follow after surgery. In an effort to reduce the morbidity and costs of detection of lymph node metastases, surgical oncologists have developed a method by which the sentinel lymph node (the first node in a draining basin) is identified intraoperatively and removed. This technique, called sentinel node biopsy, has extremely high negative predictive values for melanoma metastases and breast cancer metastases. The two largest trials for melanoma, Morton, et al (2005) and Rossi, et al (2006), reported false negative rates of 6.3% and 14.7%, respectively. Morton, et al (2006), in perhaps the most mature trial reported to date, showed a false negative rate of 3.4% . There is growing evidence that sentinel node biopsy will have a significant impact on the management of melanoma. Sentinel node biopsy also has extremely high negative predictive values for breast cancer metastases; the false-negative rates range from 0% to 9%. There is growing evidence that sentinel node biopsy will have a significant impact on the management of breast cancer. Although the survival and local recurrence studies have yet to be completed, the technique has emerged into common practice.\n\nLymphatic mapping with a radiopharmaceutical is a nuclear medicine examination which identifies for the surgeon the first lymph node to receive lymphatic flow from the primary tumor site. This node is removed and analyzed for the presence of malignant cells. By locating the lymph node prior to surgery, a small incision can be used to remove the node and a smaller dissection can be employed. The high negative predictive value of the technique seems to provide an accurate staging procedure and may spare patients who are lymph node negative the morbidity of a complete lymph node dissection. Consequently, staging of melanoma by lymph node mapping and biopsy may be equivalent to regional node dissection without the attendant post surgical morbidity.\n\nAn ideal lymph node imaging agent would exhibit rapid clearance from the injection site, rapid uptake and high retention within the first draining lymph node, and low uptake by the remaining lymph nodes. The ideal agent would also have low radiation absorption; high biological safety; convenient, rapid, and stable technetium-99m labeling; and biochemical purity.\n\nLymphoseek (technetium-99m-labeled diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-mannosyl-dextran, \\[Tc-99m\\]DTPA-mannosyl-dextran) is a radiotracer that accumulates in lymphatic tissue by binding to a mannose-binding protein that resides on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages.

Autologous CD8+ antigen-specific T cells are white blood cells that are designed in the laboratory to find melanoma cells and may kill them. Biological therapies, such as aldesleukin, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

There are two phases, Prime Phase and a Boost Phase. If they participate they will receive nivolumab in combination with CMP-001 for a total of 7 weeks (Prime Phase) prior to surgery. Surgery will be performed approximately 2-4 weeks after completion of the Prime Phase. After recovery from surgery patients will receive additional nivolumab in combination with CMP-001 for approximately 46 additional weeks (Boost Phase).\n\nThe main goal of this research study to determine if the combination of nivolumab and CMP-001 improves the likelihood of eradicating (destroying) disease in the lymph node (pathologic response rate). Pathologic responses are associated with improved relapse-free and overall survival in melanoma.\n\nPrior to surgery (Prime Phase) Nivolumab 240mg, will be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on an outpatient basis. During the Prime Phase, 3 cycles of Nivolumab will be administered every 2 weeks over a 6 week period starting with cycle 2, cycle 4 and then cycle 6.\n\nPrior to surgery (Prime Phase) CMP-001 will be given as an injection from a syringe weekly for a total of 7 weeks. The first injection (week 1), 5mg, will be applied directly into the skin and the remaining injections, 10mg will be administered, will be given intra-tumorally for weeks 2-7.\n\nSurgery will be performed to the cancerous lymph node 2-4 weeks after the Prime Phase is completed.\n\nAfter recovery from surgery (Boost Phase) Nivolumab will be administered at 240mg every 2 weeks or 480 mg every 4 weeks depending on the physician's preference. CMP-001, 5mg, will be administered by injections intra-tumorally every 4 weeks for up to 54 weeks.\n\nPatients will be followed to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first.

      "detailed_description": "The Study Drugs:\n\nAvastin is designed to prevent the formation of new blood vessels that help cancer cells to grow. RAD001 is designed to block a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells.\n\nStudy Groups:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two treatment groups. During Cycle 1, one group will receive Avastin and the other group will receive RAD001. Each study cycle is 3 weeks long. In Cycle 2 and every cycle after that, participants in both groups will receive both study drugs. There is an equal chance of being assigned to either group.\n\nRAD001 Administration:\n\nRAD001 tablets are taken once a day by mouth, followed by a large glass of water. The tablets are in a blister-pack under aluminum foil. The blisters should only be opened at the time you take the study drug.\n\nYou may either take RAD001 on an empty stomach or after a low-fat meal. Some examples of low-fat meals include: cereal with fat-free milk, muffin or bagel with fat-free spread, or fruit salad. You should avoid taking RAD001 after large fatty meals because this will lower the amount of RAD001 your body absorbs. Your dietary habits around the time you take RAD001 should be as consistent as possible throughout the study.\n\nYou should take RAD001 at about the same time each day. The study staff will give you a medication diary that you should bring to every study visit. You will be asked to use the diary by writing down the date and time you take RAD001, how many tablets you take, and any side effects you may experience.\n\nAvastin Administration:\n\nAvastin is given through a needle in a vein in the arm. The first dose will be given over about 90 minutes. If no intolerable side effects occur, the second dose will be given over about 60 minutes, and if again no intolerable side effects occur, each dose after that will be given over about 30 minutes.\n\nOther Medications:\n\nIf you experience side effects from an Avastin infusion (such as fever/chills), you may receive additional medicine(s) at that time and before each later Avastin dose, in order to decrease the risk of side effects.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nOn Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive your assigned study drug.\n\nAt the beginning of Cycle 2 and every cycle after that, you will be asked about any side effects you are experiencing. You will have a complete physical exam performed, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will also be collected for routine tests.\n\nOn Day 8 of Cycles 1 and 2 only, about 2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn for routine tests. These blood draws may be done at a local lab closer to your home.\n\nEvery 9 weeks, to check the status of the disease, you will have either CT scans or MRI scans of the tumor(s). The scans will be the same type that you had performed during screening. You will also have additional blood drawn (about 1-2 tablespoons each time) to check any tumor markers that were found to be increased in your blood during the screening tests.\n\nIn order to learn about the flow of blood to the tumor, non-routine functional CT scans will be performed at the end of Cycles 1 and 3. When possible, these scans will be performed at the same times as the routine CT scans.\n\nLength of Study Treatment:\n\nYou may receive up to 12 cycles of study treatment, as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.\n\nThis is an investigational study. RAD001 is not commercially available or FDA approved for this type of cancer. Avastin is commercially available and FDA approved for the treatment of advanced cancer of the colon and rectum. At this time, this drug combination is being used for research only.\n\nUp to 36 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at The University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center.",

      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n* The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy that involves taking white blood cells from patients' tumors, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, and then giving the cells back to the patient. These cells are called Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes, or TIL and we have given this type of treatment to over 400 patients with melanoma.\n* In this trial, we are determining if there is a difference in the response between patients who have received prior anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) treatment to those who have not received this prior ant-PD1 treatment.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To determine if there is a difference in the rate of response between patients who have received prior anti-PD1 and those who have not.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Individuals at least 18 years and less than or equal to 70 years of age who have metastatic melanoma.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Work up stage: Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.\n* Surgery: Surgery or biopsy will be performed to obtain tumor from which to grow white blood cells. White blood cells will be grown from the tumor in the laboratory.\n* Leukapheresis: Participants will have leukapheresis to collect additional white blood cells. (Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.)\n* Treatment: Participants will receive standard dose chemotherapy to prepare their immune system to accept the white blood cells. Participants will receive an infusion of their own white blood cells grown from tumor. They will also receive aldesleukin for up to five days to boost the immune system s response to the white blood cells. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n* Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.",

Each group has 2 \"stages.\"\n\nGroup A:\n\nA total of 27 patients will be enrolled in Group A and will receive a 40mg dose of tesetaxel, adjusted for individual body weight. For Group A, 13 patients will be enrolled in Stage 1. If at least 1 patient has a response to the 40 mg dose of tesetaxel, 14 additional patients will be enrolled in Stage 2 at the same dose level.\n\nGroup B:\n\nA total of 27 patients will be enrolled in Group B and will receive a 50mg dose of tesetaxel, adjusted for individual body weight. For Group B, 13 patients will be enrolled in Stage 1 while researchers are waiting to see if patients in Group A respond to the study drug. If at least 1 patient has a response to the 50 mg dose of tesetaxel, 14 additional patients will be enrolled in Stage 2 at the same dose level.\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nNo matter which Group you are assigned to, you will take tesetaxel capsules by mouth in the morning with water (6 ounces) on Day 1 of each 21-day study cycle. You must not eat or drink anything except water (fast) for at least 4 hours before taking tesetaxel. After fasting for 4 hours and taking tesetaxel, you may eat an average sized meal.\n\nBefore you take tesetaxel, you will receive drugs to prevent nausea and vomiting. The study doctor will discuss this with you. If you have a rash or allergic reaction, you may be receive an antihistamine and/or corticosteroid. If you develop a low number of white blood cells or red blood cells, you may be given growth factor drugs or receive transfusions. These drugs may be given by mouth or vein.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nOn Day 1 of all Cycles:\n\n-Your medical history, including any side effects you may have had and any drugs you may be taking, will be recorded.\n\nOn Day 9 (+/- 1 day) and again on Day 20 (+/- 2 days) of all Cycles:\n\n* Any side effects you may have had and any drugs you may be taking will be recorded.\n* Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\nWithin 5 days before the start of cycles 3, 5, 7 and every other cycle thereafter:\n\n* You will have a CT scan of the chest, stomach, and hip areas.\n* Photographs of any melanoma on your skin will be taken.\n* Any side effects you may have had and any drugs you may be taking will be recorded.\n\nAfter the last dose of tesetaxel, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\nWithin 3 weeks after the last dose of tesetaxel:\n\n* You will have a CT scan of the chest, stomach, and hip areas.\n* Photographs of any melanoma on your skin will be taken.\n* Any side effects you may have had and any drugs you may be taking, will be recorded.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYou may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.\n\nFollow-Up Visits:\n\nIf the melanoma does not get worse while you are on study, you will have visits every 2 months for up to 12 months after your first dose of study drug. At these visits:\n\n* You will have a CT scan of the chest, stomach, and hip areas.\n* Photographs of any melanoma on your skin will be taken.\n* Any side effects you may have had and any drugs you may be taking, will be recorded.\n* You will be asked about any treatment you may be receiving.\n\nIf the disease gets worse while you are on study, you will have follow up phone calls every 2 months for up to 12 months after your first dose of study drug. During these calls, you will be asked how you are feeling and about any therapy you are receiving. These calls should take about 5 minutes.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Tesetaxel is not FDA approved or commercially available. It is currently being used for research purposes only.\n\nUp to 54 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D.

      "detailed_description": "In Cohort 1, 6 subjects were initially vaccinated with the NY-ESO-1 ISCOM vaccine at a dose of 100 µg of the NY-ESO-1 protein + 120 µg of the ISCOM adjuvant. These 6 subjects were monitored for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for 7 days after the first vaccination. Upon observation of tolerability (ie, \\< 2/6 subjects with DLT), enrollment proceeded to a total accrual of approximately 25 subjects. Subjects received 3 vaccinations administered every 4 weeks (ie, weeks 1, 5, and 9) followed by immunological and clinical response evaluations, with clinical responses categorized according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). In the absence of disease progression, subjects may have received 3 additional vaccinations administered every 4 weeks, followed by additional vaccinations administered every 12 weeks thereafter until development of disease progression or other criteria for discontinuation.\n\nIn Cohort 2, subjects received the NY-ESO-1 ISCOM vaccine on the same schedule as described for Cohort 1, but Cohort 2 subjects also received a single intravenous infusion of low-dose cyclophosphamide 1 day prior to each NY-ESO-1 ISCOM vaccination. If responses were observed in 2 of 16 subjects initially treated in Cohort 2, then 9 additional subjects were to be accrued to Cohort 2, for a total potential accrual of 25 subjects.",

Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to study treatment. Note: Females are considered of childbearing potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.\n11. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use an adequate methods of contraception, as outlined in the protocol. Oral contraception is required 14 days prior to initiation of study medications until 120 days after treatment discontinuation. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\n12. Male patients with female partners must have had a prior vasectomy or agree to use an adequate method of contraception as outlined in the protocol- Contraception, starting with the first dose of study therapy through 150 days after the last dose of study therapy. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\n13. As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, willingness and ability of the subject to understand and comply with study procedures.\n14.

If patient has received adjuvant treatments, in particular ipilimumab and high dose interferon, any toxicities must have resolved to grade 1 or less. Grade 2 toxicities attributed to ipilimumab from autoimmune endocrinopathies that require permanent hormone replacement therapy are allowed as long as they are adequately treated. This implies that patients should be off systemic steroids for treatment of any of these or other autoimmune toxicities (e.g. colitis, rash).\n\nSubjects who have previously received PD-1 inhibitors in stage III (adjuvant) or stage IV are allowed as long as:\n\n1. the interval between the last dose of the adjuvant PD-1 inhibitor and the date of relapse (clinical or radiographic) is at least 1 year,\n2. if subjects who received treatment for stage IV had antitumor response (partial response or complete response) by RECIST criteria version 1.1 but they stopped due to subject/investigator preference for at least a year between the last dose of the PD-1 inhibitor and the date of relapse (clinical or radiographic). Allowing for these subjects who have previously received PD-1 inhibitors in the adjuvant setting (i.e. no knowledge about clinical benefit) or following definite antitumor response in the metastatic setting is based on a recent case series of subjects who responded to PD-1 inhibitor rechallenge, if they had previously responded to PD-1 inhibitors. This implies that waning antitumor immunity in the absence (i.e. \\>1 year) of costimulation with PD-1 inhibitors may be the reason for cancer recurrence and NOT primary resistance of PD-1 inhibitors.\n3. any side effects that may have occurred during the previous exposure to PD-1 inhibitors are not serious (i.e. grade 1 or 2 by CTCAE version 5.0 criteria).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

If patient has had other malignancy within the last 2 years from which he/she may have been completely cured by surgery alone, or does not require any treatment other than observation at the specialist's discretion, he/she may considered to be enrolled on condition that the risk of development of recurrent or distant metastatic disease based on the American Joint Committee in Cancer (AJCC) staging system is less than 30% in 3 years from the original diagnosis of other malignancy.\n2. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases that are symptomatic and require antiepileptic drugs or corticosteroids (any dose). Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are asymptomatic (i.e., no neurologic symptoms) for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. Patients with previously treated brain metastases should have evidence of stable brain metastases (without evidence of progression by imaging) for at least 2 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment. Patients with previously treated but grown brain metastases (or new brain metastases if there is no prior history of brain metastases) are still allowed in the study as long as the net growth of pre-existing brain lesions (or new brain lesions if there is no prior history of brain metastases) does not exceed 1-cm in largest diameter as measured by brain MRI with IV contrast (for example, a patient with pre-existing brain lesion(s) that has grown by 6-mm in the largest diameter and also has a new lesion that measures 4-mm in largest diameter can still be enrolled in the study; alternatively, a patient that has a new brain lesion that measures 1-cm in the largest diameter and no growth of pre-existing brain lesions can still be enrolled in the study). This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, which is excluded regardless of clinical stability. Subjects with leptomeningeal disease, detected either by brain MRI or by cytology (e.g. lumbar puncture) are also excluded.\n3. Treatment with any investigational drug, immunotherapy or chemotherapy within 28 days prior to study treatment (i.e., initiation of denosumab). Treatment with any targeted therapy (e.g. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) inhibitors) is allowed as long as at least 15 days have elapsed since last dose of drug.\n4. Patients discontinuing prior therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors for melanoma should be off these medications for at least 15 days before starting study treatment.\n5. Prior PD-1/PD-L1 therapies in the adjuvant setting; targeted therapies or prior ipilimumab in the adjuvant setting are allowed.\n6.

This means that it will test a drug - in this case, temozolomide -- that has already been studied and shown to be safe.\n\nSurgery, when possible, is the main treatment for patients with melanoma like yours. In most people, however, melanoma cells have already spread to other places in the body. This means that even with surgery, many people will have the melanoma come back. This is often fatal.\n\nOne goal of this trial is to treat the melanoma cells that might have spread before they have a chance to grow.\n\nAs part of this trial, we also study which genes are turned on and which genes are turned off in your tumor. We will obtain tumor from the biopsy done before you started temozolomide treatment and from the tumor removed during the surgery done after you finish temozolomide treatment. This may help us understand how temozolomide works and how to recognize which tumors will respond.\n\nBefore and during the temozolomide treatment, we will also test a new way of measuring the amount of tumor present. This involves a special way of analyzing the CT scan which you will have anyway. This new technique may allow us to see tumor shrinkage very early in the treatment course.",

This study will help find out if MK-2206 is a helpful drug when taken in patients with neuroendocrine tumor.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Selumetinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether temozolomide is more effective than selumetinib in treating melanoma of the eye.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the progression-free survival (PFS) in three separate patient populations with uveal melanoma: Patients on COHORT 1 (guanine nucleotide binding protein \\[G protein\\], q polypeptide \\[Gnaq\\]/G protein, alpha 11 \\[Gna11\\] mutant uveal melanoma; temozolomide \\[TMZ\\]/dacarbazine \\[DTIC\\] naive) treated with AZD6244 (selumetinib) or TMZ (or DTIC); patients on both COHORT 1 and COHORT 2 (Gnaq/Gna11 mutant and Gnaq/Gna11 wild-type uveal melanoma; TMZ/DTIC naive) treated with AZD6244 or TMZ (or DTIC); and patients on COHORT 3 (Gnaq/Gna11 mutant or wild-type uveal melanoma; previously treated with TMZ/DTIC) treated with AZD6244.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Overall survival (OS). II. Overall response rate (RR). III. To determine the tolerability of AZD6244 in patients with advanced uveal melanoma.\n\nIV. To correlate PFS, OS, and overall RR with Gnaq and Gna11 mutational status.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To correlate clinical outcome with baseline phosphorylated (p)-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), p-v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression by immunohistochemistry.\n\nII. To correlate clinical outcome with changes in p-ERK, p-AKT, and PTEN expression by immunohistochemistry.\n\nIII. To correlate clinical outcome with changes in Ki67 and cleaved caspase 3. IV. To explore the overall quality of life (QoL) of the treatment groups as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Melanoma (FACT-M) questionnaire.\n\nV. To explore the radiographic effects of treatment with AZD6244 as assessed by 18F fluorothymidine (FLT)-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients in groups 1 and 2 are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients in group 3 are assigned to arm II.\n\nARM I: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are unable to be treated with temozolomide may be treated with dacarbazine intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (with approval from the Principal Investigator). Patients who experience disease progression may crossover to arm II.\n\nARM II: Patients receive selumetinib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.

The safety of this drug combination will also be studied. Researchers will also use samples of the original tumor or metastatic tissue (for example, lymph nodes or liver or lung) that are collected during screening to study if response to the study drug is related to the genes in the tissue.",
      "detailed_description": "The Study Drugs:\n\nHDIL-2 is similar to a hormone naturally found in the body that boosts the immune system by helping \"natural killer\" (NK) cells live longer and work better. NK cells are a type of white blood cell that kill other cells, and they may kill cancer cells.\n\nASCI is a immunotherapy designed to teach your immune system to fight cancer in the same way that you are given vaccines to prevent disease by teaching your immune system to fight an infection caused by germs. Because the cancer is made by your own body, the immune system does not recognize the cancer cells as being harmful. Your immune system needs to be \"trained\" to recognize the cancer cells. This is done by injecting a protein (the MAGE-A3 protein) that is found in the tumor and training your body to recognize it and to destroy the cells that have this protein. This may increase the effectiveness of IL-2 by slowing the growth of the cancer cells, which may cause them to die.\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin the study drugs within 14 days of signing the second consent form. To receive the study drugs, you will be admitted to the hospital, either in the intensive care unit (ICU) or a specifically designated nursing unit where study drugs can be administered, on Day 2 of each cycle and may remain in the hospital for up to 7 days each cycle.\n\nYou may receive a total of 24 ASCI doses either in combination with HDIL-2 or alone. You may receive the study drugs in combination for up to 30 weeks. After that, you may receive the ASCI study medication alone for up to 157 more weeks.\n\nCycle 1 is 14 days (Weeks 1 and 2):\n\n* On Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive the ASCI study medication as an injection. Each injection will be given in the muscle of your upper arm or in your thigh. You will be watched in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after each injection.\n* On Day 2 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive HDIL-2 through a catheter (a small plastic tube that is put into your vein under your collar bone or in your arm) over 15 minutes. HDIL-2 treatment will be delayed in cycles 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 until all HDIL-2 related side effects either go away or the study doctor thinks they are under control.\n\nCycle 2 is 42 days (Weeks 3-8):\n\n* On Day 1 of Weeks 3, 5, and 7 (+/- 2 business days) , you will receive the ASCI study medication as an injection.\n* On Day 2 of Week 3 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive HDIL-2 by vein.\n\nCycle 3 is 14 days (Weeks 9 and 10):\n\n* On Day 1 of Week 9 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive the ASCI study medication as an injection.\n* On Day 2 of Week 9 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive HDIL-2 by vein.\n\nCycle 4 is 49 days (Weeks 11-17):\n\n* On Day 1 of Weeks 11 and 15 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive the ASCI study medication as an injection.\n* On Day 2 of Week 11 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive HDIL-2 by vein.\n\nCycle 5 is 21 days (Weeks 18-20):\n\n* On Day 1 of Week 18 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive the ASCI study medication an injection.\n* On Day 2 of Week 18 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive HDIL-2 by vein.\n\nCycle 6 is 42 days (Weeks 21-26):\n\n* On Day 1 of Weeks 18, 21, and 24 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive the ASCI study medication as an injection.\n* On Day 2 of Weeks 18 and 21 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive HDIL-2 by vein.\n\nCycle 7 is 21 days (Weeks 27-29):\n\n* On Day 1 of Week 27 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive the ASCI study medication as an injection.\n* On Day 2 of Week 27(+/- 2 business days), you will receive HDIL-2 by vein.\n\nCycle 8 is 28 days (Weeks 30-33):\n\n* On Day 1 of Week 30 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive the ASCI study medication as an injection.\n* On Day 2 of Week 30 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive HDIL-2 by vein.\n\nOn Day 1 of Weeks 34, 40, 46, 52, 64, 76, 88, and 100 (+/- 2 business days), you will receive the ASCI study medication as an injection.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nOn Day 1 of Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30 (+/- 2 business days):\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs. °Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* You will be asked about any side effects you may be having and drugs you are taking.\n\nOn Day 2 of Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 18, 21, 27, and 30 (+/- 2 business days):\n\n* Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* You will be asked about any side effects you may be having and drugs you are taking.\n\nDuring Weeks 8, 17, 26, 33, 39, 51, 63, 75, 87, 99, 123, 147, 171, and 195 (+/- 1 week):\n\n* You will have and a CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.\n* You will also have an MRI scan or CT scan of the brain to check the status of the disease.\n* You will have photographs of your lesions taken if indicated by your doctor.\n\nOn Day 1 of Weeks 34, 40, 46, 52, 64, 76, 88, 100, 124, 148, 172, and 196 (+/- 2 business days):\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* You will be asked about any side effects you may be having and drugs you are taking.\n\nAdditional Blood Draws:\n\nAdditional blood (about 4 tablespoons each time) will be drawn for laboratory tests to look at how the study drug combination may affect the immune system. These blood draws will be collected on Day 1 of cycle 1 and again during cycle 1 48 hours after the last dose of IL-2. Additional blood draws (about 4 tablespoons each time) will also Part of the blood drawn for these tests will be sent to GSK Biologicals (or a contracted laboratory) for testing.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYou may continue to receive the study drug combination for up to 8 cycles (33 weeks) and ASCI alone for up to 76 more weeks (+/- 2 business days). If you continue beyond completing 8 cycles of HDIL-2, you will receive the ASCI on Day 1 (+/- 2 business days) every 6 weeks for 4 doses (weeks 34, 50, 46, and 52), then on Day 1 (+/- 2 business days) every 12 weeks (weeks 64, 76, 98, and 110) for 4 doses, then on Day 1 (+/- 2 business days) of every 24 weeks (Weeks 134, 158, 182, and 187) for 4 doses.\n\nYou will be taken off the study therapy early if the disease gets worse, you experience intolerable side effects, or the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest. If you are removed from the study because of intolerable side effects, you will be followed weekly by either a phone call or clinic visit until the side effect is tolerable.\n\nEnd-of-Dosing Visit:\n\nAfter receiving the last dose of study drug combination, you will have an end-of-dosing visit:\n\n* Your medical history will be reviewed and you will be asked about any side effects you may be having and drugs you are taking.\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and ANA testing.\n\nFollow-Up Visits:\n\nYou will have follow-up visits after your last dose of study drug, if the disease does not get any worse. Starting after the last dose of study drug, you will have 1 visit every 3 months for the 1st year, every 4 months for the 2nd year, every 6 months for the 3rd and 4th year, then once a year for up to 10 years (+/- 2 business days). At these visits, the following will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n* If the study doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a chest x-ray, CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and/or MRI scan or CT scan of the brain to check the status of the disease.\n\nIf the disease begins to get worse, information about the status of your health will be collected every 2 months. If you are not able to come into the clinic to complete this visit, you will be asked for this information over the phone. The phone call should last about 10-15 minutes each time.\n\nThis is an investigational study. IL-2 is commercially available and FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. HDIL-2 is a higher dose than the standard approved dose of IL-2. The ASCI study medication is not FDA approved or commercially available.

The safety criterion of ≤ 4 (or ≤ 33%) subjects with Grade 3/4 adverse events in Cycle 1 within either tumor type must be met in order to proceed to Stage 2. The starting dose is 4 mg/kg for Imprime PGG. In the event there are a total of \\> 4 (or \\> 33%) of subjects with Grade 3/4 adverse events in Cycle 1, the dose of Imprime PGG will be reduced to 2 mg/kg, and Stage 1 will be repeated at a dose of 2 mg/kg with an additional cohort of n=12 subjects. For the dose that meets the safety criterion in Stage 1, at least 1 response in melanoma subjects and 2 responses in TNBC subjects amongst the 12 subjects within each tumor type must be observed in order to proceed to Stage 2.\n\nStage 2 will enroll an additional 17 subjects with melanoma, and 30 subjects with TNBC. For the dose that meets the Stage 1 safety criterion, success will be declared if at least 4 amongst the total of up to 29 subjects with melanoma, and 13 amongst the total of up to 42 subjects with TNBC achieve an objective response.",

The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety of combining ipilimumab with palliative RT in patients with Stage IV melanoma. Secondary objectives are a) to assess the induction of anti-melanoma immune responses using laboratory correlative studies of T cell responses to melanoma antigens, and b) to compare tumor response rates and duration of response at unirradiated sites with responses in patients with Stage IV disease treated with ipilimumab alone on expanded access study CA184045. In this study, ipilimumab will be administered as recently approved by the FDA (3 mg/kg iv every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments). Palliative RT will start within 2 days of the first ipilimumab dose. Patients will be seen at least every 12 weeks for follow-up following completion of ipilimumab therapy until progression of disease by imaging criteria or increased symptomatology that requires another therapy. A total of 20 patients with previously treated unresectable metastatic melanoma requiring palliative radiation therapy will be treated on this pilot study over approximately 18 months. All subjects who receive study drug will be monitored for safety. Relevant tumor imaging studies will be obtained at baseline, 2-4 weeks following the 4th/last dose of ipilimumab, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression. This study will provide the safety data (and possibly early efficacy signals) needed to proceed with a randomized Phase II study for proof of principle.

      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) are tumours derived from enterochromaffin cells, which are characterised by the expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) on their surface. These tumours release substances into systemic circulation, resulting in episodic flushing, wheezing, diarrhoea, and eventual right-sided valvular heart disease. All of these symptoms negatively impact on patients' quality of life. The management of NET is primarily determined by the stage of disease. For patients with localised or limited disease the primary modality of therapy is surgery. Whilst patients with metastatic disease, undergo systemic therapy with palliative intent. Accurate imaging is therefore central to the management of this disease. Whilst computed tomography (CT) is useful in the localisation of NET, nuclear imaging using tumour-specific radiolabelled receptors are considerably more sensitive and specific methods for detecting NET and their metastases. The most commonly used positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers used for the visualisation of NET are radiolabelled somatostatin analogs (SSAs) labelled with \\[68Ga\\]Ga-DOTA-peptides.

Subjects were stratified by LDH level (\\> the ULN versus =\\< ULN) and BRAF mutation (V600E versus V600K).\n\nStudy treatment: Dabrafenib and trametinib were administered orally at their recommended doses of 150 mg b.i.d. and 2.0 mg once daily, respectively. Subjects randomized in the combination therapy arm received both the agents. Subjects randomized in the vemurafenib arm received vemurafenib at the recommended dose of 960 mg orally b.i.d. Subjects in both the arms continued treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The protocol was amended on 07-Aug-2014 which allowed subjects who were still receiving vemurafenib to cross over to the dabrafenib and trametinib combination arm, including those subjects who were still receiving vemurafenib monotherapy treatment after disease progression. A washout period of a minimum of 7 days was considered prior to initiating dabrafenib in combination with trametinib. Subjects who experienced disease progression on the vemurafenib monotherapy arm, discontinued vemurafenib monotherapy, and subsequently received another anticancer therapy were ineligible for cross over to the dabrafenib and trametinib combination arm.\n\nFollow-up/Study closure: After study treatment discontinuation, subjects were followed for survival and disease progression as applicable.

      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\nThe National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying them, and then giving the cells back to the patient. In a previous study the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type of virus (retrovirus) to make these tumor fighting cells (anti-ESO-1 cells). About half of the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors. In this study, we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells which we hope will be better in making the tumors shrink.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified cells) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause tumors to shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Patients 15 years old and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on their tumors.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical Center and undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests as needed\n* Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells. {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the patient.}\n* Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO-1 cells and aldesleukin. They will stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks for the treatment.\n* Follow up: Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to 1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking. Follow up visits take up to 2 days.",
      "detailed_description": "PRECIS\n\nBackground:\n\n* We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both and \\<= chains of a murine T cell receptor (mTCR) that recognizes the New York Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma-1 (NY-ESO-1) (ESO) tumor antigen, which can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this T-cell receptor (TCR) with high efficiency.\n* In co-cultures with human leukocyte antigen serotype within the HLA-A serotype group (HLA-A2) and ESO double positive tumors, anti-ESO mTCR transduced T cells secreted significant amounts of Interferons (IFN)- \\>= with high specificity.\n\nPrimary objective:\n\n- To determine whether the administration of anti-ESO mTCR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) plus high-dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen may result in objective tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancers including melanoma expressing the ESO antigen.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Age greater than or equal to 15 years and less than or equal to 70 years.

This mTCR targets the exact same epitope as the human T-cell receptor (hTCR).\n* All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.\n* On day 0 patients will receive anti-ESO mTCR gene-transduced PBMC and then begin high dose aldesleukin.\n* A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) following the administration of the cell product.\n* The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design (Simon R, Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1-10, 1989). The objective will be to determine if the combination of high dose aldesleukin, lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-ESO TCR-gene engineered lymphocytes is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% Partial Response (PR) + Complete Response (CR) rate (p1=0.20).\n* A total of up to 43 patients may be enrolled (41, plus allowing for up to 2 non-evaluable patients).",

The safety of this drug combination will be studied. Researchers would also like to study how this therapy affects the levels of certain chemicals in the blood that are related to your immune system.",
      "detailed_description": "The ability to control melanoma depends on how well your immune system recognizes and then attacks cancer cells. Researchers want to use ipilimumab to try to trigger your immune system response, while temozolomide is designed to damage the cancer cells themselves.\n\nStudy Drugs:\n\nIpilimumab is designed to block the activity of cells that lower the immune system's ability to fight cancer. Blocking these cells may help the body's immune system fight the cancer cells better.\n\nTemozolomide is designed to stop cancer cells from making new DNA (the genetic material of cells). If they cannot make DNA, then they cannot divide into new cancer cells.\n\nStudy Drug Administration:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin to receive treatment with ipilimumab plus temozolomide. You will have an intravenous (IV) catheter placed into a large vein for the Ipilimumab.\n\nThere are 2 phases of study drug treatment: Induction and Maintenance.\n\nDuring the Induction Phase, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 of each 3-week Induction \"course.\" You will take temozolomide by mouth in tablet form on Days 1-4 of each course. You will receive up to 4 courses of Induction therapy.\n\nDuring the Maintenance Phase, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes on Day 1 every 12 weeks. You will also take temozolomide by mouth for 5 days in a row, every 4 weeks.\n\nYou may take the Temozolomide dose within 48 hours of receiving the Ipilimumab dose on Day 1 of both the Induction and the Maintenance Phase.\n\nYou will see your doctor before each new course (every 3 weeks) during the Induction Phase, and once every 4 weeks during the Maintenance Phase. All treatments will be given in the outpatient clinic. You will be given anti-nausea medication to decrease the risk of nausea and vomiting, as needed.\n\nStudy Tests:\n\nBefore Each Course:\n\n(Every 3 weeks during Induction, and every 4 weeks during Maintenance)\n\n* Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests and tests of your liver and kidney function.\n* You will be asked about any medication you are taking and any side effects you are experiencing.\n* Women who are able to become pregnant will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy test.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* Your vital signs will be measured on Day 1.\n\nEvery week, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\nAt the end of each course, any tumor that can be felt with the hands will be measured during physical exam to see if it is shrinking.\n\nEvery 2 courses (+/- 7 days), you will have a chest x-ray and CT or MRI scans performed to check the status of the disease.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYou may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.\n\nIf you stop receiving the study drugs for any reason, you will have an End-of-Treatment Visit.\n\nEnd-of-Treatment Visit:\n\nWithin 14 days after you stop study treatment, you will come into the clinic for the End-of-Treatment Visit. At this visit, the following tests will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including a measurement of your vital signs and weight.\n* You will be asked about any other medications you are taking or any side effects you are experiencing.\n* Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* Your may have a CT or MRI scan performed to check for side effects.\n\nEvery 2 months for up to 3 years, you will also be contacted by telephone or during a clinic visit to see how you are doing.\n\nThis is an investigational study. At this time, temozolomide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of primary brain cancer. However, the use of temozolomide in treating metastatic melanoma is considered investigational. At this time, ipilimumab is being used in research only. The use of these drugs together is also considered investigational.\n\nUp to 64 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",

Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external beam radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position the patient and precisely give a either a single large dose of radiation therapy to a tumor or several large doses of radiation therapy to a tumor using precision and accuracy that is guided by onboard daily imaging prior to radiation therapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some monoclonal antibodies find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving stereotactic radiosurgery together with ipilimumab may kill more tumor cells by causing addition melanoma antigens to be presented to the immune system.",

      "detailed_description": "The present phase II study in 20 patients with BRAFV600E mutant, unresectable stage III/IV melanoma is designed to explore the mechanisms by which tumors acquire resistance to the combination of BRAF and MEK inhibition. Overall response rate and duration to this combination will also be assessed.\n\nTissue will be collected at baseline and at progression (clinical or radiological). Patients may remain on treatment after progression (at the discretion of the investigator) as long as they are still experiencing clinical benefit. We anticipate that up to 50% of patients may continue on therapy post-progression for 2-8 weeks.\n\nBRF113220, the phase I/II trial of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib is ongoing in metastatic melanoma to establish the safety of this combination, and to determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) for each agent. Expansion cohorts at the RP2D for these drugs in combination were included in the phase I to characterize the safety in more detail, and to explore the efficacy of this combination. The combination was well tolerated as described in section 1.5, with decreased frequency of rash compared to either agent alone and with just 1 report of cutaneous SCC.\n\nThis proposed study will utilize the RP2D determined in the Phase I/II study: trametinib 2mg QD and dabrafenib 150 mg BID. Despite a very promising overall response rate of 81%, these patients will also likely go on to develop resistance as a result of new resistance mutations, and given the cooperative signaling network of kinases that sense inhibition of key nodal kinases and induce compensatory responses that offset pharmacological intervention. The study objectives are as follows: Objectives Primary Objective To identify kinases that are differentially expressed pre- and post-treatment with BRAF (dabrafenib) and MEK (trametinib) inhibitors, and to determine a kinome signature predictive of resistance to BRAF/MEK inhibition in stage III/IV melanoma Secondary Objectives To explore whether resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition is associated with new functional mutations in the approximately 150 oncogenes / tumor suppressor genes that are assessed in more than 10% of the tumors (using NextGen DNA sequencing technology) in the subset of patients who co-enroll in LCCC1108, with particular focus on one of five established resistance genes (BRAF, NRAS, MEK1, MAP3K8 or COT, and PTEN) To determine the overall response rate (ORR: complete response + partial response) as measured via RECISTv1.1 To estimate the duration of ORR as measured via RECISTv1.1 To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) as defined by RECISTv1.1 To estimate the rate of overall survival (OS) at 1 year from day 1 of treatment\n\nPrimary Endpoint Kinome signature pathway will be based on comparison of kinome expression from pre- and post-treatment biopsies using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) coupled with mass spectrometry.",

      "brief_summary": "For patients who have one or two metastases in the brain, the tumor(s) can often be removed with surgery to relieve symptoms from the tumor(s) and to improve survival. However, about half of all patients who have the tumor(s) removed with surgery will develop regrowth (recurrence) of the tumor. To prevent this regrowth of tumor, some patients receive radiation to the entire brain (whole brain radiation) after surgery. This involves daily treatment for about two to three weeks, and may cause long-term neurological problems, such as memory loss.\n\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is sometimes used instead of surgery to treat brain metastasis. This involves the use of a special head frame and sophisticated computer programs that enable us to deliver a high dose of radiation to a small focused area of the brain in only one treatment.\n\nResearch has shown that the results of treatment with SRS are as good as surgical removal of the tumor. SRS and surgical resection are considered the standard options for the treatment of brain metastases. This Phase II clinical trial is studying the combination of these two techniques. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of SRS following surgical removal of brain metastases. The outcomes we will be looking at are tumor regrowth after treatment and side effects of treatment.",

Following surgical resection, patients would receive a stereotactic radiosurgery boost to the surgical bed, 2-8 weeks after surgery. A dose of 15 to 22 Gy would be delivered in a single fraction. Patient would be subsequently followed clinically and radiologically to watch for local control as well as toxicity. If a recurrence or new metastasis(es) is detected, further treatment may be given, consisting of chemotherapy, surgery, whole brain radiation therapy or stereotactic radiotherapy.",

      "intervention": "Ziv-aflibercept",
      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock.

Additionally, a non-randomized single-arm was added based on interim analysis findings to assess the efficacy and safety of PDR001 in combination with LAG525 in subjects with previously treated unresectable or metastatic LAG-3 positive melanoma.\n\nThe study consisted of two parts: the selection part and the expansion part, which were applicable to both the randomized and non-randomized sections. In the randomized section, participants were randomized to one of four combination arms available for enrollment:\n\n* Arm 1: LAG525 600 mg intravenously (i.v.) every 4 weeks (Q4W) and PDR001 400 mg i.v. Q4W.\n* Arm 2: INC280 400 mg orally (p.o.) twice daily (BID) and PDR001 400 mg i.v. Q4W.\n* Arm 3: ACZ885 300 mg subcutaneously (s.c.) every 4 weeks (Q4W) and PDR001 400 mg i.v. Q4W.\n* Arm 4: LEE011 600 mg p.o. once daily (QD) on Days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle and PDR001 400 mg i.v. Q4W.\n\nAt each interim analysis, the following determinations were made: (1) which arm met the pre-specified efficacy criteria and expanded to the expansion part, (2) which arms continued enrollment in selection part (up to 45 subjects), and (3) which arms were discontinued due to futility, considering efficacy, safety, and biomarker data. The expansion phase included enrollment of subjects only in the combination arms that met the pre-specified criteria in selection part.\n\nIn the non-randomized section, a single combination arm was opened for enrollment in selection part:\n\n• Arm 1A: LAG525 600 mg i.v. Q4W and PDR001 400 mg i.v. Q4W, assessed in a population selected based on the LAG-3 status of their tumor.\n\nArm 1A would be eligible for enrollment in expansion part only if it met the pre-specified criterion for this arm.\n\nParticipants received the study treatment corresponding to their assigned arm on a 28-day cycle basis until disease progression, as determined by local assessment using RECIST v1.1 criteria, or until certain events occurred, such as unacceptable toxicity, initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, investigator's decision, loss to follow-up, death, or termination of the study by the sponsor. Following discontinuation of the study treatment, all subjects were monitored for safety evaluations for up to 150 days after their last dose of the study treatment.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of melanoma and other cancers. It is not yet known whether ipilimumab is more effective than interferon alfa-2b in treating patients with melanoma.",

To evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS) between patients randomized to receive post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab given at either 10 mg/kg (high dose ipilimumab; HIP) or 3 mg/kg (low dose ipilimumab: LIP) versus those randomized to receive high-dose interferon alfa-2b (HDI) utilizing a hierarchical design assessing HIP versus HDI first and LIP versus HDI second (if the first comparison is significant).\n\nII. To evaluate overall survival (OS) between patients randomized to receive post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab given at either 10 mg/kg (HIP) or 3 mg/kg (LIP) versus those randomized to receive HDI utilizing a hierarchical design assessing HIP versus HDI first and LIP versus HDI second (if the first comparison is significant).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate safety and tolerability of post-operative adjuvant ipilimumab therapy given at either 10 mg/kg (HIP) or 3 mg/kg (LIP).\n\nII. Among patients enrolled by Clinical Community Oncology programs (CCOPs), to compare the global quality of life (QOL) between the ipilimumab arms versus HDI using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-General (G) form and to evaluate the effect of treatment-related side effects that may have an impact on the health-related domains of QOL using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-diarrhea (D) and FACT-biological response modifiers (BRM).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients age \\>= 18 are randomized to Arms A, B, or C and patients ages 12-17 are randomized to Arms D, E, or F.\n\nARM A: Patients receive induction high-dose ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1.

Beginning on week 24, patients receive maintenance low-dose ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 90 days for a maximum of 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly for up to 15 years.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* All patients must have disease-free status documented by a complete physical examination and imaging studies within 4 weeks prior to randomization; imaging studies must include a total body positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) scan (with or without brain) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or CT (if MRI is contraindicated); if PET-CT cannot be done, CT of neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be done\n\n  * If for some reason a CT cannot be done, an MRI may be done instead; any other imaging studies if performed (eg, bone scan) must show no evidence of disease\n* Patients must have primary cutaneous melanoma that belong to one of the following American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) stages (2009 AJCC Melanoma Staging System):\n\n  * Stage IIIB\n\n    * T1-4b N1a M0\n    * T1-4b N2a M0\n    * T1-4b N1b M0\n    * T1-4b N2b M0\n    * T1-4b N2c M0\n  * Stage IIIC\n\n    * T1-4b N1b M0\n    * T1-4b N2b M0\n    * T1-4b N2c M0\n    * Any T N3 M0\n  * Stage IV\n\n    * M1a\n    * M1b\n    * NOTE: patients with stage IV melanoma must have normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and either distant skin, subcutaneous, lymph node, or lung metastases, but no other visceral metastases in order to be eligible; for patients with resected stage IV melanoma, LDH within the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) must be documented within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* Patients with disease recurrence after adequate surgical excision of the original primary cutaneous/unknown primary melanoma are allowed even if they don't fit the strict staging criteria, but only as follows:\n\n  * Recurrence in a regional lymph node basin after a prior complete lymph node dissection; relapsed disease must be completely surgically resected with free margins\n  * Recurrence in the form of in-transit or satellite metastases or distant skin/subcutaneous, nodal, or lung metastases that are completely surgically resected with free margins\n  * Recurrence in a regional lymph node basin; relapsed disease must be completely surgically resected with free margins\n* Patients with unknown primary melanoma (Tx) who present with cutaneous, subcutaneous, nodal and/or lung metastases that are completely surgically resected with free margins are allowed; these patients are allowed even if they don't fit the strict staging criteria; for stage IV patients LDH within the institutional ULN must be documented within 4 weeks prior to randomization (M1c is not eligible)\n\n  * NOTE: all subjects should be classified as IIIB, IIIC, M1a or M1b including subjects with disease recurrence after adequate surgical excision of the original primary melanoma; that is the treating team/physician investigator should review an overall TNM status (that includes primary tumor presentation and disease recurrence status) and provide a designation of IIIB, IIIC, M1a or M1b\n* Patients must be randomized within 84 days (12 weeks) of surgical resection; if more than one surgical procedure is required to render the patient disease-free, the patient must be randomized within 12 weeks of the last surgery\n\n  * NOTE: patients with clinically positive lymph nodes for melanoma involvement or those with positive lymph nodes identified through lymphoscintigraphic and/or dye lymphographic techniques in the groin, axilla, or neck should have additional lymphadenectomy in those sites; the complete lymph node dissection procedure would be considered as the last surgery in counting the 84 days unless a subsequent surgical procedure(s) was clinically required to ensure the disease free status\n* Patients must have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1\n* Given that serious adverse events may occur with ipilimumab and IFN-alpha and that these may impact a patient's wellbeing, it is possible that the occurrence of other serious adverse events (SAEs) may seriously impact an underlying state of mental depression and lead to suicidal ideation; therefore, patients should be carefully screened for depression at baseline and if there are indications or a history of depression it is strongly recommended that these patients be closely followed together with behavioral health or psychiatric medical support; patients with an established diagnosis of depression that, in the assessment of the investigator may make the administration of IFN-alpha or ipilimumab hazardous, should not be enrolled on this protocol; the risks and benefits of being treated with standard adjuvant IFN-alpha should be weighed very carefully in consultation with behavioral health or psychiatry\n* Due to the possible effect of treatment with ipilimumab on the immunologic response to infectious disease vaccines, patients must not have had any infectious disease vaccination (e.g., standard influenza, H1N1 influenza, pneumococcal, meningococcal, tetanus toxoid) within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of ipilimumab or HDI, in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized; women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products, skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or where their partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy) should be considered to be of childbearing potential\n\n  * Men of fathering potential and WOCBP must be using an adequate method of contraception to avoid conception/pregnancy throughout the study and for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of ipilimumab or HDI in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized; men or WOCBP who are unwilling or unable to strictly follow this requirement are not eligible\n  * WOCBP are not eligible if they satisfy any of the following:\n\n    * A positive pregnancy test at baseline\n    * Pregnant or breastfeeding\n* White blood cell (WBC) \\>= 3,000/uL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500/uL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Platelets \\>= 100 x 10\\^3/uL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 10 g/dL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Serum creatinine =\\< 1.5 mg/dL (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =\\< 2.5 x ULN (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* Serum bilirubin =\\< 1.5 x ULN, (except patients with Gilbert's syndrome, who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL) (obtained within 4 weeks prior to randomization)\n* No active or chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C due to the unknown effects of ipilimumab; patients must have negative testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) within 4 weeks prior to randomization\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must not have received any adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, biotherapy, or limb perfusion) after the resection(s) that make(s) them eligible for this trial\n\n  * NOTE: previous radiation therapy, including after the surgical resection, is allowed as long as 21 days have elapsed between the radiation and initiation of this adjuvant systemic therapy\n* Prior treatment with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) monoclonal antibodies or prior CTLA-4 inhibitor or agonist or prior clusters of differentiation (CD)137 agonist or prior interferon-alfa is not allowed; other forms of prior treatment for melanoma (e.g., aldesleukin \\[IL-2\\], anti-tumor vaccine, chemotherapy) are allowed if given before the resection(s) that make(s) the patient eligible for this trial, but these must have been completed at least 4 weeks prior to randomization\n* Patients must not have an active infection requiring current treatment with parenteral antibiotics\n* Patients must not have other significant medical, surgical, or psychiatric conditions or require any medication or treatment that in the opinion of the investigator may interfere with compliance, make the administration of ipilimumab or HDI hazardous or obscure the interpretation of adverse events (AEs), such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea; patients with a baseline of frequent diarrhea (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome) are not eligible because of the difficulty in interpreting later expected GI toxicities that may lead to suboptimal management and complications\n* Patients must not have a documented history of inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) or diverticulitis (history of diverticulosis is allowed)\n* Patients must not have autoimmune disorders or conditions of immunosuppression that require current ongoing treatment with systemic corticosteroids (or other systemic immunosuppressants), including oral steroids (i.e., prednisone, dexamethasone) or continuous use of topical steroid creams or ointments or ophthalmologic steroids; a history of occasional (but not continuous) use of steroid inhalers is allowed; replacement doses of steroids for patients with adrenal insufficiency are allowed; patients who discontinue use of these classes of medication for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization are eligible if, in the judgment of the treating physician investigator, the patient is not likely to require resumption of treatment with these classes of drugs during the study\n\n  * Exclusion from this study also includes patients with a history of symptomatic autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis \\[scleroderma\\], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, autoimmune vasculitis \\[e.g., Wegener's granulomatosis\\]); motor neuropathy considered of autoimmune origin (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis); other central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease (e.g., poliomyelitis, multiple sclerosis)\n  * Patients with autoimmune hypothyroid disease or type I diabetes on replacement treatment are eligible\n* Patients must not be prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical (e.g., infectious) illness; this is due to concerns about subject safety and compliance with study procedures\n* Patients who have other current malignancies are not eligible; patients with other malignancies are eligible if they have been continuously disease free for \\> 5 years prior to the time of randomization; patients with prior history at any time of any in situ cancer, lobular carcinoma of the breast in situ, cervical cancer in situ, atypical melanocytic hyperplasia or melanoma in situ are eligible; patients with prior history of basal or squamous skin cancer are eligible; patients who have had multiple primary melanomas are eligible\n* Women must not be pregnant or breast-feeding due to the unknown effects of ipilimumab and HDI on conception and the fetus; all females of childbearing potential must have a blood test or urine study during screening to rule out pregnancy\n\n  * NOTE: a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is any woman, regardless of sexual orientation or whether they have undergone tubal ligation, who meets the following criteria: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months); post-menopause is defined as:\n\n    * Amenorrhea \\>= 12 consecutive months without another cause, or\n    * For women with irregular menstrual periods and taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level \\>= 35 mIU/mL",

      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\nChemotherapy damages cancer cell deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) so the cells die, and the tumor shrinks. But it may stop working in some people over time. This is partly due to efficient DNA damage repair mechanisms used by tumor cells. VX-970 (M6620) may stop cancer cells from preventing the repair of DNA damaged by chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to see if using the chemotherapy drug topotecan along with the drug VX-970 (M6620) will improve the response to chemotherapy.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo study the safety and efficacy of VX-970 (M6620) and topotecan in treating small cell lung cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults at least 18 years old with small cell lung cancer.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, blood and heart tests, and scans. Most of these tests are part of their routine care. Most of these tests will be repeated throughout the study.\n\nThe study is set in 21-day cycles. Participants will get topotecan intravenous (IV) on days 1 through 5. They will get VX-970 (M6620) IV on day 5 alone or on day 5 and day 2.\n\nParticipants doctors will monitor them weekly for the first cycle, every 3 weeks after that.\n\nFor Part 1 of this Study the doses of topotecan and VX-970 (M6620) will be increased (according to the Protocol) to determine the maximum safe dose of the combination. The maximum safe dose of the combination is the dose at which no more than 1 in 6 people have an intolerable side effect.\n\nMore participants will join in Phase 2. They will take the drugs at the maximum safe dose, on the same schedule as the drugs were taken in Phase 1.\n\nParticipants will give samples of blood, hair, and tumor tissue (optional) at different times. They will discuss side effects at every visit.\n\nA month after stopping taking the drugs, participants will have a physical exam and blood drawn. They will have follow-up phone calls every 3 months.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis.\n\nAlthough highly responsive to chemotherapy initially, SCLC typically relapses quickly and becomes refractory to treatment within a few months.\n\nThere is only one Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatment for patients with relapsed SCLC after first-line chemotherapy: topotecan, which inhibits religation of topoisomerase I-mediated single-strand deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) breaks leading to lethal double-strand DNA breaks.\n\nThe survival of some SCLC cells despite initial tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy suggests the existence of a highly effective DNA damage response network.\n\nSCLC is characterized by high replication stress (RB transcriptional corepressor 1 (RB1) inactivation, MYC and cyclin E1 (CCNE1) activation) and defective ataxia-telangiectasia mutated tumor protein p53 (ATM-p53) signaling pathway, which cause an excessive reliance on ataxia-telangiectasia rad 3-related (ATR) for survival following DNA damage.\n\nWe hypothesize that a combination of ATR kinase inhibition with DNA damaging agents such as topotecan will provide an attractive synthetically lethal therapeutic option for SCLC.\n\nVX-970 is a potent and selective kinase inhibitor of ATR, and in vitro data support the hypothesis that ATR inhibition can improve SCLC responses to DNA damaging agents.\n\nPrimary objectives:\n\nPhase 1: To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan in combination with VX-970.\n\nPhase 2: To assess the efficacy with respect to clinical response rate of a combination of topotecan and VX-970 in the second-line treatment of patients with SCLC.\n\nEligibility:\n\nBoth Phase 1 and 2: Subjects must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have a performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2. Subjects must not have received chemotherapy or undergone major surgery within 4 weeks and radiotherapy within 24 hours prior to enrollment.\n\nPhase 1: Subjects with histologically confirmed SCLC, non-small cell cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and neuroendocrine cancers, and at least one prior chemotherapy. Patients with other histologies will be allowed if no standard treatment options exist. Patients with evaluable, but not measurable disease will be eligible for Phase I.\n\nPhase 2: Subjects with histological confirmation of SCLC and one prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory disease will be eligible. Patients must have measurable disease to be eligible for Phase II.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will receive topotecan and VX-970 administered every 21 days (1 cycle), until disease progression or development of intolerable side effects.\n\nBlood and hair samples will be collected at multiple time points during cycle 1 (pre-treatment on day 1, post treatment on days 2, and 3) for pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses.\n\nTumor biopsies, which are optional, will be obtained at baseline, during the first treatment cycle (approximately 15 hours after the first dose of VX-970 on day 3) and at disease progression except for subjects at the first dose level.\n\nParticipants at the first dose level will undergo biopsies on day 3 prior to third dose of topotecan.\n\nParticipants will be monitored weekly during the first cycle by clinic visit and basic labs.\n\nToxicity will be graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, and tumor assessments will be made using computed tomography (CT) scans (chest, abdomen and pelvis) at baseline and after every 2 cycles according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1.\n\nFollow-up for survival will be carried out every 3 months.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Both Phase I and Phase II:\n\n  * Male and female subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Because no dosing adverse event data are currently available on the use of topotecan in combination with VX-970 (M6620) in subjects less than 18 years of age, children are excluded from this study, but will be eligible for future pediatrics trials.\n  * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal to 2\n  * Patients must have measurable disease, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Subjects with evaluable, but not measurable disease will be eligible for Phase 1.\n  * Subjects must not have received chemotherapy or undergone major surgery within 4 weeks and radiotherapy within 24 hours prior to enrollment.\n  * Adequate organ functions\n\n    * Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL\n    * Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1.5x10\\^9/L\n    * Platelets greater than or equal to 100x10\\^9/L\n    * Total Bilirubin less than or equal to 2.0 mg/dL\n    * Transaminases less than or equal to 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or if liver metastases were present, less than or equal to 3xULN\n    * Creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance by Cockcroft-Gault formula greater than or equal to 60 mL/min\n  * Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n  * The effects of VX-970 (M6620) on the developing human fetus are unknown For this reason and because topotecan is known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, during study participation and for 6 months after the last dose study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Phase I:\n\n  * Subjects with histologically confirmed small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and neuroendocrine cancers will be eligible. Pathological confirmation of diagnosis will be done at National Cancer Institute (NCI) Laboratory of Pathology. Patients with other histologies will be allowed if no standard treatment options exist.\n  * At least one prior chemotherapy\n  * NSCLC subjects with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations should have previously received appropriate Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies in addition to prior chemotherapy\n* Phase II:\n\n  * Histological confirmation of SCLC, or extrapulmonary small cell cancer. Although NCI confirmation of pathology is not required prior to starting treatment, every effort will be made to obtain outside pathology to be reviewed by an NCI pathologist.\n  * Subjects with both platinum-sensitive and platinum-refractory disease will be eligible\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Subjects with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy.\n* Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to (study agent) or other agents used in study.\n* Subjects with symptomatic brain metastases will be excluded from trial secondary to poor prognosis. However, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and whose brain disease is stable without steroid therapy for 1 week or on physiologic doses of steroids may be enrolled.\n* Subjects requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome p450, family 3, subfamily A (CYP3A) during the course of the study are ineligible. Lists including strong inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome p450 3A4 (CYP3A4) are provided.\n* Subjects with evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease, or any concurrent condition, which could compromise participation in the study, including, but not limited to, active or uncontrolled infection, immune deficiencies, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, stroke/cerebrovascular accident within the past 6 months, or psychiatric illness/social situations which would jeopardize compliance with the protocol.\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with VX-970 (M6620). In addition, these subjects are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because topotecan is a Class D agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects and because the effects of VX-970 (M6620) on the developing human fetus are currently unknown. In addition, because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with topotecan or VX-970 (M6620), breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with these agents.",

      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this phase 2 study is to find the best way to give this new experimental regimen and determine if it can treat metastatic melanoma in humans. In this phase 2 study, the experimental products are given initially to a group of 8 people. If safe and found to have significant anti-tumor activity, it will be given to up to 14 other people, for a total of 22 people in this study. Physicians watch subjects carefully for any harmful side effects. Although the experimental regimen has been well tested in laboratory and animal studies, and a similar regimen has been given to a group of patients at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, MD, the side effects in people cannot be completely known ahead of time. This protocol is offered only to people whose condition cannot be helped by other known treatments.\n\nThe study procedures will start with the collection of white blood cells through apheresis (a procedure in which blood is drawn from a patient and separated into its components, some of which are retained, such as white blood cells, and the remainder returned by transfusion to the patient).\n\nSubjects will be asked to undergo two aphereses, one to make the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs (cytolytic T lymphocyte) and the dendritic cell vaccines, and a second one after the subject receives the gene modified cells to later study them in the blood.\n\nOn the day of the first apheresis, subjects will be admitted to the hospital and will receive chemotherapy over the next five days which decreases the risk of rejection of the transferred cells by the subject's immune system and facilitates their expansion and attack of the melanoma lesions. During this time, the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs and the dendritic cells will be manufactured in the laboratory from the apheresis product and will be extensively tested to assure that they express the appropriate TCR and that they do not contain any contaminating bacteria or virus. Then the gene-modified MART-1 TCR CTLs will be given back to the subject through a vein in the arm. It will be followed by vaccination with the dendritic cells under the skin. During the next fourteen days, subjects will also receive interleukin 2 (IL-2), which is a standard treatment for patients with metastatic melanoma. During the next 2 to 3 weeks, subjects will stay in the hospital until the study investigators determine that the subject has fully recovered from all of the procedures, and it is safe for the subject to go home. Chemotherapy frequently causes a decrease in the platelet or red blood cells, and therefore subjects may require platelet and/or red blood cell transfusions.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a two-stage phase II clinical trial with the combined primary endpoints to determine the safety, feasibility and anti-tumor activity of adoptive transfer of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) genetically engineered to express the alpha and beta chains of a high affinity T cell receptor (TCR) specific for the HLA-A\\*0201-restricted MART-1 melanoma tumor antigen to patients with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. This gene transfer will be facilitated by a retroviral vector pseudotyped with a gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) envelope. The two transgenes are linked by a picornavirus 2A sequence. Their expression is driven by the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR).\n\nPatients with MART-1-positive locally advanced or metastatic melanoma who are HLA-A\\*0201-positive, and HIV, hepatitis B and C seronegative, will receive a non-myeloablative but lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and then receive the adoptive transfer of autologous PBMC transduced with the MSGV1-F5AfT2AB retroviral vector, which expresses a high affinity TCR for the MART-1 melanoma antigen (MART-1 F5 TCR). The cell dose will be up to 10\\^9 autologous PBMC transduced with the MSGV1-F5AfT2AB retroviral vector. The transgenic T cells will be infused fresh on the day of harvest as done in the last three patients within this protocol, prior to which, thawed cryopreserved cells were infused. Following adoptive cell transfer, patients will receive MART-1.26-35 peptide-pulsed dendritic cell (DC) vaccines and low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n\nThe MART-1 F5 TCR was provided by Dr. Stephen A. Rosenberg from the Surgery Branch, National Cancer Institute (NCI). The MART-1 F5 TCR is derived from the DMF5 tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) clone, and was selected from several MART-1-specific TCRs because of its high affinity and biological activity. This TCR delivered by the same retroviral vector is currently in clinical testing at the Surgery Branch/NCI. Both the NCI clinical trial and the trial at University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) are based on the same retrovirus expressing the MART-1 F5 TCR used to transduce whole PBMC and re-infused to patients after a non-myeloablative but lymphodepleting chemotherapy conditioning regimen. Major differences between both clinical trials include the shorter ex vivo expansion of TCR transduced PBMC, the use of MART-126-35 peptide pulsed DC and the use of positron imaging tomography (PET) for non-invasive imaging of adoptively transferred TCR transgenic cells in the UCLA clinical trial.\n\nThe primary endpoints will be safety, feasibility and objective tumor response. The phase II clinical trial design will have two treatment stages following a Simon optimal two-stage clinical phase II clinical trial design 1. The clinical trial will have an initial stage with 8 patients followed by a second stage with up to 22 patients.\n\nSafety will be determined in stage one, and if 3 out of 8 patients have MART-1 F5 TCR-induced dose limiting toxicities (DLT), then further accrual will not be warranted. Feasibility will be also determined in the first stage, and if 3 out of 8 patients cannot receive the intended cellular therapies, or if they result in suboptimal TCR transgenic cell in vivo persistence, further accrual will not be warranted to the protocol as currently designed. Objective tumor responses will be determined by RECIST objective response criteria with a design to rule out a 10% response rate as the null hypothesis, and a 35% response rate as the alternative hypothesis. With this statistical design, if 2 or more of 8 patients in stage one have an objective response, the study will proceed to stage two and accrue a total of 22 patients. If 5 or more patients in the overall study have a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), which combined result in the objective response rate, the study will be declared positive.\n\nSecondary study endpoints are transgenic T cell persistence in humans and their ability to home to MART-1 positive melanoma metastasis. Analysis will be performed by sampling of peripheral blood and tumor deposits for T cell persistence and by non-invasive metabolic imaging using PET scans.",

The cells are created in the laboratory using the patient's own tumor cells or blood cells.\n* The procedure also uses one of two vaccines-the anti-MART-1 peptide or the anti-gp100 peptide-to stimulate cells in the immune system that may increase the effectiveness of the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells. Both vaccines are made from a virus that is modified to carry a copy of the MART-1 gene or gp100 gene.

Most of the treatments for this study will be given on an inpatient basis.\n* Before the treatment begins, participants will undergo leukapheresis (removal of selected blood cells) to obtain cells for preparing the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells, and for later stem cell transplantation.\n* Preinfusion treatment: 5 days of chemotherapy and 2 days of total-body irradiation to prepare the immune system for receiving the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells.\n* Infusion of cells, followed by IL-2 treatment to improve immune response. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion through a vein every 8 hours for a maximum of 15 doses (over 5 days).\n* After the cell infusion, participants will be divided into two groups and will receive either the gp100 peptide or MART-1 vaccine, given once a week for 3 weeks.

      "detailed_description": "This study is being done to see if using the study drug, pembrolizumab, can shrink down melanoma tumors enough so that they will be small enough to cut out, so that there will be no cancer left in the body.\n\nEligible participants include those who have not received any systemic melanoma therapies (i.e. participants do not have to fail ipilimumab or BRAF inhibitor) and those who have failed all available systemic options (if the participant meets other inclusion / exclusion criteria).\n\nFor most melanoma cases, surgery is the recommended treatment. Until recently surgery was not used for patients with advanced melanoma (melanoma that has spread to lymph nodes or melanoma that has spread to other organs like the lung, liver, brain) because it was thought that surgery wouldn't help patients live longer when the melanoma tumors had spread beyond the skin. Recent studies have shown that patients with advanced melanoma who have surgery as one of their treatments may live longer than patients who only have systemic therapy (IV drugs or pills) and do not have surgery at all.\n\nUnfortunately, when patients with advanced melanoma come to the doctor, surgery is not a good choice for most patients because they have 'unresectable' melanoma. 'Unresectable' melanoma means they have melanoma tumors in the body that are too big or too close to important parts in the body (like big blood vessels) to be cut out safely. We are studying if we can use a drug to shrink tumors down to make them small enough to cut out; this is called a \"neoadjuvant\" approach to treating melanoma. By removing all of the cancer from body by using the combination of drug and surgery, we think this could help people live longer.\n\nPembrolizumab is a drug that is given in the veins and can make the immune system stronger so that it can fight cancer cells. Pembrolizumab is in the class of drugs called immunotherapy.\n\nImmunotherapy uses parts of a person's immune system to fight the disease. Pembrolizumab is designed to restore the natural ability of the immune system to recognize and target melanoma cells to be attacked. In addition to possibly shrinking tumors, it may change your immune system so that it can fight melanoma in the future.\n\nWe are also trying to learn more about how pembrolizumab works in the body. In this study, we will look at the skin, blood, and bone marrow to see if we can see any signs to tell doctors whether pembrolizumab is working or tell us which patients it may work on.",

Ipilimumab works by activating the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help the immune system recover from the side effects of treatment. It is not yet known whether giving ipilimumab together with sargramostim is more effective than ipilimumab alone in treating melanoma.",

To evaluate the overall survival for the combination of sargramostim (GM-CSF) plus ipilimumab and ipilimumab alone in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the progression-free survival, response rate, safety and tolerability for the combination of GM-CSF plus ipilimumab and ipilimumab alone in patients with advanced melanoma.\n\nII. To explore the utility of immune related response criteria (irRC) prospectively in patients receiving ipilimumab.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive induction therapy comprising ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 and sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles. After 12 weeks of induction treatment, anti-tumor response is assessed and patients then receive maintenance therapy comprising ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 and sargramostim SC once daily on days 1-14. Treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 12 weeks and treatment with sargramostim repeats every 21 days. After 12 weeks of maintenance therapy, anti-tumor response is reassessed and patients with responsive or stable disease then continue maintenance therapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive induction therapy comprising ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 cycles. After 12 weeks of induction treatment, anti-tumor response is assessed and patients then receive maintenance therapy of ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of maintenance therapy, anti-tumor response is reassessed and cycles repeat every 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.",

      "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving everolimus together with temozolomide may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving everolimus together with temozolomide works in treating patients with stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery",

For course 2 and all subsequent courses, patients receive oral everolimus once a day on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26 and oral temozolomide once a day on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAll patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative studies. Samples are analyzed for relative numbers of T, B, and NK cells via flow cytometry, quantitative immunoglobulin levels (IgG, IgM, and IgA), Tetramer/ELISPOT CTL frequencies to CMV/EBV immunodominant antigens, V beta T cell spectratyping, and VEGF levels via ELISA.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 8 weeks.",

Vincristine is designed to interfere with the multiplication of cancer cells, which may slow or stop their growing and spreading throughout the body. This may cause the cancer cells to die. Liposomal vincristine is formed when vincristine is placed inside of oil droplets called liposomes, which may help to improve the delivery of drug to the tumor site. The liposomal formulation results in a slow, steady release of vincristine in the tumor metastasis, exposing the cancer cells to vincristine continuously.\n\nThe goal of this clinical research study is to learn if Marqibo (liposomal vincristine) can help to control metastatic uveal melanoma. The safety of liposomal vincristine will also be studied.\n\nApproximately 50 patients will take part in this study.",

The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as the cohort in which \\< 33% of subjects (ie, 0/3 or 1/6 subjects in a cohort) experienced DLT.

For apheresis, whole blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and circulated through a cell-separating machine where the stem cells are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. Bone marrow harvesting is done under general anesthesia. Stem cells are collected through a large needle inserted into the hipbone.-Patients' immune system cells and bone marrow function are eliminated with chemotherapy (7 days) and total body irradiation (3 days) so the patient's immune system cells will not fight the tumor-fighting cells they are given in treatment.\n\n* 1 to 3 days after total body irradiation, patients receive the tumor-fighting cells by intravenous (IV) infusion. After the cells are infused, they receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) infusions every 8 hours for 5 days.\n* 2 days after infusion of the tumor-fighting cells, patients receive the stem cells collected earlier by apheresis.\n* Patients are evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after cell infusion to look for tumor response to treatment. Patients whose tumor has not grown return to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) every 1 to 3 months for blood tests, scans and x-rays.",

Complete clinical responses have not been significantly improved over other adoptive cell therapy regimens.\n\nThus, in this trial we would like to more adequately test our hypothesis that more intensive lymphodepletion will increase complete responses and persistence of the transferred cells.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo determine whether tumor reactive lymphocytes infused in conjunction with the administration of high-dose IL-2 in patients who have received prior therapy with IL-2 and those who have not may result in complete clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma receiving a myeloablative lymphoid depleting preparative regimen.\n\nTo evaluate the safety of the treatment in patients receiving the myeloablative conditioning regimen, cell transfer and IL-2.\n\nTo determine the survival in patients, of infused cells following the administration of the myeloablative regimen, using analysis of the sequence of the variable region of the T cell receptor or flow cytometry (FACS).\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients who are greater than or equal to 18 years of age who have tumor reactive cells available, with metastatic melanoma, and are physically able to tolerate high-dose IL-2.\n\nDesign:\n\nPatients will be assigned to one of two cohorts, those having received prior therapy with IL-2 and those who have not.\n\nPatients will receive a myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day x 2 days IV), fludarabine (25mg/m\\^2/day IV X 5 days) and 1200 cGy total body irradiation (TBI).\n\nPatients will receive intravenous adoptive transfer of tumor reactive lymphocytes (minimum 3 X 10 (9) and up to a maximum of 3 X 10(11) lymphocytes) followed by high-dose intravenous (IV) IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hours for up to 15 doses).\n\nOn day 1 of patients will receive intravenous administration of cryopreserved autologous CD34+ cells.\n\nA complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 4-6 weeks after cell infusion.

The cancer vaccine CDX-1401 attaches to a protein that is made in tumor cells. The vaccine helps the body recognize the tumor to fight the cancer. The biologic drug CDX-301 may help the body make more of the tumor fighting cells, known as dendritic cells. Another biologic drug, poly-ICLC, may stimulate the immune system and help these dendritic cells mature so that they can recognize the tumor. Giving CDX-301 may make the immune response to a combination of CDX-1401 and poly-ICLC better.",

To determine whether the immune response to NY-ESO-1 elicited by vaccination with DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 (CDX-1401) plus polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC) is substantially increased by prior expansion in the number of circulating dendritic cells (DC) by therapy with recombinant Flt3 ligand (CDX-301) (fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand \\[Flt3L\\]).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the effect of the vaccine regimen on immune responses to other ongoing and nascent antitumor response antigens associated with melanoma (e.g., PRAME, MAGE-A3, p53, and gp100) as well as memory viral responses (influenza A) and chronic viral responses (cytomegalovirus \\[CMV\\], Epstein-Barr virus \\[EBV\\]).\n\nII. To assess the effect of the vaccine regimen on the frequency and phenotypic character of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) subsets including DCs, monocyte populations, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\n\nIII. To assess the safety, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of the vaccine regimens.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive recombinant Flt3 ligand (CDX-301) subcutaneously (SC) on days -7 to -1, 1-3, and 22-28 of cycle 1 and only on days 1-3 of cycle 2. Patients also receive CDX-1401 SC or intradermally (ID) on day 1 of each cycle and poly-ICLC SC on days 1-2 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive CDX-1401 and poly-ICLC as in Arm I. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 12 weeks and then annually thereafter.",

      "brief_summary": "This experiment will test the safety and effectiveness of a treatment for melanoma in which certain lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) are taken from the patient, grown in the laboratory, and returned after the patient's immune system has been weakened with immune-suppressing drugs. Some patients will also receive interleukin-2 (IL-2), a drug that may enhance the activity of the re-infused lymphocytes.\n\nPatients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma whose tumor has spread) who have been treated unsuccessfully with gp100 vaccination may participate in this study. They will undergo apheresis or a tumor biopsy, or both, to collect lymphocytes. In apheresis, whole blood is drawn through a needle in the arm. A machine separates the blood components and removes the white cells. The rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a needle in the other arm. A biopsy is a surgical procedure to remove a small piece of tumor tissue.\n\nSeveral weeks before the lymphocytes are collected, patients will receive injections of growth colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) every day for five days. This drug stimulates white cell production, permitting as many cells as possible to be obtained during collection. The lymphocytes will then be grown in larger numbers in the laboratory.\n\nSeven days before the cells are re-infused, the patient is admitted to the hospital and a catheter (small tube) is placed in a large vein in the chest or neck. Two drugs, cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, are given through the tube. These drugs suppress the immune system so that it will not interfere with the work of the reinfused lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are then injected through the catheter over a 30-minute period. After the infusion, patients who receive IL-2 will be given the drug in a high dose over a 15-minute period every eight hours for up to five days. Patients whose condition does not permit high-dose IL-2, such as those with a heart condition or lung problem, may receive a low-dose regimen, with the drug given as a shot under the skin of the thigh or abdomen for five days followed by a 2-day break, continuing for a total of six weeks. These patients receive a higher dose the first week and then half that dose the next five weeks.\n\nBlood and tissue samples will be taken before and during the study to evaluate the size of the tumor and assess treatment. If, 3-5 weeks after therapy is completed, the patient's tumor has stabilized or shrunk, the entire treatment, except for chemotherapy, may be repeated two more times.",

Patients who can tolerate high-dose aldesleukin will receive it with cell infusion; those who cannot tolerate high-dose will receive low-dose aldesleukin.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day X 2 days intravenous (IV)), fludarabine (25 mg/m\\^2/day IV X 5 days).\n* Patients will receive intravenous adoptive transfer of gp100:154-162 reactive peripheral blood lymphocytes (minimum 1 X 10\\^9) and up to a maximum of 3 X 10\\^11) lymphocytes) followed by high-dose intravenous (IV) aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hours for up to 15 doses) or low-dose subcutaneous (SQ) aldesleukin (125,000 IU IL-2/kg/dose for 5 days for 6 weeks with 2 days rest per week).\n* A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 4-6 weeks after the last dose of aldesleukin in the high dose arm and 2-4 weeks after the last dose of aldesleukin in the low dose arm. Patients will be enrolled into two cohorts. The cohort receiving high dose aldesleukin will be conducted using a small optimal two-stage Phase II design, initially 21 patients will be enrolled, and if two or more of the first 21 patients has a clinical response (partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)), accrual will continue to 41 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response. For the cohort who will receive low dose aldesleukin, the study will be conducted as a Minimax two-stage phase II trial. Initially 12 evaluable patients will be enrolled to this cohort, and if 1 or more the first 12 have a response, then accrual would continue until a total of 21 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response.",

      "detailed_description": "While recent advances in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) with agents targeting PD-1 are striking, there remains a significant need to develop therapies for patients with untreated brain metastases who were excluded from prior trials with MK-3475 and the majority of other studies in these diseases. The brain is a common site of disease spread in many solid tumors, most notably metastatic melanoma and NSCLC. 10-40% of patients with metastatic melanoma develop brain metastases during their lifetime and \\>75% have brain metastases at autopsy. Overall, historical melanoma patient cohorts have reported a median survival of patients with brain metastases in the order of 2.5 - 4 months despite use of whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and surgery. One older patient series showed a median survival of \\< 4 months in melanoma patients with brain metastases and a neurological death rate of \\>30% despite the treatment of intracranial metastases with whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT). Among those with NSCLC, 10% have brain metastases at presentation and another 30% develop them over the course of their disease. Survival after the development of brain metastases is as dismal in those with NSCLC as it is for melanoma. Multifocal disease is common in both of these diseases, with about half of patients with CNS disease presenting with more than one brain lesion.\n\nPatients with untreated brain metastases have been excluded from most clinical trials of systemic therapy for two reasons: (1) historically their prognosis has been poor (overall survival ≤ 4 months) and (2) experimental drugs are presumed to not penetrate the blood brain barrier (BBB) or BBB penetration is not well studied. In melanoma, for example, one phase III study evaluating ipilimumab excluded patients with untreated brain metastases and another study evaluating ipilimumab and dacarbazine excluded all patients with a history of brain metastases, regardless of prior treatment. A subsequent trial with ipilimumab for patients with untreated brain metastases indeed showed that the drug had some activity in treating CNS disease. In the initial vemurafenib studies, patients with progressing or unstable CNS metastases were excluded. The pivotal BRIM-3 trial excluded patients with brain metastases unless metastases had been definitively treated more than three months prior to trial enrollment. Both temodar and sorafenib cross the BBB. Initial studies with sorafenib alone and in combination with chemotherapy excluded patients with active brain metastases. A combination study of temodar and sorafenib in patients with or without brain metastases showed modest activity in patients without a history of prior temodar, and was thought to be favorable in part due to local therapies. Although a number of studies have been conducted for melanoma patients with untreated brain metastases using established therapies, most initial clinical trials with novel agents exclude these patients. A recent trial with dabrafenib, an inhibitor of mutated B-raf, is an exception to the long-standing paradigm. A phase I/II study of this agent included a subset of patients with untreated brain metastases. At the 2010 meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology, Long et al reported that nine of the ten patients with untreated cerebral metastases enrolled in this trial had shrinkage of their brain lesions. This was the basis for a recent phase II trial of dabrafenib specific for patients with untreated brain metastases61. In NSCLC, a small number of trials have shown that combination chemotherapy regimens can induce a response in the CNS with untreated brain metastases with a median PFS up to 4 months. These studies demonstrate that asymptomatic brain metastases, similar to asymptomatic metastases in other sites, can be treated systemically on clinical trials, and that drug activity in the CNS is not necessarily different than in other metastatic locations.\n\nCurrent standard of care for brain metastases that require immediate local intervention (based on symptoms, location, size, or other concerning features) is craniotomy with resection or radiation therapy. As an adjunct to standard craniotomy, LITT is emerging as a new, minimally invasive local therapy to treat previously surgically inaccessible brain metastases. Not only is cell death instantaneous, thus decreasing the risk of delayed intra-tumoral hemorrhage, but another theoretical advantage of using LITT as part of management of brain metastases is that the hyperthermia breaks down the blood brain barrier at the edge of the coagulation region thereby possibly increasing access of chemotherapeutic agents into the lesion. In patients in whom either craniotomy or LITT are performed, biopsies of tumor and surrounding normal brain can also be obtained at the time of local therapy.\n\nThe purpose of this trial is to study the activity of MK-3475 in untreated brain metastases from melanoma or NSCLC. Given the promising initial results of MK-3475 in these diseases but the lack of data in patients with untreated brain metastases thus far, this trial will study treatment in this patient population. Additionally, for patients with melanoma this trial requires local therapy with craniotomy or LITT to at least 1 brain lesion prior to systemic therapy, thereby allowing the acquisition of brain tumor tissue for correlative studies on biomarkers that may be predictive of clinical response in the CNS and systemically. There will also be a biopsy of an extra-cerebral metastasis when feasible, particularly when tissue from the brain lesion is not obtained in patients with NSCLC.\n\nUpon results entry, the primary outcome measure was aligned as originally presented in the study protocol (attached with results).",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Biopsy proven metastatic melanoma or NSCLC as follows:\n\n   1. Patients with metastatic melanoma must have untreated brain metastases including:\n\n      * At least one cerebral metastasis that requires local intervention and is amenable to craniotomy or LITT therapy either due to symptoms, lesion size, location, edema or hemorrhage (\"surgical lesion\"). Alternatively, a patient may be eligible if a cerebral metastasis was resected or biopsied any time prior to enrollment and there is tumor tissue available for analysis.\n      * At least one cerebral metastasis that is at least 5 mm AND twice the MRI slice thickness, but less than 20 mm, that is asymptomatic and does not require local therapy at the time of enrollment (\"clinically evaluable lesion(s)\"). OR\n   2. Patients with stage IV NSCLC with at least one cerebral metastasis that is at least 5 mm AND twice the MRI slice thickness, but less than 20 mm, that is asymptomatic and does not require local therapy at the time of enrollment (\"clinically evaluable lesion(s)\").\n2. Age ≥18\n3. ECOG performance status \\< 2\n4. Any number of previous treatments with the exception of previous inhibitors of PD-1, PD-L1, or PD-L2; other prior systemic therapies must have been administered at least 2 weeks before administration of MK-3475 with the exception of bevacizumab which must have been administered at least 4 weeks prior to MK-3475. Patients are not required to have had prior systemic therapy. The exception to this is patients with NSCLC who test negative for PD-L1 expression or are unevaluable for PD-L1 expression must have received prior platinum-based chemotherapy for entry into Cohort 2. Note: Ipilimumab treatment should have been administered at least 4 weeks prior to the start of MK-3475.\n5. Life expectancy of at least 3 months\n6. A history of previously treated brain metastases is allowed, provided that at least 14 days have lapsed between radiation and initiation of MK-3475. Any lesion present at the time of WBRT or included in the stereotactic radiotherapy field (or within 2mm of the treated lesion) will NOT be considered evaluable unless it is new or documented to have progressed since treatment.\n7. PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue from any site is required for patients with NSCLC for entry into Cohort 1. Tumor tissue must be obtained after the last systemic therapy. PD-L1 expression will be analyzed by a Merck assay. For NSCLC Cohort 2, patients may test PD-L1 negative or may be unevaluable for PD-L1 expression (i.e. insufficient tumor tissue). PD-L1 expression is not required for patients with melanoma, but melanoma patients are required to submit an extra-cerebral specimen for analysis, unless it is not feasible to obtain one.\n8. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined per protocol.\n9. For women of childbearing potential, agreement to the use of two acceptable methods of contraception, including one barrier method, during the study and for 6 months after discontinuation of MK-3475.\n10. For men with female partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use a latex condom, and to advise their female partner to use an additional method of contraception during the study and for 6 months after discontinuation of MK-3475.\n11. Negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 72 hours of commencement of treatment in premenopausal women.\n12. Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Symptomatic brain metastases. Symptoms may be present from the surgical lesion prior to resection or LITT but must have resolved by the time of administration of study drug.\n2. Patients with brain metastases for whom complete surgical resection is clinically appropriate.\n3. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy to the lung or brain within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent. Previous radiation to other sites may be completed at any time prior to initiation of MK-3475.\n\n   1. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.\n   2. Note: Toxicity that has not recovered to ≤ Grade 1 is allowed if it meets the inclusion requirements for laboratory parameters.\n4. Has had prior treatment with any other anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 or PD-L2 agent or an antibody targeting other immune-regulatory receptors or mechanisms. Examples of such antibodies include (but are not limited to) antibodies against IDO, PD-L1, IL-2R, GITR. Prior ipilimumab, IL2, bevacizumab and adoptive cell therapy is allowed.\n5. The use of corticosteroids to control cerebral edema or treat neurologic symptoms will not be allowed, and patients who previously required corticosteroids for symptom control must be off steroids for at least 2 weeks. Low-dose steroid use (≤10 mg of prednisone or equivalent) as corticosteroid replacement therapy is allowed\n6. Has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n7. Presence of leptomeningeal disease\n8. Has an active automimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that require intermittent use of inhaled steroids or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.\n9. Pregnancy or breast feeding. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n   Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with MK-3475, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with MK-3475.\n10. Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents and may not have participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n11. Either a concurrent condition (including medical illness, such as active infection requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics or the presence of laboratory abnormalities) or history of a prior condition that places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were treated with the study drug or a medical condition that confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.\n12. Concurrent, active malignancies in addition to those being studied (other than cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or basal cell carcinoma)\n13. Any contraindication to MRI (i.e. patients with pacemakers or other metal implanted medical devices). An MRI safety questionnaire is required prior to MR imaging.\n14. Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis\n15. Has a known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B (HBV), or Hepatitis C (HCV) infection.\n16. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n17.

      "brief_summary": "Temozolomide (also known as TMZ) is a chemotherapy drug given by mouth. It is similar to DTIC, the only FDA-approved chemotherapy for melanoma, but because temozolomide is given by mouth, it can be given daily over a long period of time. We think that temozolomidemay work best if it is given every day for 6 weeks at a time. Temozolomide given by this extended schedule is experimental, although we have found that it is safe and can shrink melanoma in some patients.\n\nOne big advantage of TMZ is that it is given by mouth instead of by vein. This means that it can be given daily over a long period of time rather than off and on like DTIC. We think that TMZ may work better if it is given every day for 6 weeks. TMZ given by this extended schedule is experimental although we have found that TMZ given in this way is safe and can shrink melanoma in some patients. When extended dosing TMZ was given with either thalidomide or long-acting interferon-α, about 30% of patients had their tumors shrink. We think that this shrinkage was due mostly to the TMZ since neither thalidomide nor interferon-α alpha work in melanoma by themselves.\n\nIn this study, we will treat patients with TMZ alone using this extended dosing schedule to see how many patients experience tumor shrinkage.\n\nWe also want to learn more about which tumors are more likely to shrink from TMZ treatment. We will test samples of your tumor for whether or not a gene called MGMT has been turned on,",

      "phase": "PHASE2",
      "condition": "Melanoma",
      "intervention": "Glycoprotein 100 (GP100): 209-217 (210M); Interleukin-2 (IL-2); Montanide ISA 51; Melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART)-1: 27-35; 27-35 (27L): melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART)-1; melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART)-1: 26-35(27L)",
      "brief_summary": "This study will examine the effectiveness and side effects of an experimental vaccine to prevent recurrence of melanoma. The likelihood of melanoma returning is higher in patients who have melanoma lesions deep in the skin, in patients who have had positive lymph nodes, and in patients who have had surgery for metastatic disease (cancer that has spread beyond the primary site). Melanoma tumors produce proteins called glycoprotein 100 (gp100) and melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1). Vaccination with specific pieces of these proteins (peptides) may boost the immune system's fight against the cancer. The vaccine injections are mixed with an oil-based substance called Montanide ISA-51, which is intended to increase the immune response to the peptide.\n\nPatients 16 years of age and older whose melanoma has been surgically removed and who are currently free of disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests. An electrocardiogram (EKG), x-rays and other imaging studies will be done if recent results are not available. Some candidates may require heart tests, such as a cardiac stress test or echocardiogram, or lung function tests. In addition, all candidates will be tested for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue type; patients must be type human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A)\\*0201, the type on which this vaccine is based.\n\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to receive one of four different vaccines to determine which peptides offer the best immunity. Each treatment course consists of two injections of the vaccines every 3 weeks for four times. The injections are given under the skin of the thigh. After every other treatment course (every 6 months), patients will undergo a series of x-rays and scans to look for tumor. The immunizations may continue for up to 12 months as long as the melanoma does not return. The injections are given at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. Patients are monitored for 1 hour after each injection and have blood tests and a physical examination to look for treatment side effects.\n\nPatients will be followed with blood tests every 12 weeks to monitor body functions. They will also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure to collect white blood cells-before starting treatment and about 3 to 4 weeks after the fourth vaccine to evaluate how the vaccines affect the action of the immune system cells. For this procedure, blood is drawn through a needle in the arm, similar to donating blood. The blood goes through a machine that separates out the lymphocytes (white blood cells), and the rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Some patients may undergo a biopsy-surgical removal of a small piece of tissue under local anesthetic-of normal skin and tumor or lymph node tissue to examine the effects of the vaccines on the tumor immune cells.\n\nPatients whose disease returns during the first course of vaccine therapy will have surgery to remove the tumor and will continue to receive the vaccine treatment. Patients whose tumor returns after completing one course of therapy may receive a substance called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which can boost immune function against the tumor. interleukin-2 (IL-2) is given intravenously (through a small tube placed in a vein) every 8 hours for 4 days. This regimen is repeated after 10 to 14 days. Those who respond to interleukin-2 (IL-2) will have a third course of treatment after 2 months. Patients whose disease recurs after treatment will be taken off the study and will be referred back to their referring physician or to another study, if an appropriate one is available.",

A retroviral vector was constructed that can deliver the T-cell receptor (TCR) to cells.\n* Patients' cells will be converted into cells able to recognize and fight melanoma tumors.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To determine whether TCR-engineered lymphocytes can be put in cells removed from patients' tumors or blood and then reinfused, with the purpose of shrinking tumors.\n* To evaluate safety and effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic cancer melanoma (cancer that has spread beyond the original site).\n* Patient's leukocyte antigen type is HLA-A 0201.\n\nDesign:\n\n-Patients undergo the following procedures:\n\n* Leukapheresis (on two occasions). This is a method of collecting large numbers of white blood cells. The cells obtained in the first leukapheresis procedure are grown in the laboratory, and the anti-MART-1 protein is inserted into the cells using an inactivated (harmless) virus in a process called retroviral transduction. Cells collected in the second leukapheresis procedure are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the study treatment.\n* Chemotherapy. Patients are given chemotherapy through a vein (intravenously, IV) over 1 hour for 2 days to suppress the immune system so that the patient's immune cells do not interfere with the treatment.\n* Treatment with anti-melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART)-1. Patients receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of the treated cells containing anti-MART-1 protein, followed by infusions of a drug called IL-2 (aldesleukin), which helps boost the effectiveness of the treated white cells.\n* Patients are given support medications to prevent complications such as infections.\n* Patients may undergo a tumor biopsy (removal of a small piece of tumor tissue).\n* Patients are evaluated with laboratory tests and imaging tests, such as CT (computed tomography) scans, 4 to 6 weeks after treatment and then once a month for 3 to 4 months to determine the response to treatment.\n* Patients have blood tests at 3, 6, and 12 months and then annually for 5 years.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* We have engineered human TIL (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) to express an anti-MART-1 T-cell receptor that recognizes an HLA-A\\*0201 restricted epitope derived from the TIL clone DMF5.\n* We constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both alpha and beta chains and can mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency without the need to perform any selection.\n* In co-cultures with HLA-A\\*0201 positive melanoma, anti-MART-1 F5 TCR transduced T cells secreted significant amount of interferon (IFN)-gamma (but no significant secretion was observed in control co-cultures with cell lines.\n* The anti-MART-1 F5 TCR transduced T-cells could efficiently kill HLA-A\\*0201 positive tumors. There was little or no recognition of normal fibroblasts cells.\n* This TCR is over 10 times more reactive with melanoma cells than the MART-1 TCR that mediated tumor regression in two patients with metastatic melanoma.\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary objectives:\n\n-Determine if the administration of anti-MART-1 F5 TCR -engineered peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) or tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and aldesleukin to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen will result in clinical tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\n* Determine the in vivo survival of TCR gene-engineered cells.\n* Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients who are HLA-A 0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have:\n\n* metastatic melanoma;\n* previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred after aldesleukin;\n* normal values for basic laboratory values.\n\nPatients may not have:\n\n* concurrent major medical illnesses;\n* any form of primary or secondary immunodeficiency;\n* severe hypersensitivity to any of the agents used in this study;\n* contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.\n\nDesign:\n\n* If TIL can be obtained and grown, but are non-reactive, patients will be assigned to receive TIL transduced with the anti-MART-1 F5 TCR retroviral vector. If TIL cannot be obtained, PBMC will be obtained by leukapheresis (approximately 5 X 10(9) cells) and cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and aldesleukin and transduced with the anti-MART-1 F5 TCR retroviral vector. If TIL cells are reactive to autologous tumor or major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched tumor cells or PBL cannot be grown, patients will not be treated on this protocol.\n* Transduction is initiated by exposure of approximately 10(8) to 5 times 10(8) cells to retroviral vector supernatant containing the anti-MART-1 F5 TCR genes. These transduced cells will be expanded and tested for their anti-tumor activity.\n* Once engineered lymphocytes are demonstrated to be biologically active according to the strict criteria outlined in the Certificate of Analysis, patients will receive a nonmyeloablative but lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine followed by intravenous infusion of ex vivo tumor reactive, TCR gene transduced cells plus IV aldesleukin (720,000 IU/kg q8h for a maximum of 15 doses).\n* Patients will undergo complete evaluation of tumor with physical examination, CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and clinical laboratory evaluation four to six weeks after treatment and then monthly for approximately 3 to 4 months or until off study criteria are met.\n* The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design where initially 21 evaluable patients will be enrolled into each of two cohorts. If 0 or 1 of the 21 patients per cohort experiences a clinical response, then no further patients will be enrolled but if 2 or more of the first 21 evaluable patients enrolled in that cohort have a clinical response, then accrual to that cohort will continue until a total of 41 evaluable patients have been enrolled in that cohort.\n* The objective will be to determine in two cohorts if the combination of high dose aldesleukin, lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-MART-1 F5 TCR-gene engineered lymphocytes (TIL and PBL) is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% PR (partial response) + CR (complete response) rate (p1=0.20).",

It will be the responsibility of the local participating investigators to obtain the necessary local clearance, and to indicate in writing to the NCIC CTG Study Coordinator that such clearance has been obtained, before the trial can commence in that centre. Because of differing requirements, a standard consent form for the trial will not be provided but a sample form is given in Appendix VII. A copy of the initial REB approval and approved consent form must be sent to the central office. The patient must sign the consent form prior to randomization. Please note that the consent form for this study must contain a statement which gives permission for qualified representatives of the NCIC CTG, BMS, ZymoGenetics, the company collaborator, and regulatory authorities to review patient records (see section 16 for further details) and a statement which gives permission for NCIC CTG to access and study tissue for biomarker assessments.\n* Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients randomized on this trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 2 hour's driving distance) placed on patients being considered for this trial.\n* In accordance with NCIC CTG policy, protocol treatment is to begin within 5 working days of patient randomization.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with known HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection.\n* History of other malignancies, except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ cancer of the cervix, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence of disease for \\> 5 years.\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, other interventional cardiac procedure within the past 12 months, autoimmune conditions requiring chronic immunosuppressive therapy, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Patients may not have received any other investigational agents within 28 days of study entry, and may not receive concurrent treatment with other anti-cancer therapy or investigational agents while on protocol therapy.\n* Patients with known brain metastases or history of CNS metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. A head CT or MRI is required on all patients to rule out brain metastases.\n* Pregnant or lactating women. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with rIL-21 or dacarbazine, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with protocol therapy.\n* Prohibited Medications: Long Term (\\> 7 days) Systemic Corticosteroids (e.g. prednisone, dexamethasone, etc.) because these may counteract the stimulatory effects of rIL-21 on lymphocytes.

In the pembrolizumab + PEG-IFN study arms, qualified participants who receive the first course but experience disease progression after discontinuing pembrolizumab with stable disease or better may, at the investigator's discretion, initiate a second course of pembrolizumab at the same dose and schedule for up to 17 doses (up to \\~1 additional year). Per protocol, response or progression during the second course will not count towards efficacy outcome measure and adverse events during the second course will not count towards safety outcome measures.\n\nPart 2 (MEL and RCC) is a randomized portion of the trial and will evaluate preliminary efficacy of the drug combinations for advanced MEL participants.

After 8 weeks, if you have melanoma lesions, you will apply R848 to half of the lesions on your body for 16 weeks.\n* If you are in Group 2, you will receive only the vaccines (gp100(g209-2M) and MAGE-3) only for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, if you have melanoma lesions, you will apply R848 to half of the lesions on your body for 16 weeks.\n* If you are in Group 3, you will receive the vaccines gp100(g209-2M) and MAGE-3 and R848 for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, if you have melanoma lesions, you will apply R848 to half of the lesions on your body for 16 weeks.\n\nAfter 8 weeks, if you no longer have melanoma lesions, you will have completed the study treatment.\n\nStudy Drug/Vaccine Administration:\n\nOnce a week for 8 weeks, you will receive the vaccines, gp100(g209-2M) and MAGE-3, intradermally (through a needle into your skin) and subcutaneously (through a needle under your skin) at 2 separate sites in separate extremities. Half of each dose will be given one way, and half given the other way. These vaccines will also be given on the same day. You will receive a total of 4 injections each week.\n\nIf you are in Group 1, every time you have the vaccine injection, R848 will be applied as a gel over the gp100(g209-2M) injection site. The R848 gel will be allowed to air dry for 30 minutes and then covered with a gauze dressing which remain on overnight.\n\nAfter 8 weeks, for participants with melanoma lesions, 2 times a week for 16 weeks, you will apply the R848 gel to half of the lesions on your body. You will be given written instructions and a \"hands-on\" demonstration on how to apply the gel. You will also be given a worksheet to help you with applying the gel.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nOne day after your first dose of vaccine (Day 2), you will have a punch biopsy of the vaccine injection site to check your immune system. A punch biopsy is when a hollow instrument that is used to remove a small coin-shaped sample of tissue.\n\nAt Week 2, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to study your immune response to the vaccine combinations.\n* You will have a punch biopsy of the injection site to check your immune system the day after the vaccine is given.\n\nEvery 4 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.\n* Your performance status will be recorded.\n* Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n* Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to study your immune response to the vaccine combinations.\n\nEvery 8 weeks, for participants with metastatic disease, the following tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n* You will have CT or PET/CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status of the disease.\n* The tumors will be measured and photographed. Your private areas will be covered (as much as possible), and a picture of your face will not be taken unless there are tumors on your face.\n* If the doctor thinks it is necessary, the tumors will be measured by CT scan.\n* If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an MRI/CT of the brain to check the status of the disease.\n\nThe day after you first start the gel (Week 8), you will have 2 punch tumor biopsies to check your immune system. One biopsy will be of a lesion with the R848 and one without, if it is available. For participants without disease, the study will be completed and your follow-up will be decided by your doctor.\n\nAt Week 0 (before vaccine is started), after treatment at Week 8 (+/- 1 week)., and Week 16 (+/- 1 week), white blood cells will be collected by leukapheresis to test for antibodies. If you have the leukapheresis, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn as well. If you do not have leukapheresis, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn instead.\n\nThe leukapheresis procedure is research-related and would not be performed as standard of care if you were not on study. Blood for the leukapheresis will be taken through a needle in a vein in one of your arms. A solution will be added to keep your blood from clotting while it goes through the machine that collects and removes white blood cells from your blood. The remaining blood is returned to you through a needle in a vein of your other arm. This is may take up to 3-4 hours. Although several pints of blood will go through the machine, only about 1/2 a pint (1 cup) will be in the machine at any time. If you cannot have a needle in your vein, this blood will be removed thorough a central venous catheter (CVC). A CVC is a sterile flexible tube that will be placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. You will be given another informed consent document to sign, which describes the risks of the CVC and the care involved.\n\nLength of Study:\n\nYou will continue to receive treatment for up to 4 6 months, as long as you may benefit from the study and are responding to the gel. You will be taken off study if the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects. If you are in the group without disease, you will not receive the study treatment.\n\nFollow-Up:\n\nAll three groups will be called 1 time a month for 12 months after coming off the study drugs to check on the status of the disease.\n\nThis is an investigational study. The study drugs/vaccines gp100(g209-2M), MAGE-3, and R848 are not FDA approved or commercially available. At this time, they are only being used in research.\n\nUp to 71 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",

Placing chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) into lymphocytes (white blood cells) may help the body build an immune response to kill melanoma cells. Aldesleukin may enhance this effect by stimulating white blood cells to kill more melanoma cells.

Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for their growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of malignant melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temsirolimus together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.",

Treatment repeats every 14 days for a maximum of 26 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo tumor resection on day 9 of course 2.Blood samples are collected during courses 1 and 2. Samples are examined by flow cytometry to evaluate peripheral blood mononuclear cells for molecular effects of study agents. Patients also undergo normal and tumor tissue biopsy (by core needle biopsy, incisional biopsy, or surgical resection) during courses 1 and 2. Samples are examined by immunohistochemistry, western blotting, protein array technology, gene expression analyses, DNA mutation analyses, and genomic analyses for pre-and post-treatment measurements of target molecules (epidermal growth factor receptor, B-Raf, MEK, MAPK), downstream pathway components (PI-3 kinase, AKT, mTOR), markers of angiogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis, markers that may modulate cell signaling or the response to investigational agents, and vascular and immune system parameters.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for up to 2 years, and then periodically for up to 5 years.",

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy, work in different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Autologous stem cell transplant may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and biological therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving cyclophosphamide and fludarabine together with radiation therapy followed by cellular adoptive immunotherapy, autologous stem cell transplant, and interleukin-2 works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.",

      "detailed_description": "This study consisted of a Screening period, conducted up to 4 months before randomisation, followed by three phases: a 16-week, double blind (DB), randomised, placebo-controlled phase; a 32-week initial open label (IOL) phase; and a long term open label extension (LTOLE) phase.\n\nThe DB phase evaluated lanreotide Autogel versus placebo in subjects with a history of carcinoid syndrome (flushing and/or diarrhoea). This was followed by a 32-week IOL phase in which all subjects received lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks. Subjects in countries where lanreotide Autogel had not been approved for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome, who were well-controlled at the end of the 32-week IOL phase and chose to continue to receive lanreotide Autogel, were given the option of participating in a LTOLE phase. The LTOLE phase of the study was planned to end at least 2 years after the last subject had completed his/her participation in the 32-week IOL phase or when marketing approval for the treatment of symptoms of carcinoid syndrome had been obtained in the respective countries (whichever occurred first) or at any time the study was terminated by the Sponsor. The actual overall duration of the study was 6.5 years. During the LTOLE phase all subjects continued to be treated with lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks.\n\nThe study planned to enrol approximately 100 adult subjects worldwide.

In the adapted pyrexia management algorithm, dabrafenib and trametinib were interrupted promptly at the onset of pyrexia (≥38°C) and were restarted upon the improvement of symptoms at the same dose if patients remained symptom free (temperature \\<38°C) for at least 24 hours. In addition, dabrafenib and trametinib could be interrupted in the presence of pyrexia syndrome (i.e. chills, rigours, night sweats, or influenza-like symptoms) without documented temperature ≥38°C for cases of suspected recurrent pyrexia, at the investigators' discretion.\n2. Follow-up Period - patients were followed for disease relapse through 24 months from first dose date. Moreover, patients were followed for overall survival through withdrawal, lost to follow-up, death, or the end of study, whichever occurs first. The follow-up period started once treatment was completed or treatment was prematurely discontinued.",

To determine the relapse-free survival, overall survival and the impact of tumor response to chemotherapy in these patients.\n3. To differentiate the in vivo treatment effects of TMZ alone vs.TMZ plus PGI and correlate with clinical outcome by analysis the pre- and post-treatment tumors and peripheral blood mononuclear cells with respect to:\n\n1) Known cellular and molecular markers of apoptosis and cell proliferation, 2) Promotor methylation status of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), 3) DNA sequence variability of tumor suppressor genes and DNA repair enzymes, 4) Tumor genomic expression profiles analysis by complementary DNA (cDNA) microarray and protein array",
      "detailed_description": "Temozolomide is a drug that is designed to work by stopping cancer cells from making new DNA. If they cannot make DNA, they can't split into 2 new cancer cells.\n\nPegylated Interferon alpha-2b is a protein made by the human immune system that helps to fight viral infections and regulate cell function.\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two treatment groups (Arm A or Arm B). You have an equal chance of being assigned to either group and getting the treatment assigned to that group. You will not know which group you are assigned to.\n\nArm A: Participants in this group will take temozolomide once a day for 7 days in a row. This will be followed by 7 days without any treatment. This will be repeated 3 more times(for a total of 8 weeks - 1 cycle) before you have routine surgery.\n\nArm B: Participants in this group will take temozolomide on the same schedule as those in Arm A. However, participants in this group will also receive pegylated interferon alpha-2b as an injection under the skin once a week for a total of 8 weeks before they have routine surgery. Tylenol will be given to participants in this group before their pegylated interferon alpha-2b injection. After the first injection, they will also need to stay in the clinic for 2 hours of observation.\n\nYour body weight will be used when calculating the dosage of Temozolomide.\n\nYou will have blood (about 1 tablespoon each time) drawn at 2 times, to check your response to treatment. The first sample will be drawn before you start treatment. The second sample will be drawn around Day 57 of treatment.\n\nOn Days 15, 29, 43, and 57 of treatment, you will be asked about any illness you have experienced and any medications you may be taking. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs. You will have tumor measurements and a performance status evaluation. You will also have about 1 tablespoon of blood drawn for routine tests at each visit . Any side effects you may have experienced will also be recorded.\n\nAll participants will receive 1 cycle (8 weeks) of treatment followed by surgery to remove the tumor. The size of the tumor will be closely monitored during study treatment. If the tumor increases in size by 50% (half) or greater, study treatment will be stopped and you will immediately have surgery. If you have to stop treatment due to side effects from the drug(s), you may be able to start up again once the side effect has gone away or decreased in severity enough. However, the time you are off therapy will count towards the total 8 weeks that you can receive treatment. If recovery from the side effect requires a total of 8 weeks or more from the start of treatment, you will be removed from the study and receive surgery. Tumor and blood samples will be collected during surgery to check how the disease is responding to treatment.\n\nYour routine surgery will be scheduled to take place up to 90 days following completion of your treatment and as soon as your blood counts have recovered to the normal level.\n\nAfter surgery, if you are experiencing side effects from the study drugs, but show stable disease or you are responding to treatment, you will be able to receive 3 additional cycles of therapy (24 weeks). You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs and routine blood tests (about 1 tablespoon) every 4 weeks. You will then be followed every 3 months with routine blood tests (about 1 tablespoon each time) for the first 3 years, and every 6 months up to 8 years. After that, follow-up will be at the discretion of your primary physician. CT scans of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be performed after each cycle of therapy for the 3 additional cycles, then every 6 months up to 5 years and then, at the discretion of your primary physician.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Temozolomide alone and given with pegylated interferon alpha-2b is authorized for use in research only. Neither of these drugs is currently approved by the FDA for this treatment. About 124 patients will be enrolled on this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.",

      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) therapies have had clinical success in a minority of unselected patients across multiple tumor types\n* While many questions remain about optimal PD1/PDL1 staining techniques to pre-select responders, less focus is being place on how to optimize responses in a broader cohort of patients\n* Emerging preclinical and clinical data supports the hypothesis that a strong immunologic response in the tumor microenvironment induces PDL1 expression on the tumor and is associated with better clinical response to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapies\n* Therapeutic cancer vaccines are one strategy to induce an immunologic response to the tumor, thereby enhancing PDL1 expression and optimizing clinical responses across all patients\n* Limited clinical data exists about the potential benefit of sequential therapy with a therapeutic cancer vaccine followed by PD1/PDL1 inhibition\n* This study will explore the role of PD1 inhibition in medullary thyroid cancer and evaluate the potential differences based on previous vaccine therapy\n\nObjective:\n\n-The primary objective of this trial is to determine whether administering a PD1 inhibitor to patients with medullary thyroid cancer will permit a modest fraction to be able to experience a 50% or greater decline in calcitonin levels or experience a partial/complete response on imaging\n\nKey Eligibility:\n\n* Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with evidence of metastatic medullary thyroid cancer including disease that is evaluable on bone, computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n* Must have elevated calcitonin levels greater than 40 pg/mL\n* Patients with minimal or no disease related-symptoms (minimal symptoms will include those that do not affect activities of daily living or pain that does not require regularly schedule narcotics)\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0-1\n* Should have no autoimmune diseases; no evidence of being immunocompromised; no serious inter-current medical illness\n* No brain metastasis, history of seizures, encephalitis, or multiple sclerosis\n\nDesign:\n\n* This is a phase II, open label, single center clinical trial where all patients receive the anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy pembrolizumab\n* Patients will enroll in one of two cohorts: patients with previous vaccine therapy or patients without previous vaccine therapy\n* All patients will be TKI naive with minimal symptoms (consistent with the eligibility for our current study)\n* Based on our calcitonin findings with our current study of 30 patients, we have determined that a confirmed calcitonin decline of 50% would be a rare finding, providing compelling preliminary evidence of clinical activity\n* A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in the proposed study (15 patients in each cohort). Given that we already have 30 patients on a study with vaccine, we would only need to identify and recruit 15 patients for the vaccine-naive cohort.\n* Based on these metrics, we could have \\>6 months of calcitonin data in 30 patients within 2 years from trial initiation\n* Additional immune correlative capitalizing on the extensive immune monitoring experience of the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) will allow for assessments of antigen specific T-cells and 123 immune subsets. These findings could provide the basis for biomarker development when taken together with biochemical and clinical responses seen in this study",

      "detailed_description": "Palonosetron is designed to work by blocking the substance serotonin from binding to the brain and gastrointestinal tract, which may help to decrease nausea and vomiting.\n\nParticipants in this study will be receiving biochemotherapy treatment as part of their routine care. This treatment will include 3 chemotherapy drugs (cisplatin, vinblastine, and DTIC) and 2 drugs that stimulate the immune system (interferon and interleukin-2 (IL-2)). Biochemotherapy often causes nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Palonosetron will be given on this study to try to treat the side effects of biochemotherapy.\n\nIf you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of 2 treatment groups. You have an equal chance of being assigned to either group.\n\nParticipants in Group 1 will receive palonosetron by vein over a few minutes starting 30 minutes before receiving chemotherapy on Days 1 and 4 of therapy. Participants in Group 2 will receive palonosetron by vein over a few minutes on Days 1, 3, and 5.\n\nAll participants on this study will also receive Ativan by vein every 8 hours for 5 days. Ativan is given for additional control of nausea and it will also help to sedate you. In addition to palonosetron, you may be given standard anti-nausea medications such as lorazepam or compazine if you experience intolerable nausea and vomiting while on study.\n\nYou will also be asked to fill out a Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE) questionnaire every day for 7 days in a row. The questionnaire will ask about any nausea and/or vomiting you are experiencing and the effect of the therapy on your quality of life. You will stay in the hospital for at least 7 days while you receive treatment.\n\nAfter the first course of palonosetron given with biochemotherapy, your doctor will decide if you will receive additional courses of palonosetron or if you will be given another anti-nausea drug.\n\nIf your doctor does decide to have you continue on palonosetron, it will be given off study. Your participation in this study will be over after 1 course.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Palonosetron has been approved by FDA for control of nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. However, it has not been adequately evaluated for safety and effectiveness in patients receiving high dose interleukin-2 alone or in combination with chemotherapy. About 30 patients will take part in this study. All patients will enrolled at M. D. Anderson.",

Assess antitumor effects of nivolumab across selected childhood solid tumors in seven expansion cohorts (Parts B1-B6, B8); neuroblastoma (2 cohorts: measurable disease, metaiodobenzylguanidine \\[MIBG\\] positive only non-measurable disease), osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nV. Assess antitumor effects of nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab across selected childhood solid tumors in two dose combinations (Part D and Part E).\n\nVI. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab, including area under the curve (AUC), concentration maximum (Cmax), concentration minimum (Cmin), using intensive sampling.\n\nVII. Assess immunogenicity of nivolumab alone and in combination with ipilimumab by measuring anti-drug antibody (ADA) levels.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Conduct exploratory studies of the phenotypic and functional effects of nivolumab (alone and in combination with ipilimumab), as well as changes in antibodies to previously vaccinated viruses, in serum samples.\n\nII. Explore whether correlations exist between PD-L1 expression on tumor and antitumor effects of nivolumab (alone and in combination with ipilimumab) in pediatric solid tumors and to conduct exploratory studies of potential tumor associated biomarkers of response in tumor tissue (at least five out of the following markers: NRAS, BRAF, MEK, KIT, PDGF, TP53, RB1 and BRCA1, Akt phosphorylation, IL-17 or PD-L1).\n\nIII. Explore presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and their association with antitumor effects of nivolumab (alone and in combination with ipilimumab).\n\nIV. Conduct exploratory studies of the effect of nivolumab (alone or in combination with ipilimumab) on cytokine levels in serum samples.\n\nV. For Part E, determine tumor mutational burden of diagnostic specimens using FoundationOneCDx testing to explore immune- related gene expression or mutation and its association with antitumor response to nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of nivolumab followed by a phase II study.\n\nPART A (COMPLETED): Patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15.

      "detailed_description": "Everolimus (RAD001) has been in clinical development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ transplantation and has obtained marketing authorization (Certican®) for prophylaxis of rejection in renal and cardiac transplantation in a number of countries, including the majority of the European Union. Everolimus has been in development for patients with various malignancies since 2002. Everolimus 2.5mg, 5mg and 10mg tablets were approved under the trade name Afinitor® for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with Sutent® (sunitinib) or Nexavar® (sorafenib) in the US, EU and several other countries and is undergoing registration in other regions worldwide. Afinitor® was also recently approved for the treatment of patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS) who require therapeutic intervention but are not candidates for curative surgical resection. Everolimus is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act: 1. Directly on the tumor cells by inhibiting tumor cell growth and proliferation; and 2. Indirectly by inhibiting angiogenesis leading to reduced tumor vascularity.\n\nFor pediatric cancer patients, safety of RAD001 has been established in a phase 1 trial and the recommended phase II dose is 5 mg/m2 once daily. This existing pediatric data allows for inclusion of children in this phase 2 trial, which is an important consideration since some NF2 patients with the most aggressive clinical course present at school age.\n\nRAD001 was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of children and adults with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), a benign brain tumor associated with tuberous sclerosis (TS). Although surgical resection is effective at tumor reduction, serious complications may follow a radical resection, such as permanent deafness and facial nerve damage. Most importantly, the tumors often recur after surgery. Radiation therapy (RT) has been proposed as an alternative. However, its safety and efficacy in the NF2 population has not been established. A medical therapy option is desperately needed. This study is a single-center, 2-stage, phase II open-label study. All subjects will get RAD001 taken continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective of this study is to look at the objective response rate to RAD001 in patients with NF2-related tumors including cranial nerve schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas. Participation will consist of screening/baseline visit(s), Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, and 4; and up to 12 cycles and will include standard of care procedures such as medical history, vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, MRIs, audiograms, and laboratory tests. Novartis will provide the RAD001 free of charge to eligible study subjects. The primary efficacy response for study purposes will be a greater than or equal to 15% reduction in tumor volume in any of the target tumors (partial response). Complete disappearance of any of the target tumors will constitute a complete response (CR).",

for most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT; following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method\n* A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) agrees to use method(s) of contraception; for a teratogenic study drug and/or when there is insufficient information to assess teratogenicity, a highly effective method(s) of contraception (failure rate of \\< 1% per year) is required; the individual methods of contraception and duration should be determined in consultation with the investigator; WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the study drug is \\> 24 hours; contraception should be continued for a period of 30 days plus the time required for the study drug to undergo 5 half-lives; WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 24 weeks (30 days plus the time required for study drug to undergo 5 half-lives) after the last dose of study drug; WOCBP must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \\[HCG\\]) within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product\n* Women must not be breastfeeding\n* Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year; the investigator shall review contraception methods and the time period that contraception must be followed; men who are sexually active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half-life of the study drug is \\> 24 hours, contraception should be continued for 90 days plus the time required for the study drug to undergo 5 half-lives; therefore, men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 33 weeks (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab and/or relatlimab to undergo 5 half-lives) after the last dose of study drug; in addition, male participants must be willing to refrain from sperm donation during this time; men who are sexually active with women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile and azoospermic men) do not require contraception\n* For Arm C: Cardiac assessment at baseline by trans- thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with LVEF 50%\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Currently receiving cancer therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or biologic therapy) or investigational anti-cancer drug\n* Any major surgery within the last 3 weeks\n* Brain metastases, leptomeningeal disease or bone metastases\n* Pregnant or lactating female\n* Unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures required in the protocol\n* Current use of anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors) at therapeutic levels\n* Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results\n* Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for patient's prior diagnosis of melanoma and locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast with local control measures (surgery, radiation)\n* Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease;

      "brief_summary": "Pheochromocytoma is a rare, catecholamine (ex. adrenaline) secreting tumor that requires preoperative alpha blockade to minimize intraoperative hemodynamic instability, thereby reducing intra- and postoperative morbidity and mortality. Phenoxybenzamine is a non-selective alpha blocker that is significantly more expensive and is associated with increased adverse effects in comparison with selective alpha blockers such as doxazosin. Retrospective studies show minimal differences in hemodynamic instability and no differences in postoperative morbidity and mortality between selective vs. non-selective alpha blockers. This study is a randomized controlled trial that will compare hemodynamic instability, morbidity, mortality, cost, and quality of life between patients blocked with phenoxybenzamine vs. doxazosin.",
      "detailed_description": "Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine (ex. adrenaline) secreting tumor for which the primary treatment is surgical resection. Due to the hormones secreted by the tumor, alpha receptors on peripheral blood vessels are activated, causing constriction of these blood vessels and dangerously high blood pressure. During resection of the tumor, the source of excess hormone secretion is abruptly removed, which can lead to life-threatening blood pressure fluctuations during surgery.\n\nAlpha blockers are a class of medication that blocks the alpha receptor on blood vessels. Given preoperatively over a few weeks, these medications negate the effects of the excess hormones secreted by the pheochromocytoma, reducing the frequency and severity of dangerous blood pressure fluctuations intraoperatively and postoperatively. Preoperative alpha blockade is therefore critical to safely perform surgery to resect pheochromocytoma.\n\nPhenoxybenzamine, a non-selective alpha blocker, is the most common medication used to alpha block patients prior to pheochromocytoma resection. However, due to increasing drug costs and increased side effects in comparison with selective alpha blockers, there is a renewed interest in studying alternatives to phenoxybenzamine.\n\nSelective alpha blockers such as doxazosin are also commonly used to alpha block patients prior to pheochromocytoma resection. Selective alpha blockers are significantly less expensive and are associated with fewer side effects than phenoxybenzamine. Most retrospective studies comparing phenoxybenzamine with selective alpha blockers show no difference in intraoperative blood pressure fluctuations, morbidity, or mortality in pheochromocytoma resection. However, no prospective, randomized controlled trials comparing phenoxybenzamine to selective alpha blockers have been performed.\n\nThe purpose of our study is to analyze preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative outcomes in patients randomized to receive phenoxybenzamine (non-selective) or doxazosin (selective) for alpha blockade prior to pheochromocytoma resection. Outcomes will include postoperative morbidity and mortality, intraoperative hemodynamic instability, quality of life, and cost.",

      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n* CD4+ cells are white blood cells that regulate the immune system by controlling the strength and quality of the immune response.\n* CD25+ cells are a subset of CD4+ cells that suppress or prevent immune responses.\n* RFT-5-dgA is an immunotoxin (substance that kills specific cells in the immune system) that kills CD25+ cells.\n* In mouse studies, RFT-5-dgA showed anti-tumor activity in animals studies.\n\nObjective: To determine whether the immune system of patients with metastatic melanoma (melanoma that has spread beyond the original site) can cause tumors to shrink if the patients are given RFT-5-dgA to remove their CD25+ cells.\n\nEligibility: Patients 18 years of age and older with metastatic melanoma whose disease has progressed after receiving standard treatment.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients receive RFT-5-dgA through a vein every other day for a total of 3 doses (one treatment course). Patients have routine blood tests during the week of treatment.\n* Four to 5 weeks after the last dose, patients are evaluated with a physical examination, blood tests and scans and x-rays to evaluate their tumor.\n* Patients whose tumor has shrunk or remained stable may be offered additional treatment with RFT-5-dgA up to a total of four courses.\n* Patients undergo leukapheresis or have several tubes of blood drawn from a vein to determine the effects of RFT-5-dgA on the immune system. This is done before the first dose of RFT-5-dgA, after the first three doses, and possibly during subsequent treatment courses in those patients who receive additional treatment. For leukapheresis, blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a catheter into a machine that separates it into its components by spinning. The white cells are extracted and the rest of the blood is returned through another needle in the other arm.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* RFT5-dgA is an immunotoxin comprised of the IL-2Ra-specific murine IgG1 antibody RFT5 linked to deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgA) via the sterically hindered heterobifunctional disulfide linker SMPT (4-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-a-methyl-a-(2-pyridyldithio)-toluene).\n* RFT5-dgA is a recombinant immunotoxin that selectively targets CD25 expressing cells in vivo. Further, treatment of human PBMC with RFT5-dgA in vitro results in the preferential depletion of CD25+ Treg cells.\n* Depletion of Treg cells can enhance tumor protection to tumor-associated antigens expressed as self antigens and the RFT5-dgA immunotoxin had potent antitumor effects in SCID mice xenografted with L540 cells which express CD25.\n* The MTD established in the phase I trial of RFT5-dgA was 15mg/m(2)/course IV.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* The primary objective is to determine whether objective clinical responses can be obtained in patients with metastatic melanoma following administration of RFT5-dgA.\n* Secondary objectives will determine whether changes occur in levels of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in peripheral blood from before to after treatment and evaluate the toxicity profile of patients treated on this trial.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients greater than 18 years of age with measurable metastatic melanoma, an expected survival greater than three months, who have progressed after receiving standard therapy will be included.\n* Standard clinical laboratory values must be normal for study inclusion and patients may not be pregnant, breast-feeding or require anticoagulation.\n* Patients must be willing to undergo leukapheresis.\n* Patients with active infections, other major medical disorders, HAMA levels greater than 1 ug/mL, or who have had prior radiotherapy or who have extensive lung disease will be excluded.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients will receive 3 mg/m(2) RFT5-dgA intravenously every other day for a total of 3 doses (one course).\n* Four to five weeks after the last dose, patients will undergo tumor evaluation, evaluation of changes in T-regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+cells and Foxp3 expression), and toxicity assessment.\n* One additional course may be administered to patients with stable disease or partial or complete response.\n* Up to 41 evaluable patients may be accrued to determine whether theRFT5-dgA can produce a modest response rate targeted to be 20 percent (p1=0.20)\n* Enrollment reflects the anticipated enrollment. Actual enrollment is unknown due to no longer having access to the data as records were destroyed",

      "brief_summary": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether bevacizumab is more effective when given together with temozolomide or paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin in killing malignant melanoma cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving temozolomide together with bevacizumab and to see how well it works compared with giving bevacizumab together with paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation and carboplatin in treating patients with stage IV malignant melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.",
      "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\n* To assess the anti-tumor activity, in terms of the percentage of patients who are treated with these regimens and who are progression-free at 6 months.\n* To assess the safety profile of each treatment regimen.\n\nSecondary\n\n* To estimate the response rate in patients treated with these regimens.\n* To estimate the distribution of progression-free survival time and overall survival time of patients treated with these regimens.\n\nTertiary\n\n* To examine the impact of therapy on angiogenesis and immune homeostasis.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status (0 vs 1) and location of metastatic disease (M1a \\[skin or subcutaneous tissue or lymph node only\\] vs M1b \\[lung\\] vs M1c \\[other visceral sites\\]) and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n* Arm I: Patients receive oral temozolomide on days 1-5 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. (closed to accrual 8/21/09)\n* Arm II: Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.\n\nIn both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients undergo blood sample collection periodically for VEGF plasma levels and analysis of changes in immune homeostasis.\n\nBeginning at study entry, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.",

      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have histological or cytological diagnosis of melanoma with progressive locally advanced or metastatic disease that is not amenable to definitive local therapy with curative intent.\n* At least one measurable tumor accessible for intratumoral injection and EP on investigator's assessment.\n* Patients may have had prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy or radiation therapy. All prior therapies must be stopped 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment, with the exception of patients who have received ipilimumab, which must be stopped 6 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment. Patients are prohibited from receiving live vaccines within 30 days prior to first dose of study treatment.\n* Age \\>= 18 years\n* Part A: Patient has agreed to two newly obtained tumor biopsies and as required re-biopsies (that can be biopsied on investigator's assessment) and to providing the acquired tissue for biomarker analysis. Analysis of one of the fresh biopsy samples for PD-1hiCD8+CTLA4hi in the CD8+CD45+ gate based on flow cytometry will be done. A second fresh biopsy sample is required for further biomarker analysis and confirmation at a later date of low PD-L1 expression using an Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay for PD-L1 expression. A valid flow cytometry result is not required for study participation, but repeated biopsy for reanalysis is strongly recommended for patient with insufficient tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in the first tissue sample. Or:\n* Part B: Anti-PD-1 non-responders are defined as those showing disease progression according to RECIST v1.1 after at least 12 weeks of therapy with a PD-1 antibody either alone or in combination with approved checkpoint inhibitor or targeted therapies according to their label. There is no serological requirement.\n* Life expectancy of at least 6 months.\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1.\n* Adequate organ function within 4 weeks of administration of study therapy:\n\n  1.

Adequate renal function:\n\n     1. Serum creatinine: ≤1.5 x ULN\n  5. Coagulation:\n\n     1. International normalized ration (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT): ≤1.5 x ULN (Only if not using anticoagulants. If patient is receiving anticoagulants, then value must be within therapeutic range for the condition that patient is being treated for).\n     2. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT): \\<=1.5 x ULN (Only if not using anticoagulants. If patient is receiving anticoagulants, then value must be within therapeutic range for the condition that patient is being treated for).\n* Female patient of childbearing potential has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 14 days prior to administration of study therapy.\n* The effects of pIL-12 EP and pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason women of child-bearing potential (not free from menses for \\>2 years, post hysterectomy/oophorectomy, or surgically sterilized) must agree to use two methods of contraception, or abstain from heterosexual activity, during participation in study, from the time of consent through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. The two methods must include at least one \"barrier method\". Barrier methods are diaphragms, cervical caps, cervical shields, male condoms, and female condoms. The second method of contraception may be another barrier method, a copper containing intrauterine device (IUD), spermicidal foams, sponges and films, or hormone-based contraception (for example, hormone pills, hormone rings, hormone patches, hormone-releasing IUDs, or Depo Provera). Men with partners who are capable of getting pregnant must agree to use one of the barrier methods of contraception listed above during participation in the study, starting with the first dose of study drug through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to understand a written informed consent document, and the willingness to sign and date it.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of administration of study therapy.\n* Patient is expected to require any other form of antineoplastic therapy while on study; including systemic chemotherapy, biological therapy, immunotherapy not specified in this protocol.\n* Patient has uveal melanoma.\n* Patient has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are clinically stable without the use of systemic steroids for at least 8 weeks prior to study entry.\n* Patient has risk factors for bowel obstruction or bowel perforation (examples include but not limited to a history of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and abdominal carcinomatosis).\n* Patient previously had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another monoclonal antibody (mAb).\n* Patient has a history of history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.\n* Patient has active infection at time of study entry that require systemic antibiotics and/or with an oral temperature of \\>= 38.3 degrees Celsius (°C)(100.9 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)) within 5 days of first treatment.\n* Patients with electronic pacemakers or defibrillators are excluded from this study, as the effect of electroporation on these devices is unknown. Patients with lower extremity lesions may be discussed with the medical monitor.\n* Patient has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Patients with vitiligo or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be exception to this rule. Patients that require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the study. Patients with hypothyroidism that is stable on hormone replacement will not be excluded from the study.\n* Patient has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or requires any other form of immunosuppressive medication. However, patients using physiologic replacement doses of hydrocortisone, or its equivalent, will be considered eligible for this study; up to 20 mg hydrocortisone (or 5 mg of prednisone) in the morning and 10 mg hydrocortisone (or 2.5 mg of prednisone) in the evening.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects upon treatment with pIL-12 EP + pembrolizumab is unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pIL-12 EP + pembrolizumab breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pIL-12 EP + pembrolizumab.\n* Patients with symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A patient who is clinically stable following treatment for these conditions is eligible.\n* Patient is Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Ab positive or HBSAg positive.",

Participants received daily oral doses of 10 mg everolimus or matching placebo as study drug. In both arms, the study drug was combined with best supportive care and treatment cycles were defined as 28 days. Participants were treated until disease progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0, intolerable toxicity, death, lost to follow-up or consent withdrawal. Regardless of the reason for study drug discontinuation, participants had a safety follow-up visit scheduled 30 days after the last dose of the study drug.\n\nPer data monitoring committee recommendation, all participants on treatment with placebo were allowed to crossover to open-label treatment with everolimus. This change was implemented through protocol amendment 3 (issued on 06-May-2016) after which remaining participants entered into open-label phase of the study.",

ABI-007 is a new preparation of the active drug paclitaxel. It contains the same medication as the prescription chemotherapy drug Abraxane®. Abraxane® is approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. Dacarbazine is approved by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma. In this study, ABI-007 and Dacarbazine will be tested as therapy for people who have not yet had any cancer treatment for the diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.",

      "condition": "Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Carcinoma; Large Cell Lung Carcinoma; Neuroendocrine Carcinoma; Small Cell Carcinoma; Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer AJCC v7",
      "intervention": "Cisplatin; Etoposide; Veliparib; Placebo",
      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together with or without cisplatin and etoposide and to see how well they work in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer or large cell neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Veliparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving cisplatin and etoposide with or without veliparib may work better in treating patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer or metastatic large cell neuroendocrine non-small cell lung cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of veliparib to use in combination with cisplatin and etoposide (CE). (Phase I) II. To determine whether the addition of ABT-888 (veliparib) to cisplatin etoposide (CE) results in improved progression free survival (PFS) over CE with placebo in the frontline therapy of newly diagnosed extensive stage small cell lung cancer. (Phase II)\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the overall survival (OS) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888. (Phase II) II. To assess the overall response rate (ORR) as well as complete response rate (CRR) associated with the combination of CE plus ABT-888. (Phase II) III. To determine the toxicity profile of the combination of ABT-888 and CE chemotherapy in this patient population. (Phase II)\n\nOTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To conduct exploratory correlative analysis of the impact of the select biomarkers. (Phase II) II. To compare the overall toxicity profile and specifically the incidence and severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with the addition of ABT-888 to CE. (Phase II)\n\nOUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of veliparib followed by a phase II study.\n\nPhase I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, etoposide intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPhase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM D: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM E: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-7, etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3, and cisplatin IV over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.",

      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n* Natural killer (NK) cells are large lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) that are important in the immune response to cancer.\n* IL-2 (Aldesleukin) is a substance the body makes that controls the growth and function of many types of cells. The Food and Drug Administration has approved IL-3 for treating metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer. (Metastatic disease is cancer that has spread beyond the primary site.)\n\nObjectives: To determine the safety and effectiveness of treating metastatic melanoma and kidney cancer with laboratory-treated NK cells and IL-2.\n\nEligibility: Patients 18 years of age or older with metastatic melanoma or kidney cancer who have previously been treated with high-dose IL-2.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Leukapheresis. Patients under leukapheresis to obtain NK cells for the treatment regimen. Blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and directed through a cell separator machine where white blood cells are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned to the patient through a needle in the other arm. NK cells are removed from the white blood cells and treated for re-infusion into the patient.\n* Chemotherapy. Starting 8 days before infusion of the treated NK cells, patients receive intravenous (IV, through a vein) infusions of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine to suppress the immune system.\n* NK cell infusion. Patients receive a 30-minute IV infusion of NK cells 2 days after the last dose of chemotherapy.\n* IL-2 therapy. Within 24 hours of the NK cell infusion, patients receive high-dose IL-2 as a 15-minute IV infusion every 8 hours for up to 5 days. A second cycle of IL-2 is given about 14 days after the first.\n* Blood tests and biopsy. Patients have frequent blood tests during the treatment period and may be asked to undergo a biopsy (surgical removal of a small piece of tumor or lymph node) at the end of treatment to look at the effects of the treatment on the tumor immune cells.\n* Follow-up evaluation. Patients are evaluated 4-6 weeks after completing treatment. They have a physical examination, scans of tumor sites, blood tests and blood sampling (or leukapheresis) to examine the response to treatment. Patients who improve with treatment return for evaluations every month. Those whose tumor grows again after originally shrinking may receive one additional treatment course.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Natural killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes that are critical effector cells in the early innate immune response to pathogens and cancer.\n* Previous and current clinical investigations have clearly demonstrated that T lymphocytes can mediate the regression of metastatic melanoma. However, not all patients with cancer are eligible for this type of immunotherapy either because resectable tumor is not available, the TIL do not expand sufficiently, or the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) that do proliferate do not exhibit sufficient tumor specific reactivity.\n* We have recently developed techniques for the in vitro isolation and expansion of anti-tumor NK cells to levels suitable for the treatment of cancer patients and are proposing in this protocol to evaluate therapy using these NK cells.\n* In Surgery Branch pre-clinical experiments, we evaluated lysis of fresh melanoma cell digests, melanoma cell lines, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) lines, and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by NK cells from several patients and demonstrated that NK cells could lyse some fresh melanoma digests, as well as melanoma cell lines and renal cell cancer (RCC) lines, while sparing normal allogeneic and autologous PBMCs.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Determine the ability of the administration of autologous natural killer (NK) cells plus aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen to mediate tumor regression in patients with metastatic melanoma or kidney cancer.\n* Determine the rate of repopulation of the natural killer cells in treated patients.\n* Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients, 18 years of age or older with metastatic melanoma or metastatic kidney cancer who have previously received high dose IL-2, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) of 0 or 1.\n* Patients may not have any active systemic infections, coagulations disorders, major medical illnesses of the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune systems or any form of autoimmune disease or immunodeficiency.\n\nPatients must be eligible to receive high-dose IL-2.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients will undergo apheresis on 03-C-0277 (Cell Harvest and Preparation for Surgery Branch Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols) to obtain cells for generation of autologous natural killer cells.\n* All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day IV) on days -8 and -7 and fludarabine (25 mg/m\\^2/day IV) on days -6 through -2.\n* On day 0 patients will receive the infusion of autologous natural killer lymphocytes and then begin the first cycle of high-dose IL-2 (720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hours for up to 15 doses). A second cycle of IL-2 will be administered approximately 14 days later.\n* Clinical and Immunologic response will be evaluated about 4 to 6 weeks\n\nafter the second cycle of IL-2.\n\n-Using a small optimal Phase II design, two cohorts of patients, initially 16 in each cohort, will be enrolled, and if at least one of the first 16 patients has a clinical response (partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)), accrual will continue to 29 patients, targeting a 15% goal for objective response.",

In this clinical trial combination the standard immunotherapeutic treatment; the programmed death 1 (PD-1) regulatory antibody Nivolumab and a peptide vaccine consisting of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) peptides will be tested in patients with metastatic melanoma. Patients will be treated with Nivolumab every second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine is given from start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6 vaccines and thereafter every fourth week up to 1 year.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nHuge advances have been made in the treatment of metastatic melanoma (MM) the past 5 years. Especially immunotherapy has shown promising results.\n\nCancer cells are naturally attacked by cells of the immune system, but can induce a state of tolerance whereby they escape from immune attack. This escape is brought about by many mechanisms. An important one is the programmed death pathway (PD-1/PD-L1). PD-L1 is commonly overexpressed on cancer cells. Interaction of PD-1 on activated T cells and PD-L1 on cancer cells lead to inhibition of the cytotoxic T cells. Another important mechanism is through overexpression of the metabolic enzyme IDO on cancer cells. Activation of IDO also inhibits cytotoxic T cells.\n\nInvestigators have recently identified spontaneous T cell reactivity against PD-L1 and IDO in the tumor microenvironment and in the peripheral blood of patients with MM and healthy donors. Both IDO and PD-L1 reactive CD8 T cells are cytotoxic and can kill cancer cells and immune regulatory cells in vitro.. Thus boosting specific T cells that recognize immune regulatory proteins such as IDO and PD-L1 may directly modulate immune regulation.\n\nDue to distinct mechanisms of action, the combination of treatment with a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1 (Nivolumab) and a vaccine with peptides against PD-L1 and IDO may have a synergistic effect.\n\nInvestigators have previously reported a phase I trial where, the IDO peptide was tested in 15 patients with MM in combination with Ipilimumab, and no grade 3-4 toxicity was seen. The PD-L1 peptide is currently being tested in a first-in-man study in patients with multiple myeloma.\n\nMethods:\n\nA two-step clinical phase I/II trial design will be used, starting out with a pilot study including 6 patients with MM to test feasibility and tolerability. If the treatment is found feasible the study will be extended to a phase II study with 24 patients. The objective is to describe anti-tumor immune responses and objective responses using RECIST 1.1.\n\nPatients will be treated with Nivolumab in accordance with standard regimen, which involves outpatient IV infusions every second week as long as there is clinical benefit. The PD-L1/IDO peptide vaccine is given from start of Nivolumab and every second week for the first 6 vaccines and thereafter every fourth week up to 1 year. 15 vaccines will be administered in total.\n\nPatients will be followed with clinical controls and diagnostic imaging every 12 weeks. Patients who receive all vaccines will have follow up after 3 and 6 months in parallel with standard of care treatment for Nivolumab.",

All the patients had undergone completion lymphadenectomy with no clinical or radiographic evidence of residual regional node disease within 12 weeks before randomization, had recovered from definitive surgery, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. BRAF V600 mutation status was confirmed in primary-tumor or lymph-node tissue by a central reference laboratory. All the patients provided written informed consent.\n\nThe primary end point was recurrence-free survival, Overall survival, as the key secondary end point, was to be tested in a hierarchical manner only if the primary end point met the criteria for significance. The overall survival analysis used a preplanned three-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design with an O'Brien-Fleming-type boundary, which was used to determine the significance threshold for the first interim overall survival analysis (two-sided P=0.000019).\n\nDisease assessments included clinical examination and imaging by means of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or both.) Imaging was performed every 3 months during the first 24 months, then every 6 months until disease recurrence or the completion of the trial. Follow-up for survival began after recurrence and continued through the end of the trial. Adverse events and laboratory values were assessed at screening, on the date of randomization, at least once per month through month 12, and at every visit for disease-recurrence assessment after month 12. Adverse events and laboratory values were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Key Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Completely resected histologically confirmed high-risk \\[Stage IIIa (LN metastasis more than 1 mm), IIIb or IIIc cutaneous melanoma determined to be V600E/K mutation positive by a central laboratory.

      "intervention": "Leuprolide; GP100: 209-217(210M) Peptide; MAGE-3 Peptide",
      "brief_summary": "The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the drug leuprolide will increase the level of immune cells in your body. Researchers will also want to know if this drug given together with melanoma vaccines (gp100 and MAGE-3) can improve the ability of tumor fighting immune cells (T cells) to fight melanoma cells.\n\nPrimary Objective:\n\n1. To compare the tumor-specific immune responses to melanoma-specific peptide vaccines, gp100 and MAGE-3 in the presence or absence of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist-Leuprolide, in patients with stage IIb and III melanoma, uveal melanoma or stage IV melanoma that the metastatic lesion(s) has been surgically removed.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. To evaluate the kinetics of enhanced thymic activity measured by TREC analysis and flow cytometric analysis following sex hormone ablation by Leuprolide in melanoma patients.\n2. To assess whether there are significant differences in overall quality of life (QOL) between patients receiving Leuprolide to those not receiving leuprolide.",
      "detailed_description": "This study uses vaccines named gp100 or MAGE-3 to immunize patients with melanoma. The type of melanoma they will be used for contains a protein that is also found in the vaccines. These vaccines are designed to stimulate immune cells, also called T cells, to recognize and kill melanoma cells. Leuprolide will be studied to determine whether it will (is designed to) improve your response to the vaccine.\n\nIf you are eligible for this treatment, you will be assigned to one of the two groups that either receive one vaccine or two different vaccines, depending on your tissue type (either gp100 vaccine alone or gp100 and MAGE-3 vaccines). A small amount of the vaccine(s) will be injected under your skin to test your body's immune response to the vaccines. The size of the skin reaction will be measured at 48-72 hours. This skin test will be done before you receive any vaccine, at 6 months, and at 12 months, if possible.The participant and/or participant's family will be given detailed verbal and written instructions on how to measure any reaction to the skin tests. A data sheet and ruler (cm/mm) will be given to the participant.\n\nYou will then be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of 2 treatment groups. Participants in one group will receive leuprolide with the vaccine(s). Participants in the other group will not receive leuprolide. Which group you are assigned to will depend partially on your age.\n\nIf you are assigned to receive leuprolide injection, you will also have a bone mineral density test to check on the strength of your bones.\n\nBefore the treatment starts, you will be asked to answer a questionnaire about your quality of life and sexual functioning. Then at 3 months and 12 months of treatment, you will be asked again to answer the same questionnaire. It should take about 20 minutes each time to finish the questionnaire.\n\nThe vaccines will be injected in the skin every 3 weeks for a total of 48 weeks. Those patients in Group I will receive 32 injections of peptide, whereas those patients in Group II will receive 64 injections of peptide over a 48 week period. If you are assigned to receive leuprolide, then leuprolide will be injected in the muscle at the beginning of the study and at 12 weeks, for a total of 2 additional injections. Both the vaccine and leuprolide injections will be given each time at the melanoma outpatient clinic at M. D. Anderson.\n\nBlood (about 4 teaspoons) will be taken at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, then every 12 weeks up to 48 weeks, or at any time if your tumor starts to grow back. Researchers will use this blood to find out how well your immune cells are working to fight your tumor cells.\n\nAt around 24 weeks and 48 weeks into treatment, your will have CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to check on the status of your disease. At around 24 weeks, if you are receiving leuprolide and had an abnormal bone mineral density test before the treatment, you will also have the second bone mineral density test to check on the strength of your bones.\n\nYou may be taken off study if your disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. If you are taken off study, you will be asked to have repeat scans and a physical exam, including blood (about 4 tablespoons) for routine tests.\n\nFollowing the first 48 week treatment period, you will be evaluated every 3 months for one year, every 4 months for one year, every 6 months for one year, and then once a year from then on if clinically feasible.\n\nYou will have an MRI/CT of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis to check on the status of your disease. If your disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur, you will be taken off study.\n\nBlood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine lab tests. An additional 4 tablespoons of blood will be drawn at each follow-up visit to determine how long the t-cell counts remain high.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Gp100 and MAGE-3 vaccines are experimental and authorized for research use only. Leuprolide is approved in treating prostate cancer patients and other gynecological diseases, but is not approved for treatment of melanoma. Up to 100 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.",

Assess disease-free survival (DFS) with sequential dacarbazine and interferon-alfa-2b as an adjuvant to primary therapy for patients with uveal melanoma with genetic imbalance.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Evaluate side effects and assess safety in the patient population.\n\nII. Examine the relationship between the levels of plasma biomarkers of immune function and tumor invasion and the clinical outcome.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients receive dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 29. Beginning 4 weeks after the second dose of dacarbazine, patients receive recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously 3 times a week for 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months.",

      "brief_summary": "The majority of melanoma vaccines tested to date have been antigen-specific vaccines targeting melanoma-specific or associated antigens and utilizing a variety of delivery systems and immune-adjuvants. As opposed to testing an \"off the shelf\" vaccine that might be able to treat a subset of patients, our approach has been personalized to the patient and applicable to all patients. Our vaccine approach consists of harnessing the most potent antigen presenting cell in the body - the dendritic cell (DC) - together with the full repertoire of tumor antigens from an individual's cancer. We have conducted phase I and II studies using an autologous DC-tumor cell fusion technique that has now been simplified into a DC-tumor cell lysate vaccine. The autologous tumor lysate (TL) is loaded into yeast cell wall particles (YCWP) that are naturally and efficiently taken up into the patient's DC. These autologous tumor lysate, particle-loaded, DC (TLPLDC) are injected intradermally (ID) monthly x 3 followed by boosters at 6, 12, and 18 months.",
      "detailed_description": "Stage III and Stage IV (resected) melanoma patients will be identified prior to definitive surgery and screened for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Eligible patients will be counseled and consented for tissue procurement. Enrolled patients will have their disease surgically resected and a portion 1mg minimum of their melanoma sterilely frozen in provided freezing vials and storage tubes. This tissue will be shipped in liquid nitrogen shippers through FedEx to our central facility in Greenville SC and stored frozen until vaccine preparation. If patients cannot be rendered disease-free, they will be considered screen failures for this study. If melanoma is being resected from multiple locations primary and nodes two different metastatic sites then samples of each would be preferred but not mandatory.\n\nAs indicated by SoC per the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and determined by the treating team, if a patient is to receive systemic therapy (chemotherapy or IFN-aguidelines) and determined by the treating team, if a patient is to receive systemic therapy (chemotherapy or IFN-central facility in Greenville, SC) and stored frozen until vaccine preparation. If patients cannot be rendered disease-free, they will receive a single injection of Neupogen (G-CSF) 300 mod (or its equivalent) SQ 24-48 hrs. prior to having 70 mL of blood collected and sent to our central facility for DC isolation and preparation. Patients who cannot tolerate Neupogen, or its equivalent or refuse it, will have 120 mL of blood drawn and sent. Additional blood may be drawn if additional vaccine doses need to be made or re-made for any reason. Vaccines will be prepared by producing TL through freeze/thaw cycling and then loaded into pre-prepared YCWP. The TL-loaded YCWP will be introduced to the DC for phagocytosis thus creating the TLPLDC vaccine which will be frozen in single dose vials. Each vial will contain 1-1.5 x 106 TLPLDC and will be labeled with the patient's unique study number.\n\nBased on their randomization, autologous TLPLDC (active vaccine) or unloaded YCWP + autologous DC (control) will be sent back to the site in a blinded fashion. Regardless of assigned group, the site will receive 6 single dose vials to be injected intradermal monthly x 3 followed by boosters at 6, 12, and 18 months in the same lymph node draining area (preferably the anterior thigh). Patients must begin vaccinations between 3 weeks and 3 months from completion of (SoC). Frozen tumor will be maintained for active vaccines for all patients to include the control patients. The latter will be offered their active vaccine at time of recurrence in a crossover fashion. Additionally, control patients who do not recur will be offered active vaccine at the completion of the trial.\n\nSafety data will be collected on local and systemic toxicities and graded and reported per the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03.\n\nDisease-free status will be monitored per SoC as outlined by NCCN. Suspected recurrences will be documented with biopsy and pathologic confirmation. Time to recurrence will be based on date of randomization to time of confirmed recurrence.\n\nRecurrent patients will be offered participation in the open label portion of the study. New active vaccine will be made for all patients, and they will be inoculated at 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 9 mos. Patients will be treated per SoC for their recurrence. Safety and tumor response will be assessed per RECIST and irRC on their SoC follow-up scans.\n\nBlood (50 mL) will be collected from all patients prior to each inoculation and at 24 months from enrollment for a total of 7 time points or a total of 350 mL of blood over 2 years. The collected blood will be sent to our central facility for immunologic testing of the T-cell response.",

Qualified participants were re-randomized to receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg in a double-blind fashion. Participants who qualified to switch to pembrolizumab must have completed a washout period of ≥28 days from last dose of chemotherapy before receiving pembrolizumab.

Treatment repeats every 90 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPatients undergo blood collection periodically during study for correlative pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacogenetic, and pharmacogenomic analyses. Blood specimens are obtained for PK measurement at baseline and periodically during study treatment for analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Blood specimens are also evaluated by pharmacogenetic assessment of polymorphisms in CTLA4. Patients also undergo leukapheresis at baseline and at least once between days 30-60 for biomarker analysis of immune cell activation (i.e.,biomarkers CD45RO, CD45RA, HLA-DR, CCR5, CCR7, CD62L, CD69); Treg phenotype (i.e., CD4/CD25/GITR/intracellular FoxP3); and Treg function. In HLA-A2.1 positive patients, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are analyzed for antigen-specific immune reactivity by MART-1, gp100, and tyrosine MHC tetramer using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay. Plasma obtained during leukapheresis is assessed for levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines. Some plasma is stored for future proteomic profile analysis.\n\nPatients also undergo excisional or punch biopsy at baseline and between days 30-60 during course 1. Tumor tissue samples embedded in paraffin are analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining for several biomarkers, including biomarkers of immune cell response (i.e., cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) and biomarkers of melanoma (i.e., S-100, MART-1, and/or HMB45). Frozen tumor tissue samples are analyzed by gene chips and gene arrays for gene expression profile and by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for FoxP3.

      "brief_summary": "People who have neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) can have tumors that grow on the auditory nerves and cause hearing loss. These tumors are called vestibular schwannomas (VSs), or acoustic neuromas. People with NF2 can also get schwannomas in other parts of their body, as well as tumors called meningiomas and ependymomas. Because VSs can cause hearing loss, many people with NF2 will have treatment to preserve their hearing. This treatment usually involves surgery. Because surgery has risks and is not able to help everyone with VSs, other methods of treatment are being explored. One area of exploration is looking to see if there is a drug that can be taken that might prevent the VSs from growing larger and causing hearing loss or brainstem compression. This study is exploring whether a drug that is approved by the FDA and is currently used to treat other tumors might also work to treat VSs. Based on people who have taken this drug to treat VSs already, there is some reason to think that it might be helpful to certain people with NF2. People enrolled in this study will receive the drug one time every three weeks for one year by infusion. This study will follow subjects over the course of the year that the person is taking the drug and for six months after the drug is stopped. This study is recruiting people who have NF2 and are currently having symptoms of tinnitus, dizziness, and/or hearing loss from their VSs. If you have NF2 and are currently having symptoms caused by your VSs, you may be eligible to participate.",

      "title": "AMG 479 in Advanced Carcinoid and Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "phase": "PHASE2",
      "condition": "Neuroendocrine Tumor; Carcinoid Tumor; Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor",
      "intervention": "AMG 479",
      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of AMG 479 against carcinoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. AMG 479 is an antibody that is made in the laboratory. Antibodies are highly specific proteins produced by the body's immune system that recognize foreign substances in the body. AMG 479 has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that AMG 479 may help to prevent the growth of some neuroendocrine tumors. The observed antitumor activity of AMG 479, together with the current limited treatment options available for patients with neuroendocrine tumors, warrant further investigation of AMG 479 in this patient population.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of neoplasms. NETs are commonly subclassified into two broad subgroups according to their site of origin: pancreatic NETs are thought to arise from the endocrine cells of the pancreas, whereas NETs of other sites such as the lungs or gastrointestinal tract are often referred to as carcinoid tumors. While histologically similar, carcinoid tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have demonstrated different response rates in prior phase II studies of antitumor agents. Because of these differences, we will perform the current study using two cohorts of patients (30 with carcinoid and 30 with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors). The statistical design, however, is the same for both cohorts. With 30 patients in each cohort, this study has 80% power assuming type I error of 6% to differentiate a \\>/=17% objective response rate from a \\</=5% objective response rate using a single stage design. The proposed regimen would be promising in either cohort if at least 4 of 30 patients achieve an objective response.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Locally unresectable or metastatic carcinoid or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. To be classified as having a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, patients must have clinical evidence of currently having or having had a primary pancreatic neuroendocrine lesion.\n* Measurable disease by RECIST criteria\n* Evidence of progressive disease (by RECIST) within 12 months of study entry.\n* Tumors must be considered well- or moderately-differentiated. Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of small cell carcinoma are excluded from this study.\n* Adequate hepatic, renal, bone marrow and glycemic function as outlined in the protocol\n* Prior treatment with chemotherapy, hepatic artery embolization, surgery or other therapeutic agents is allowed.\n* Prior or concurrent therapy with somatostatin analogs is permitted: however patients must continue on a stable dose of somatostatin analogs while receiving study treatment.\n* 18 years of age or older\n* ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2 \\[Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group \\]\n* Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks\n* Negative pregnancy test\n* Ability to sign informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Poorly differentiated or small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas\n* Insulin secreting pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (insulinomas)\n* Clinically apparent central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Myocardial infraction in the past 6 months\n* Major surgery 4 weeks prior to enrollment\n* Uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric illness\n* Pregnant or lactating women. Both men and women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of using effective birth control measures during the course of the study.\n* Prior antitumor therapy within 4 weeks of enrollment (with the exception of somatostatin analogs).\n* Recent infection requiring systemic anti-infective treatment that was completed 14 days or less prior to enrollment (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection or upper respiratory tract infection).\n* Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, chronic or active hepatitis B\n* Prior IGF or IGF receptor inhibitor therapy \\[insulin like growth factor \\]",
