11. A Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of NKTR-214 in Combination With Nivolumab and Other Anti-Cancer Therapies in Patients With Select Advanced Solid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT02983045
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The inclusion criteria specify 'locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors,' which encompasses the patient's metastatic neuroendocrine tumor of the small intestine. While specific NET inclusion criteria are mentioned as potentially applying, the broad initial criteria are met. The patient's history of somatostatin analogs and surgery doesn't explicitly exclude them, assuming sufficient washout period from prior chemotherapy/biological therapy (which is unspecified in the patient data). The combination of NKTR-214 and nivolumab represents a potentially useful immunotherapy approach for progressive NET, and the study has published results in peer-reviewed journals, indicating good scientific quality.
