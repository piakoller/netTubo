1. Study Escalating Doses of PM01183 in Combination With Fixed Doxorubicin in Patients With Specific Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01970540
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study is clinically relevant for the patient. The inclusion criteria explicitly list 'Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors' which directly matches the patient's diagnosis of a pancreatic NET. The patient's age is likely within the 18-75 range, and assuming a reasonable ECOG PS (≤1), they would likely meet the inclusion criteria. The combination of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin could be a potential treatment option to consider alongside somatuline or PRRT, especially given the progression of the disease with liver and lymph node metastases. The study is completed, has published results, and therefore meets the quality criteria.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Endometrial Adenocarcinomas; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Small-cell Lung Cancer With Less Than 2 Prior Cytotoxic-containing Lines of Therapy
   Intervention: lurbinectedin (PM01183); Doxorubicin

2. A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas
   NCT ID: NCT02875223
   Status: TERMINATED
   Phase: PHASE1
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes grade 2 NETs, which matches the patient’s diagnosis of a G2 NET of the pancreas. The inclusion criteria of advanced/unresectable tumors aligns with the patient’s metastatic disease. While the patient’s ECOG and age are unknown, the study requires ECOG 0-1, which is a reasonable assumption. The intervention, CC-90011, represents a novel therapy that could be considered for relapsed/refractory disease, addressing the clinical question of alternative therapies to somatuline or PRRT. Finally, the study has published results in peer-reviewed journals, indicating good scientific quality.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Neoplasms
   Intervention: CC-90011; Rifampicin; Itraconazole
   Sponsor: Celgene
   Start Date: 2016-08-31
   Completion Date: 2024-03-25
   Locations: Local Institution - 101, Dijon, France; Local Institution - 102, Marseille Cedex 9, France; Local Institution - 100, Villejuif Cedex, France
   URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02875223
   Summary: Study CC-90011-ST-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation and expansion, First-In-Human (FIH) clinical study of CC-90011 in subjects with advanced unresectable solid tumors (enriched for grade 2 NENs, grade 2 NETs and NECs) and R/R NHL (MZL, including extranodal MZL \[EMZL\], splenic MZL \[SM...

3. A Study Of The Efficacy And Safety Of Sunitinib In Patients With Advanced Well-Differentiated Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT01525550
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE4
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study specifically focuses on well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which matches the patient’s G2 NET diagnosis. While the patient’s prior therapies and ECOG status are unknown, the exclusion criteria regarding prior tyrosine kinase inhibitors or mTOR inhibitors don't immediately rule the patient out, and the disease progression criteria could apply given the 2015 diagnosis and current need for further therapy. Sunitinib is a potentially useful treatment option to consider alongside somatuline or PRRT. The study is completed, has published results, and a publication exists, indicating good scientific quality.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Well-differentiated Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor
   Intervention: sunitinib
   Sponsor: Pfizer
   Start Date: 2012-06-06
   Completion Date: 2018-07-26
   Locations: Univeristy of California, Orange, United States; Columbia University Medical Center, New York, United States; Barwon Health - University Hospital Geelong, Geelong, Australia
   URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01525550
   Summary: The purpose of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of sunitinib in subjects with unresectable pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

4. Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors
   NCT ID: NCT03034200
   Status: COMPLETED
   Phase: PHASE2
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The study explicitly includes patients with neuroendocrine tumors, and the patient has a pancreatic NET with metastases. The inclusion criteria do not immediately rule the patient out – there’s no age limit specified that would exclude them, prior therapies are allowed, and the requirement for detectable lesions is met. While ECOG/Karnofsky is not specified for the patient, the study requires a performance status ≥60%, which is reasonable to assume the patient might meet. ONC201 represents a potentially useful alternative treatment option to somatuline or PRRT, and the study has published results in peer-reviewed journals, indicating good scientific quality.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Recurrent Neuroendocrine Tumor; Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumor
   Intervention: ONC201
   Sponsor: Peter Anderson
   Start Date: 2017-08-02
   Completion Date: 2023-05-19
   Locations: Cleveland Clinic Pediatric and Taussig Cancer Institute, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, United States
   URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03034200
   Summary: The purpose of this study is to learn if a new drug, ONC201 can make tumors become smaller or go away completely. Investigators also want to learn if ONC201 can prevent new deposits of cancer from appearing in new places in participants (metastases). A phase 2 study of ONC201 in PC-PG (pheochromocyt...

5. Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET
   NCT ID: NCT03972488
   Status: ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING
   Phase: PHASE3
   Clinically Relevant: YES (Score: 1.0)
   Clinical Reasoning:
   This study appears clinically relevant for the patient. The patient has a G2 pancreatic NET with liver metastases, which falls within the GEP-NET inclusion criteria of the study. While the patient's ECOG and age are unknown, the study requires a KPS ≥ 60 (equivalent to ECOG 0-1) and includes patients ≥ 15 years old, so these are not immediately disqualifying. The patient’s DOTATOC PET scan indicates somatostatin receptor expression, fulfilling a key inclusion criterion. The study investigates Lutathera, a PRRT therapy, which directly addresses the clinical question of whether to pursue Somatuline or PRRT. The study is a Phase 3 trial with published results, indicating good scientific quality.
   Has Posted Results: YES (verified)
   Condition: Gastro-enteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor
   Intervention: Lutathera; 30 mg Octreotide long acting repeatable (LAR) (Sandostatin LAR Depot); 2.5% Lys-Arg sterile amino acid solution; High dose 60 mg octreotide long-acting repeatable
   Sponsor: Advanced Accelerator Applications
   Start Date: 2020-01-08
   Completion Date: 2027-10-29
   Locations: Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, United States; USF - H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, United States; University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics - Oncology, Iowa City, United States
   URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03972488
   Summary: The aim of NETTER-2 was to determine if Lutathera in combination with long-acting octreotide prolongs progression free survival (PFS) in gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) patients with high proliferation rate tumors (G2 and G3), when given as a first line treatment compared to tr...
