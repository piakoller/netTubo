      "brief_summary": "Background Treatment and control of cancer is associated with high costs, to patients in the form of side effects and discomfort during investigations, to society in the form of expensive drugs and studies.\n\nCirculating tumor cells (CTC) has received great attention as a cancer biomarker in trying to estimate future course in patients with breast cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer. CTC is believed to be a crucial step in cancer spreading to the bloodstream and giving rise to metastases. Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) specifically adds specificity to the analysis of the CTC.\n\nThe investigators would like to with molecular biological methods predict which patients requires special monitoring and individualized therapy and explore these tests as clinical decision support.\n\nPurpose and method\n\nIn a blood sample from patients with neuro-endocrine tumor (NET) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the investigators will by cell separation, flow cytometry and DNA sequencing and digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR):\n\n1. Identify and isolate the CTC and investigate these for tumor-specific mutations.\n2. Quantify ctDNA and analyze this for specific mutations, which in the past has been found frequent in NET and HCC.\n3. Compare findings of mutations on CTC and ctDNA with mutations in tissue biopsies.\n\nThe results are compared with the clinical data on disease course, including the effect of treatment and survival.\n\nSubjects 40 Patients with small intestinal/unknown primary NET before treatment with somatostatin analogues 30 patients with pancreatic NET before treatment with Everolimus 30 patients with presumed radically treated HCC 30 patients with HCC in treatment with Sorafenib A blood sample will be taken prior to the start of treatment, after 1 month after start of treatment and thereafter every 3.-6. month for up to two years.\n\nPerspectives In several cancer types molecular diagnostics have had significant influence in treatment and control strategy. The goal is in future to be able to take advantage of a so-called \"liquid biopsy\" as clinical decision support. The study will bring new knowledge to this growing field of research.",

Following the amendment 6, up to a maximum of 50 additional patients may be included in the Sarcoma (cohort 1), Rare ovarian cancer (cohort 2) or Primary central nervous system lymphoma (cohort 3) cohorts, within the limit of 350 patients to be included in total.\n\nThe study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.\n\nAll participants who reach the maximum treatment duration per protocol and stop the pembrolizumab with a clinical benefit (prolonged stable disease, partial or complete response), may be eligible for up to an additional 1 year (approximately 17 cycles) of pembrolizumab treatment if they progress during the follow-up period. This retreatment is termed the Second course or Re-challenge.\n\nThe second pembrolizumab course will continue until 12 months of retreatment, progression or until the end of the study, whichever occurs first.",

      "detailed_description": "Biomarker-based tools that can accurately predict gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) treatment response and tumor recurrence are currently not available. Circulating biomarkers that are associated with GEP-NETs are limited to measurements of plasma chromogranin A (CgA). The investigators have developed a PCR-based tool to quantitate (score) the circulating GEP-NET molecular signature (\"liquid\" biopsy) with high sensitivity and specificity. This signature can identify all types of GEP-NETs including small (1cm) non-metastatic tumors, is significantly reduced after tumor debulking and is decreased following surgical \"cure\". Elevated post-surgical scores are associated with tumor recurrence within 6 months in \\~40% of cases. Current NET treatment protocols are associated with tumor recurrence (progression free survival) ranging from 5-18 months. The majority of patients will experience a relapse within 18 months irrespective of the treatment approach. The investigators hypothesize that a PCR measurement of circulating NET mRNA can accurately predict the extent of surgical resection (tumor removal) and elevated scores can predict tumor relapse before this occurs. This biomarker protocol seeks to test this hypothesis and evaluate whether changes in plasma CgA are as effective in predicting resection and recurrence.",

      "brief_summary": "The ANTARES study is a phase II basket trial designed to evaluate the tissue-agnostic efficacy of the monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with advanced or metastatic rare tumors.\n\nThe study aims to treat rare malignancies with PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥ 10), regardless of the tumor's tissue type or location. Patients who have not responded to standard treatments will be included, and treatment will last for up to 12 months. The study will assess objective response, progression-free survival, and biomarkers such as PD-L1, ctDNA, and microvesicles, in a multicenter collaborative effort to provide innovative therapeutic options for this underrepresented population",
      "detailed_description": "The ANTARES study is a phase II \"basket\" trial designed to evaluate the tissue-agnostic efficacy of the monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with advanced or metastatic rare tumors. A \"basket\" trial is an innovative type of clinical trial where patients with different types of cancers, but sharing a common molecular feature (in this case, PD-L1 expression), are treated with the same therapy, regardless of the tumor's site of origin. This approach allows for the evaluation of treatments targeting specific molecular characteristics, independent of the primary cancer type.\n\nRare tumors, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), have an incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people per year. Although each rare cancer type is individually uncommon, collectively they account for 25-30% of all malignancies and are often underrepresented in clinical trials due to recruitment challenges and limited funding. As a result, patients with rare cancers generally have a poorer prognosis compared to those with more common tumors.\n\nIn this study, patients with advanced or refractory rare malignancies expressing PD-L1, with a combined positive score (CPS) of ≥10, will be treated with nivolumab. Treatment will be administered until disease progression or for a maximum duration of 12 months, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of this tissue-agnostic immunotherapy approach. Efficacy will be measured according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, with objective response as the primary endpoint. Additionally, the study will assess response biomarkers, including PD-L1, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and microvesicles, to better understand the correlation between biomarker expression and clinical outcomes.\n\nThis multicenter trial, with an estimated duration of four years, will be conducted at Institute of Cancer of the State of São Paulo (ICESP) and other partner institutions. The study aims to overcome existing barriers in rare cancer treatment by offering an innovative approach that explores the potential of personalized therapies based on molecular characteristics, rather than the tumor's primary site",

      "brief_summary": "The three tumour streams that will be studied in this protocol are: (i) upper GI malignancies (comprising intra-hepatic/extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal cancers).); (ii) neuroendocrine tumours (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and (iii) rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours).\n\nThe role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.\n\nThis protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of nivolumab \\& ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 2 clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with rare cancers. This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab. If the safety profile is acceptable and clinically efficacy is seen, this study would support the use of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with these cancers.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, they are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. The rare care project has defined a rare malignancy as a cancer with an incidence of less than 6/100000/year. It is estimated that 42,000 people are diagnosed with a form of rare or less common cancer in Australia every year (www.canceraustralia.gov.au). The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of these patients. Given the recent success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a whole range of different cancer types, it can be postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. It is proposed here that patient cohorts which fall within three distinct tumour streams will be examined, with all patients receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy. The three tumour streams are defined as: upper GI malignancies (comprising intra-hepatic/ extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal cancers).); neuroendocrine tumours (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours). Although overall response rates for individual tumour types will not be established due to sample size (target 20 patients per tumour stream, n=60 total), descriptive information of individual patient responses will guide immune-directed therapies to responsive rare tumour types and may be broadened to tumour streams.",

      "detailed_description": "When patients are suspected of having neuroendocrine tumours, they will usually undergo various imaging scans such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and octreotide scintigraphy (octreoscan) to try to identify the primary tumour. During the patients' course of disease, they will continue to have various CT, MRI, and/or octreoscans. Sometimes, despite using scans, laboratory tests, and examination, it is still difficult to properly diagnose neuroendocrine tumours.\n\nDoctors have found that most neuroendocrine tumours make too much of a hormone called somatostatin on their cell surface. Because of this doctors have been using positron emission tomography (PET) scans using a special contrast dye called 68Ga-DOTATATE in hopes of better diagnosing and managing neuroendocrine tumours. 68Ga-DOTATATE can label the cells that have somatostatin (such as neuroendocrine tumour cells) so that the PET scan can take better pictures and doctors can better diagnose and manage the disease.\n\nHowever, despite 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans showing promise, it is still not widely accessible. Because of this, researchers are creating a registry for patients who may need 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans to:\n\n* Identify their primary tumour where the doctor suspects is a neuroendocrine tumour\n* Staging of the neuroendocrine tumour\n* Restage the tumour prior to surgery/radiotherapy or help to assess the tumour where standard scans such as CTs, MRIs, or octreoscans are not properly showing your tumours despite other clinical or laboratory tests showing that your disease has progressed\n* For other issues when confirmation of site of disease and/or disease extent may impact clinical management of the neuroendocrine tumour.\n\nThis registry help the participant's treating physician to obtain approval for the participant to undergo 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans for their neuroendocrine tumour.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and temozolomide work in treating patients with small-cell lung cancer that has come back or does not respond to treatment, or neuroendocrine cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy (using response rate per RECIST v1.1) of nivolumab and temozolomide for the treatment of patients with either small cell lung cancer that have progressed or recurred after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy (cohort 1), or progressive metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of any grade or primary site in any line of therapy (cohort 2).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety profile and toxicity of combination nivolumab and temozolomide as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5.0.\n\nII. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with combination nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIII. To evaluate the central nervous system (CNS) PFS of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether treatment with nivolumab and temozolomide leads to a decrease in immune-suppressive cell populations (ie myeloid-derived suppressor cells \\[MDSC\\]) in peripheral blood.\n\nII. To determine whether objective response rate (ORR), PFS, OS vary by tumor O6-methylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation at baseline.\n\nIII. To determine whether baseline tumor mutational burden is predictive of response to therapy in patients with SCLC treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIV. To determine whether changes in blood based mutation burden during treatment may predict clinical benefit.\n\nV. To determine whether a composite immune and tumor cell staining score can be developed with or without PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to predict response in the SCLC cohort.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of a 28 day cycle. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for 12 months, then every 12 weeks thereafter.",
