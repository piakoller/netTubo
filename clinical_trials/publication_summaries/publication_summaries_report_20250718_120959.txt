1. Angiogenesis inhibitors in neuroendocrine tumours: finally coming of age.
   PMID: 33152282
   Study: Testing Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine and Carcinoid Tumors (NCT03375320)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the potential role of angiogenesis inhibitors, specifically cabozantinib, in neuroendocrine tumor (NET) treatment, which is highly relevant given the patient’s progressive disease despite somatostatin analog therapy. The review suggests a growing role for these agents in NET management, particularly in advanced stages.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The review highlights that angiogenesis inhibitors are “coming of age” in NET treatment, moving beyond earlier disappointing results with agents like bevacizumab.
* Cabozantinib, a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic properties, is specifically discussed as a promising agent.
* Angiogenesis inhibitors target the tumor microenvironment, potentially overcoming resistance mechanisms to somatostatin analogs and other therapies.
* The review implies that targeting angiogenesis can improve outcomes in progressive NET disease.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progression on somatostatin analogs (somatoline) and the presence of liver metastases, cabozantinib should be strongly considered as a next-line therapy. The NCT03375320 study (Phase III) investigating cabozantinib in advanced pancreatic and carcinoid tumors provides a clinical trial framework for evaluating its efficacy. Given the patient’s history of surgical resection and current stable/slightly progressive disease, they may be a suitable candidate for this type of targeted therapy.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, progressive NETs (like this patient with liver metastases) who have failed or are refractory to first-line therapies such as somatostatin analogs. Patients with well-differentiated, low-grade NETs who are asymptomatic and have limited disease may not benefit as significantly.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The publication references a Phase III clinical trial (NCT03375320) evaluating cabozantinib, indicating a relatively high level of evidence. However, the provided abstract is unavailable, limiting a full assessment of the study’s patient numbers, specific endpoints, and detailed results. The review itself is a synthesis of available evidence, and its strength depends on the quality of the underlying studies it references.

2. 177Lu-Dotatate plus long-acting octreotide versus high&#x2011;dose long-acting octreotide in patients with midgut neuroendocrine tumours (NETTER-1): final overall survival and long-term safety results from an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.
   PMID: 34793718
   Study: A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to Octreotide LAR in Patients With Inoperable, Progressive, Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours (NCT01578239)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication is highly relevant for the treatment of patients with midgut NETs, specifically those with progressive disease. The study directly compares a novel peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) approach to the current standard of care, long-acting octreotide, and provides long-term survival data. The findings have the potential to significantly alter treatment paradigms for this patient population.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The NETTER-1 trial demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with 177Lu-Dotatate plus long-acting octreotide compared to high-dose long-acting octreotide alone.
* The final overall survival (OS) analysis confirms a trend towards improved OS with the addition of 177Lu-Dotatate, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.
* Long-term safety data suggests that 177Lu-Dotatate is generally well-tolerated, with manageable side effects.
* The combination therapy appears to offer a benefit in delaying disease progression and potentially improving long-term outcomes.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the NETTER-1 trial results, 177Lu-Dotatate in combination with long-acting octreotide should be considered as a treatment option for patients with advanced, progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive midgut NETs. Given the trend towards improved OS, it may be particularly beneficial for patients with a higher disease burden or those at risk of rapid progression.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with:
* Midgut NETs (specifically small intestinal NETs, as in the patient case).
* Inoperable or progressive disease.
* Somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive tumors (demonstrated through imaging like Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/CT).
* Patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to standard octreotide therapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong. This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (NETTER-1). While the exact number of patients isn’t stated in the abstract, Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of participants, providing robust data. The publication reports final overall survival and long-term safety results, representing a comprehensive analysis of the intervention.

3. Impact of liver tumour burden, alkaline phosphatase elevation, and target lesion size on treatment outcomes with 177Lu-Dotatate: an analysis of the NETTER-1 study.
   PMID: 32123969
   Study: A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to Octreotide LAR in Patients With Inoperable, Progressive, Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours (NCT01578239)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses treatment outcomes in patients with somatostatin receptor-positive midgut carcinoid tumors, which aligns with the patient’s diagnosis of a small intestinal NET. The study analyzes factors influencing response to 177Lu-Dotatate, a potentially valuable therapeutic option when conventional therapies fail or become less effective, as suggested by the patient’s progression despite somatostatin analog treatment.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   Higher baseline liver tumor burden is associated with poorer outcomes with 177Lu-Dotatate treatment.
*   Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at baseline also predicts worse progression-free survival (PFS) on 177Lu-Dotatate.
*   Larger target lesion size at baseline correlates with reduced benefit from 177Lu-Dotatate.
*   The study reinforces the importance of careful patient selection and baseline assessment for optimal treatment response.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progression on somatostatin analogs (Somatoline) and the presence of liver metastases, 177Lu-Dotatate should be strongly considered. However, the extent of liver involvement (tumor burden), current ALP levels, and the size of the target lesions should be carefully assessed *before* initiating treatment. If liver burden is high, ALP is elevated, or target lesions are large, the potential benefit may be limited, and alternative strategies (e.g., chemotherapy, clinical trials) should be explored.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with *inoperable, progressive*, somatostatin receptor-positive midgut carcinoid tumors, specifically those with liver metastases. The study focuses on patients who have progressed despite treatment with long-acting octreotide.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, stemming from a Phase 3 clinical trial (NETTER-1, NCT01578239). While the provided abstract doesn’t detail patient numbers, the NETTER-1 study enrolled 235 patients, providing a robust dataset for analysis. This is a retrospective analysis *of* that Phase 3 trial, adding further value to the existing data.

4. Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Progressive Midgut Neuroendocrine Tumors Treated With 177Lu-Dotatate in the Phase III NETTER-1 Trial.
   PMID: 29878866
   Study: A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to Octreotide LAR in Patients With Inoperable, Progressive, Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours (NCT01578239)
   Publication Date: 2018
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses a critical aspect of NET treatment – quality of life – alongside established efficacy measures like progression-free survival. The study provides valuable evidence supporting the use of 177Lu-Dotatate as a superior option to octreotide LAR in maintaining and improving patient well-being during treatment for progressive midgut NETs. This is particularly relevant when considering long-term management strategies for this patient population.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * 177Lu-Dotatate significantly prolonged the time to deterioration in health-related quality of life (TTD) across multiple domains compared to octreotide LAR.
* Clinically significant improvements in TTD were observed in global health status (28.8 vs 6.1 months) and physical functioning (25.2 vs 11.5 months) with 177Lu-Dotatate.
* The study demonstrates that 177Lu-Dotatate not only extends progression-free survival but also positively impacts patient-reported outcomes, including fatigue, pain, and disease-related worries.
* Hazard ratios consistently favored 177Lu-Dotatate across all QoL domains assessed, indicating a substantial benefit.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   For patients with progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive midgut NETs, 177Lu-Dotatate should be strongly considered as a first-line treatment option over high-dose octreotide LAR, given its demonstrated superiority in both progression-free survival and quality of life. The patient’s current stable disease on somatostatin analogs may indicate suitability for considering 177Lu-Dotatate if progression is observed.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with inoperable, progressive midgut neuroendocrine tumors (specifically small intestinal NETs) that are somatostatin receptor-positive. The study population included patients with measurable disease and adequate organ function to tolerate treatment.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, derived from a Phase III, randomized, controlled trial (NETTER-1) with a substantial sample size (n=117 in the 177Lu-Dotatate arm and n=114 in the octreotide LAR arm). The study utilized intention-to-treat analysis and employed validated quality-of-life questionnaires (QLQ C-30 and G.I.NET-21), enhancing the reliability of the findings.
----------------------------------------

5. Phase 3 Trial of 177Lu-Dotatate for Midgut Neuroendocrine Tumors.
   PMID: 28076709
   Study: A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to Octreotide LAR in Patients With Inoperable, Progressive, Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours (NCT01578239)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication is highly relevant for the treatment of the patient, as it directly addresses therapeutic options for progressive midgut neuroendocrine tumors following failure of somatostatin analogue therapy – precisely the situation this patient is facing. The study investigates a potential alternative to continued octreotide, offering a potentially more effective treatment strategy.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * 177Lu-Dotatate demonstrated efficacy in patients with advanced, progressive midgut NETs who had progressed *despite* first-line somatostatin analogue (SSA) therapy.
* The study provides evidence for improved progression-free survival (PFS) with 177Lu-Dotatate compared to octreotide LAR in this specific patient population. (While the abstract doesn't detail *how much* improvement, the study design suggests a benefit).
* 177Lu-Dotatate is targeted to somatostatin receptors, making receptor positivity a crucial factor for treatment success.
* The study confirms the feasibility and safety profile of 177Lu-Dotatate in this advanced disease setting.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progression on somatostatin analogue therapy (Somatoline), 177Lu-Dotatate should be strongly considered as a next-line treatment option, *provided* the patient remains somatostatin receptor positive. A repeat scan (e.g., Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/CT) to confirm receptor expression is essential before initiating therapy.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy is relevant for patients with:
* Advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors (like this patient’s ileal NET with liver metastases).
* Progressive disease *after* failing first-line treatment with a somatostatin analogue (SSA) like octreotide or lanreotide.
* Confirmed somatostatin receptor positivity (essential for targeting).

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong. This is a Phase 3, randomized, controlled trial (NCT01578239, PMID: 28076709). While the abstract doesn’t provide patient numbers, Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of patients, providing robust data for efficacy and safety assessment. The study design allows for a reliable comparison between 177Lu-Dotatate and continued octreotide LAR.

6. Efficacy and safety of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin in relapsed small cell lung cancer. Results from an expansion cohort of a phase I study.
   PMID: 33704620
   Study: Study Escalating Doses of PM01183 in Combination With Fixed Doxorubicin in Patients With Specific Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors (NCT01970540)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase I study evaluating lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin, originally in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). While the study focuses on SCLC, lurbinectedin has demonstrated activity in other cancers, including some NETs, by inducing DNA damage and disrupting cell cycle progression. Therefore, exploring its potential benefit in progressing NETs, particularly those refractory to somatostatin analogs, warrants consideration.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The combination of doxorubicin and lurbinectedin showed a 36% overall response rate (ORR) in relapsed SCLC patients.
* Patients with sensitive disease (longer chemotherapy-free interval) had a significantly higher ORR (50%) and improved PFS/OS compared to those with resistant disease.
* The primary toxicity observed was manageable myelosuppression, with mostly mild to moderate non-hematological side effects.
* The studied dose was doxorubicin 40mg/m2 and lurbinectedin 2.0mg/m2 administered every three weeks.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analog therapy and the limited options for advanced NETs, lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin could be considered as a potential off-label treatment option. Given the study’s findings, pretreatment assessment of disease sensitivity (based on time to progression on prior therapies) is crucial. A careful risk-benefit assessment is necessary, considering the potential for myelosuppression.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This combination might be most beneficial for patients with well-performing status and progressing, unresectable, well-differentiated or moderately differentiated NETs, particularly those who have not rapidly progressed on prior therapies (sensitive disease). Patients with significant bone marrow reserve are preferred. The study population in the original trial had relapsed SCLC after one line of chemotherapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to a Phase I expansion cohort study (NCT01970540) with 28 patients. While the results are promising, they are derived from a small sample size in a different cancer type (SCLC). A Phase III trial is ongoing in SCLC, but data specific to NETs are lacking. This represents preliminary evidence and should be interpreted cautiously. Further research, ideally in NET-specific clinical trials, is needed to confirm efficacy and safety.

7. Phase I Study of Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 Inhibitor, CC-90011, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
   PMID: 33046517
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor, as a potential therapy for advanced solid tumors, which *could* be relevant for this NET patient experiencing progression despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection. LSD1’s role in chemoresistance and cancer stem cells suggests a potential to overcome resistance mechanisms often seen in NETs. However, direct evidence for NET efficacy is currently lacking, and this study is early phase.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * CC-90011 is a potent, selective, and reversible oral LSD1 inhibitor.
* LSD1 inhibition is hypothesized to target cancer stem cells and potentially overcome chemoresistance.
* The study evaluated CC-90011 in patients with advanced solid tumors *and* relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, suggesting a broad potential application.
* The study primarily focused on safety and dose escalation, with limited efficacy data reported in the abstract.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs, and the limited treatment options for advanced NETs, CC-90011 *could* be considered within a clinical trial setting. Given the Phase I nature of the study, this would be an exploratory approach. Further investigation into LSD1 expression in the patient’s tumor tissue might help predict potential responsiveness.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with advanced solid tumors, including potentially NETs, who have relapsed or are refractory to standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy – if applicable). Patients with evidence of cancer stem cell involvement or chemoresistance might be particularly suitable, although biomarkers for these characteristics are not yet fully established.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is very limited. This is a Phase I study, primarily designed to assess safety and determine a recommended dose. Patient numbers are likely small, and efficacy data are not the primary focus. The abstract provides only a high-level overview; a full review of the publication is needed for a comprehensive understanding of the study design, results, and adverse events.
----------------------------------------

8. Clinical activity of CC-90011, an oral, potent, and reversible LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies.
   PMID: 35737639
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the Phase 1 study of CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies, including some hematological cancers. While not specifically focused on NETs, LSD1 inhibition is a potential therapeutic strategy being explored in various cancers, including some preclinical NET models, making this publication potentially relevant for treatment consideration, particularly in the context of progressing disease and limited options. The study’s findings warrant further investigation into the role of LSD1 inhibition in NETs.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * CC-90011 demonstrates clinical activity in advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma.
* The drug is orally bioavailable, potent, selective, and reversible in its inhibition of LSD1.
* CC-90011 was generally well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study.
* Long-term follow-up suggests durable responses in some patients, although the specific response rates are not detailed in the abstract.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analog therapy and prior surgical resection, CC-90011 could be considered as part of a clinical trial or, if available through expanded access programs, as a potential treatment option. Further investigation into biomarkers predictive of response to LSD1 inhibition in NETs is crucial before widespread use. Given the Phase 1 nature of the study, this should be approached cautiously.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors, including potentially NET patients, who have exhausted standard treatment options. Patients with progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs, as in this case, might be candidates for investigation of LSD1 inhibition. The study included patients with advanced malignancies, suggesting it may be more applicable to metastatic disease.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently low. This is a Phase 1 study, primarily focused on safety and dose escalation. While encouraging activity was observed, the patient numbers are likely small, and the study design does not allow for definitive conclusions about efficacy. Further studies (Phase 2 and 3) are needed to confirm these findings and establish the role of CC-90011 in NET treatment.
----------------------------------------

9. A Phase II Study of Ziv-Aflibercept in Patients With Advanced Extrapancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.
   PMID: 36395401
   Study: Ziv-Aflibercept for Advanced Progressive Carcinoid Tumors (NCT01782443)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses potential therapy for the patient’s advanced NET, specifically focusing on a VEGF inhibitor. Given the patient’s progression despite somatostatin analogs and the presence of liver metastases, exploring VEGF-targeted therapies like ziv-aflibercept is clinically relevant. The study investigates a mechanism (VEGF inhibition) frequently implicated in NET angiogenesis and growth.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Ziv-aflibercept targets VEGF, a protein often overexpressed in NETs, potentially inhibiting tumor growth by reducing angiogenesis.
* The study demonstrates activity of ziv-aflibercept in advanced extrapancreatic NETs, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit.
* While the abstract doesn’t detail specific response rates, the study’s existence (Phase II trial) indicates some preliminary efficacy signal warranting further investigation.
* VEGF expression is a characteristic of NETs, making this a rational therapeutic target.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consideration should be given to ziv-aflibercept as a potential treatment option for this patient, given the progression of disease despite somatostatin analog therapy. Further investigation of the full publication is needed to assess response rates, progression-free survival, and toxicity profiles. A discussion with a NET specialist regarding the patient’s specific characteristics and potential benefits versus risks is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* extrapancreatic NETs (like this patient’s small bowel NET with liver metastases) who have *progressive* disease. Patients who have failed or are refractory to first-line therapies, such as somatostatin analogs, are the most appropriate candidates.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate, stemming from a Phase II clinical trial (NCT01782443). Phase II trials are designed to assess activity and safety, not definitive efficacy. The abstract provides no information on patient numbers, response rates, or statistical significance. Further data from larger, randomized Phase III trials would be needed to establish ziv-aflibercept as a standard of care.

10. Dual inactivation of Akt and ERK by TIC10 signals Foxo3a nuclear translocation, TRAIL gene induction, and potent antitumor effects.
   PMID: 23390247
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2013
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the mechanism of action of TIC10, a small molecule inducing TRAIL expression, which has potential relevance for NET therapy as TRAIL-based therapies aim to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. While NETs can exhibit variable sensitivity to apoptosis induction, exploring agents that enhance endogenous TRAIL expression could be a valuable therapeutic strategy, particularly in cases of progressive disease despite somatostatin analog treatment.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * TIC10 is an orally active small molecule that induces TRAIL expression in both tumor and normal cells, independent of p53 status.
* TIC10 inactivates the Akt and ERK signaling pathways, key pathways often dysregulated in NETs and contributing to cell survival.
* Inactivation of Akt/ERK leads to Foxo3a translocation to the nucleus, directly upregulating TRAIL gene transcription.
* TIC10 demonstrates antitumor activity by enhancing endogenous TRAIL levels, potentially overcoming limitations of recombinant TRAIL therapies.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressive disease despite somatostatin analog therapy (Somatoline), and the mechanism of action of TIC10, exploring clinical trials investigating TIC10 (as in NCT03034200) should be considered. TIC10 could potentially be used as a single agent or in combination with other therapies, such as targeted agents or chemotherapy, to enhance antitumor activity. Further investigation into biomarkers predicting TIC10 response would be beneficial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy may be most relevant for patients with progressive, well-differentiated or moderately differentiated NETs who have exhausted other treatment options, including somatostatin analogs. Patients with tumors exhibiting low baseline TRAIL expression might be particularly responsive, although this requires further investigation. The study suggests potential for brain metastasis treatment due to blood-brain barrier penetration, making it relevant for patients with cerebral involvement.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented originates from a preclinical study (in vitro and likely in vivo models, not specified in the abstract). The study demonstrates a compelling mechanism of action but lacks clinical data. The referenced NCT ID (NCT03034200) indicates a Phase 2 clinical trial is underway, suggesting initial clinical investigation. Therefore, the evidence is currently low-level and requires results from the ongoing clinical trial to determine efficacy and safety in humans.
----------------------------------------

11. Identification of TRAIL-inducing compounds highlights small molecule ONC201/TIC10 as a unique anti-cancer agent that activates the TRAIL pathway.
   PMID: 25927855
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2015
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the mechanism of action of ONC201/TIC10, a small molecule inducing the TRAIL pathway, which has potential relevance for NET treatment as TRAIL induction can lead to cancer cell death. Given the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection, exploring novel therapies like ONC201 is warranted. However, the publication itself doesn’t specifically address NETs; its relevance stems from the general anti-cancer potential and the mechanism of action.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * ONC201/TIC10 is a small molecule that induces the expression of the TRAIL gene.
* TRAIL is a protein that can trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells.
* ONC201/TIC10 aims to overcome limitations of recombinant TRAIL by improving its efficacy.
* Preclinical models demonstrated promising safety and antitumor efficacy with ONC201/TIC10.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite initial stabilization with somatostatin analogs, enrollment in the Phase 2 study of ONC201 (NCT03034200) should be strongly considered. This study is specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ONC201 in neuroendocrine tumors. If study enrollment isn't possible, exploring compassionate use options for ONC201 should be investigated.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy may be relevant for patients with advanced NETs, particularly those who have progressed on or are intolerant to standard therapies like somatostatin analogs. The study (NCT03034200) inclusion/exclusion criteria will define the specific patient population being investigated, but generally targets patients with measurable disease and adequate organ function. The patient’s history of progressing liver metastases despite initial response to somatostatin analogs makes them a potentially suitable candidate.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented in this publication is preclinical, demonstrating the mechanism of action and initial efficacy in models. The study referenced (NCT03034200) is a Phase 2 clinical trial, which provides preliminary evidence of efficacy and safety in humans. Phase 2 trials typically involve a limited number of patients and are not designed to be definitive. Further evidence from larger, randomized Phase 3 trials would be needed to establish the role of ONC201 in NET treatment.

12. Genetic and Pharmacological Screens Converge in Identifying FLIP, BCL2, and IAP Proteins as Key Regulators of Sensitivity to the TRAIL-Inducing Anticancer Agent ONC201/TIC10.
   PMID: 25681273
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2015
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the mechanism of action and potential synergistic effects of ONC201, a TRAIL-inducing agent, in cancer treatment. While the study doesn’t specifically focus on neuroendocrine tumors, the identified pathways regulating ONC201 sensitivity (FLIP, BCL2, IAP proteins) and synergistic interactions with sorafenib could be relevant for NET patients, particularly those with progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs. The potential to enhance response with combination therapy warrants consideration.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 induces TRAIL expression, leading to cancer cell death.
*   Sensitivity to ONC201 is regulated by anti-apoptotic proteins like FLIP, BCL2, and IAP proteins; downregulation of these proteins enhances ONC201’s efficacy.
*   ONC201 demonstrates synergistic effects when combined with sorafenib, leading to increased TRAIL/DR5 induction and tumor regression in a hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model.
*   KSR1 silencing impacts ONC201 sensitivity by reducing anti-apoptotic protein expression, suggesting a potential indirect mechanism of action.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider ONC201, potentially in combination with sorafenib, as a therapeutic option for patients with progressing NETs, particularly those who have demonstrated stability on somatostatin analogs but are now showing signs of progression. Biomarker analysis for FLIP, BCL2, and IAP protein expression could potentially identify patients most likely to respond. Further investigation within NET-specific models is needed before widespread clinical application.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced, progressing NETs who have exhausted other treatment options (e.g., somatostatin analogs, surgery, locoregional therapies) may be candidates. Patients with tumors exhibiting high expression of FLIP, BCL2, or IAP proteins *might* be more responsive, but this requires validation. The study’s initial success was in hepatocellular carcinoma, so response in other NET subtypes is unknown.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to a Phase 2 study (NCT03034200) and preclinical data (mouse xenograft model). The study focuses on hepatocellular carcinoma, not NETs. The findings are based on *in vitro* and *in vivo* experiments, and clinical trials specifically evaluating ONC201 in NET patients are needed to confirm these results. The patient numbers within the cited publication are not specified, but the study is a Phase 2 trial, suggesting a limited cohort size.

13. Discovery and clinical introduction of first-in-class imipridone ONC201.
   PMID: 27602582
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2016
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the discovery and early clinical development of ONC201, a novel imipridone with potential anti-cancer activity. While not specifically focused on NETs, the broad anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects observed across various tumor types suggest potential relevance for NET treatment, particularly in cases refractory to standard therapies. The unique mechanism of action, independent of p53 status, is noteworthy as many NETs exhibit p53 alterations.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 induces TRAIL gene transcription via a novel mechanism involving PERK-independent integrated stress response, DR5 upregulation, and Akt/ERK/Foxo3a pathway modulation.
*   Preclinical studies demonstrate anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of ONC201 against a broad range of tumor cells while sparing normal cells.
*   First-in-human trials show ONC201 is exceptionally well-tolerated, establishing a recommended Phase II dose of 625mg orally every three weeks.
*   ONC201 is orally bioavailable with sustained pharmacodynamic effects and is not genotoxic.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analog therapy and prior surgical resection, ONC201 could be considered within a clinical trial setting (as indicated by NCT03034200). Given the mechanism of action, it may be particularly interesting in patients where other targeted therapies have failed or are not suitable. Further investigation of ONC201 in combination with existing NET therapies should be explored.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, aggressive, and refractory solid tumors, including potentially those with NETs. The study doesn’t specify NET subtypes, but the broad activity suggests it could be explored across different NET types, particularly those with limited treatment options. Patients with progressing disease despite standard therapies (somatostatin analogs, surgery) are prime candidates for clinical trial participation.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented is currently limited to Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. The Phase 1 trial primarily focused on safety and dose determination. While the drug is well-tolerated, efficacy data is still emerging from ongoing Phase 2 trials (including NCT03034200). The evidence base is therefore preliminary, and further studies are needed to establish the efficacy of ONC201 in NET patients. Patient numbers in the Phase 1 trial were likely small, typical for early-phase studies.

14. Efficacy of ONC201 in Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor.
   PMID: 29626752
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2018
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication focuses on Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT), a rare sarcoma, and is of *limited* direct relevance to the presented NET patient with a small intestinal neuroendocrine tumor and liver metastases. While both DSRCT and NET can metastasize to the liver and require systemic therapy, the underlying biology and molecular drivers are distinct. However, the study’s investigation of inducing apoptosis via TRAIL receptor activation with ONC201 *could* be relevant if similar apoptotic pathways are dysregulated in the patient’s NET.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201, an agonistic small molecule, induces apoptosis in DSRCT cells *in vitro*.
*   ONC201 inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft models of DSRCT.
*   Apoptosis induction was associated with caspase activation, suggesting a functional apoptotic pathway.
*   DSRCT cells express TRAIL receptors (TRAILR1-4), making them susceptible to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based *solely* on this publication, ONC201 should *not* be considered standard therapy for this NET patient. However, given the progression despite somatostatin analogs and the limited treatment options, *exploratory* investigation of ONC201 within a clinical trial (if available for NETs) could be considered. Prior to considering ONC201, comprehensive molecular profiling of the patient’s tumor to assess TRAIL receptor expression and pathway activity is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are primarily relevant to patients with DSRCT, particularly those with progressive disease despite standard multimodal therapy. For NET patients, it *might* be relevant for those with progressive disease who have tumors demonstrating dysregulation of apoptotic pathways and/or expression of TRAIL receptors. This requires further investigation on a case-by-case basis.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak for NET therapy. This is a Phase 2 study focused on DSRCT. The study utilized *in vitro* cell lines and *in vivo* xenograft models, which may not fully translate to human NET biology. Patient numbers are not reported in the abstract, and the study’s focus is not on NETs. Further research specifically evaluating ONC201 in NET models and patients is needed.

15. Cancer stem cell-related gene expression as a potential biomarker of response for first-in-class imipridone ONC201 in solid tumors.
   PMID: 28767654
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the potential of ONC201, a first-in-class imipridone, as a therapy targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs). While the study primarily focuses on colorectal, prostate, and glioblastoma cancers, the underlying principle of targeting CSCs is relevant to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) as CSCs are implicated in recurrence and metastasis across various cancers, including NETs. Identifying predictive biomarkers for ONC201 response could be valuable if the drug demonstrates efficacy in NETs.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 targets self-renewing CSCs via Akt/ERK inhibition and DR5/TRAIL induction.
*   ONC201 downregulates stem cell pathways like Wnt signaling and modulates genes (ID1, ID2, ID3, ALDH7A1) involved in self-renewal.
*   Basal expression levels of CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3) correlate with ONC201 efficacy across a large panel of cancer cell lines.
*   ONC201 efficacy is lost in cells that develop resistance, and this resistance correlates with a loss of CSC depletion.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study suggests that prior to initiating ONC201 treatment, assessing the expression levels of CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3) in the patient’s tumor could help predict response. If these genes are highly expressed, the patient may be more likely to benefit from ONC201. The NCT03034200 trial is actively investigating ONC201 in NETs and should be considered as a potential treatment option, particularly if standard therapies have failed or are not suitable.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced NETs who have progressed on or are intolerant to standard therapies (somatostatin analogs, mTOR inhibitors, chemotherapy) may be candidates for ONC201, *particularly* if their tumors exhibit high expression of the identified CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3). The study suggests the drug may be most effective in patients without pre-existing resistance mechanisms.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to Phase 1/2 clinical trials and *in vitro* studies. The study demonstrates promising preclinical rationale and biomarker identification, but clinical efficacy in NETs specifically is still under investigation (NCT03034200). The biomarker correlations were observed in >1000 cancer cell lines, providing some robustness, but require validation in NET patient samples.

16. Defining Moments: Making Time for Virtual Visits and Catalyzing Better Cancer Care.
   PMID: 30907145
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication is largely *irrelevant* to direct NET therapy recommendations. The article focuses on the implementation and benefits of virtual healthcare visits for cancer patients, specifically regarding communication and access to care, not on novel therapeutic interventions or efficacy data for NETs. While improved patient care and communication are important, this study doesn’t address the clinical question of further therapy for progressing NET disease.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Virtual visits can improve access to expert cancer care.
* Virtual visits allow for unrushed, informative consultations with physicians.
* Effective documentation and follow-up via electronic medical records and email are crucial components of virtual care.
* The Cleveland Clinic successfully integrated virtual visits into their cancer care pathway.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   This publication does *not* offer specific treatment recommendations for NETs. It suggests utilizing virtual visits to *support* existing treatment plans by improving communication, monitoring, and overall patient care. It doesn't address whether to continue Somatoline, consider chemotherapy, targeted therapies, or other interventions.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The benefits of virtual visits apply to all cancer patients, including those with NETs, who can benefit from improved access to care, convenient follow-up, and enhanced communication with their healthcare team. This is particularly relevant for patients living far from specialized centers or with mobility limitations.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is a descriptive report of a healthcare system’s implementation of virtual visits (Phase 0/implementation study). It lacks robust clinical trial data (Phase I/II/III) and does not report patient numbers related to NETs specifically. The evidence is therefore weak regarding direct therapeutic impact, focusing instead on process and patient experience.

17. Phase II Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors including Pheochromocytoma-Paraganglioma and Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor.
   PMID: 35022321
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores ONC201, a DRD2 antagonist, as a potential therapy for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). While the study includes NETs, the primary focus appears to be on pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma (PC-PG) and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), making its direct relevance to small intestinal NETs with liver metastases somewhat limited without further data on DRD2 expression in this specific subtype. However, exploring novel targets is crucial for progressive NETs, justifying consideration.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * ONC201 is a bitopic DRD2 antagonist, meaning it blocks dopamine-like receptors.
* Preclinical activity of ONC201 has been demonstrated in desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT).
* The study suggests DRD2 receptor expression is higher in PC-PG compared to other cancers, hinting at potential responsiveness in those tumors.
* The abstract does *not* provide specific efficacy data for NETs generally, or small intestinal NETs specifically.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Given the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analog therapy and prior surgical resection, and the limited data presented here, ONC201 *could* be considered within a clinical trial setting. Prior assessment of DRD2 expression in the patient’s tumor tissue would be crucial to determine potential benefit. It is not a standard-of-care recommendation based solely on this publication.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The study includes NET patients, but the abstract doesn’t specify the NET subtypes. Patients with NETs who have progressed on standard therapies (somatostatin analogs, mTOR inhibitors, chemotherapy) and potentially exhibit high DRD2 expression in their tumors might be candidates for ONC201. Further investigation is needed to determine if small intestinal NETs with liver metastases are likely to benefit.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited to a Phase II study (NCT03034200). Phase II studies are designed to assess safety and preliminary efficacy, not to confirm benefit. The abstract provides no information on patient numbers, response rates, or overall survival data for NET patients specifically. Therefore, the evidence is preliminary and requires further investigation in larger, randomized controlled trials.

18. Circulating tumour cells and tumour biomarkers in functional midgut neuroendocrine tumours.
   PMID: 35132704
   Study: Circulating Tumour Cells in Somatuline Autogel Treated NeuroEndocrine Tumours Patients (NCT02075606)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the predictive value of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with functional midgut NETs treated with lanreotide autogel (LAN). It provides potential insights into identifying patients who may be less likely to respond symptomatically to LAN, potentially guiding treatment decisions and the need for alternative or adjunctive therapies. The study focuses on symptomatic control, a key aspect of NET management.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Patients *without* detectable CTCs at baseline showed a trend towards a higher likelihood of symptomatic response to LAN, although this was not statistically significant (OR 0.17, p=0.126).
* The one-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate was 66.4%, suggesting LAN provides disease stabilization in a substantial portion of patients.
* Plasma and urinary 5-HIAA levels strongly correlated during LAN treatment, indicating consistency in biomarker monitoring across different sample types.
* Baseline CTC status did not correlate with changes in plasma or urinary biomarkers.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider CTC enumeration at baseline *before* initiating LAN therapy in functional midgut NET patients. While not definitive, the presence of CTCs may suggest a lower likelihood of symptomatic benefit from LAN alone and prompt consideration of alternative or combination therapies (e.g., adding other somatostatin analogs, targeted therapies, or systemic chemotherapy). Monitoring of 5-HIAA in either plasma or urine is acceptable, given their strong correlation.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with *functional*, *well or moderately differentiated* (Ki-67 <20%) midgut neuroendocrine tumors. The study specifically included patients receiving LAN 120mg every 28 days.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate. This is a Phase IV, exploratory study with a sample size of 50 patients (40 completed). The lack of statistical significance for the CTC/symptomatic response association limits the strength of the recommendation. It is an observational study within a defined treatment protocol, and further prospective, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish CTCs as a reliable predictive biomarker.

19. Expression of somatostatin receptors 2 and 5 in circulating tumour cells from patients with neuroendocrine tumours.
   PMID: 27875519
   Study: Circulating Tumour Cells in Somatuline Autogel Treated NeuroEndocrine Tumours Patients (NCT02075606)
   Publication Date: 2016
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the therapeutic utility of somatostatin analogs (specifically lanreotide acetate, as indicated by the NCT ID) in NET patients by investigating somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression on circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Assessing SSTR expression on CTCs could potentially refine patient selection for somatostatin analog therapy and monitor treatment response more accurately than current imaging techniques. This is particularly relevant given the patient’s current stable disease on somatuline with a suspicion of progression.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   SSTR2 and SSTR5 expression can be measured on CTCs in NET patients.
*   Measuring SSTR expression on CTCs allows for investigation of heterogeneity in receptor expression within a patient, something difficult to assess with standard imaging.
*   CTC SSTR expression can be tracked during therapy, potentially indicating changes in treatment sensitivity.
*   The study suggests CTC analysis could be a biomarker for predicting response to somatostatin analog therapy.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   While this study doesn’t *recommend* a specific change in therapy, it supports the potential use of CTC SSTR expression analysis as a companion diagnostic to optimize somatostatin analog treatment. In the context of the patient’s suspected progression despite somatuline treatment, assessing SSTR2/5 expression on CTCs could help determine if continued somatuline therapy is likely to be effective, or if alternative therapies (e.g., PRRT, chemotherapy) should be considered. Further investigation of CTC SSTR expression before and after therapy adjustments could help personalize treatment.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with NETs who are candidates for somatostatin analog therapy (like the presented patient). It’s particularly valuable for patients exhibiting stable disease or suspected progression on somatostatin analogs, where assessing continued receptor expression is crucial. Patients with well-differentiated NETs expressing SSTRs are the primary target population.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate. This is a Phase 4 study (post-marketing surveillance/real-world evidence) with an NCT ID (NCT02075606), suggesting a relatively large observational study. However, the abstract provides limited details regarding patient numbers, study design (prospective vs. retrospective), and statistical power. The study establishes *feasibility* of CTC SSTR analysis but doesn’t demonstrate a direct correlation with clinical outcomes or treatment response in a definitive manner. Further prospective, controlled trials are needed to validate these findings.

20. Patient-reported symptom burden in patients with rare cancers receiving pembrolizumab in a phase II Clinical Trial.
   PMID: 35999229
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication assesses symptom burden in patients with rare cancers, including those potentially treated with pembrolizumab. While not NET-specific, the findings are relevant as NETs are considered rare cancers and pembrolizumab is an emerging therapeutic option, particularly in progressive disease. Understanding the expected symptom profile is crucial for patient management and supportive care during immunotherapy.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab treatment in patients with rare cancers is associated with significant symptom burden, notably fatigue, pain, disturbed sleep, drowsiness, and lack of appetite.
* Approximately 43% of patients experienced a high symptom burden based on a composite score of the most severe symptoms, even *before* starting treatment.
* Immunotherapy-specific symptoms (rash, diarrhea) contributed to a high symptom burden in 33% of patients.
* Symptom trajectories remained relatively stable over the 9-week treatment period, suggesting early symptom assessment is important for ongoing management.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   * Consider proactive symptom management, particularly for fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbances, when initiating pembrolizumab treatment in NET patients.
* Implement regular symptom assessment using tools like the MDASI-Immunotherapy to identify and address individual patient needs.
* Early intervention with supportive care (e.g., pain management, sleep aids, nutritional support) may improve quality of life during pembrolizumab therapy.
* Given the stable symptom trajectories, a baseline symptom assessment should be performed to establish a reference point for monitoring changes during treatment.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, unresectable or metastatic NETs who are being considered for or are receiving pembrolizumab therapy. The study population included patients with various rare solid tumors, suggesting the symptom profile may be generalizable to NET patients, although NET-specific symptom profiles may differ. Patients with a high baseline symptom burden should be carefully evaluated before initiating treatment.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is derived from a Phase II clinical trial (NCT02721732) with a relatively small sample size (53 patients) across various rare cancers. While the prospective longitudinal design and use of a validated symptom inventory (MDASI) strengthen the findings, the generalizability to NET patients specifically is limited. Further research specifically focused on NET patients receiving pembrolizumab is needed to confirm these findings and refine treatment recommendations.

21. Efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced cancer of unknown primary (CUP): a phase 2 non-randomized clinical trial.
   PMID: 35618285
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   While this study focuses on Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP), the underlying principle of evaluating pembrolizumab as a treatment option is relevant to NET patients, particularly those with progressive disease despite somatostatin analogs and surgical interventions, as seen in the patient context. NETs, especially those that are poorly differentiated or have limited somatostatin receptor expression, may share similar immunologic vulnerabilities explored in CUP research. Therefore, exploring immunotherapy options like pembrolizumab warrants consideration.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study demonstrates that pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, shows clinical activity in patients with CUP, a challenging cancer with limited treatment options.
* Pembrolizumab offers a potential therapeutic avenue when standard treatments have failed or are not feasible.
* The study highlights the need for further investigation of immune checkpoint inhibitors in rare and aggressive cancers.
* While not a primary finding, the study supports the concept that immunotherapy *can* be effective even when the primary tumor site is unknown, suggesting potential benefit regardless of complete characterization of the NET.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider pembrolizumab as a potential treatment option for this patient with progressive small bowel NET and liver metastases, particularly given the limited response to somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection. A discussion regarding potential biomarkers predictive of response (e.g., PD-L1 expression, MSI-H status – though these are not specifically addressed in this abstract) should be undertaken. Enrollment in clinical trials evaluating pembrolizumab or other immunotherapies in NETs is strongly encouraged.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with advanced NETs (like this patient with liver metastases) who have experienced disease progression despite standard therapies (surgery and somatostatin analogs). Patients with limited treatment options and a high tumor burden may be most likely to benefit. The study doesn't specify NET subtypes, but could be considered for well-differentiated or poorly-differentiated NETs with progressive disease.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate. This is a Phase 2, non-randomized clinical trial (NCT02721732). While the study demonstrates potential efficacy, the lack of randomization and relatively small sample size (details not provided in the abstract) limit the strength of the conclusions. Further investigation in larger, randomized controlled trials specifically focused on NETs is needed to confirm these findings and establish optimal treatment strategies.

22. Letter to the editor from Pant et al.
   PMID: 34725215
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase II study (NCT02721732) investigating pembrolizumab for rare tumors, including potentially NETs, that are unresectable or metastatic. Given the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection, exploring immunotherapy options like pembrolizumab is clinically relevant. The study’s focus on tumors with limited treatment options makes it particularly pertinent to this case.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study investigates pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, as a potential treatment for rare tumors.
* The study includes biomarker analysis, suggesting a potential for identifying patients most likely to respond to pembrolizumab.
* While the abstract is unavailable, the study design suggests an evaluation of pembrolizumab’s efficacy in a heavily pre-treated patient population.
* The study’s inclusion criteria focus on unresectable or metastatic disease, aligning with the current clinical scenario.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progression despite somatostatin analogs, pembrolizumab should be considered as a potential therapeutic option. Further investigation into the patient’s tumor’s PD-L1 expression and microsatellite instability (MSI) status (if available through biomarker analysis) would be crucial, as these factors may predict response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Enrollment in clinical trials evaluating pembrolizumab or other immune checkpoint inhibitors should be actively pursued.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy is relevant for patients with unresectable or metastatic NETs, particularly those who have progressed on or are intolerant to standard therapies like somatostatin analogs. Patients with tumors exhibiting high PD-L1 expression or MSI-high status may be more likely to benefit. The study likely included patients with various rare tumor types, so NET patients would be a subset.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently moderate, stemming from a Phase II clinical trial (NCT02721732). Phase II trials are designed to assess efficacy and safety but are not definitive. The lack of an available abstract limits a full assessment. Patient numbers are unknown without access to the full publication, but Phase II trials typically involve a limited number of patients. Further data from larger, randomized Phase III trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in NETs.

23. Pembrolizumab in Patients with Refractory Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Phase&#xa0;II Trial.
   PMID: 34241781
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, focusing on pembrolizumab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), has *potential* relevance to NET therapy due to the mechanism of action – PD-1 inhibition. While the study doesn’t directly address NETs, PD-1/PD-L1 expression has been observed in some NETs, suggesting a possible response to immunotherapy. However, extrapolating results from CSCC to NETs requires caution.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrates antitumor activity in refractory advanced CSCC.
* Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis shows promise in a cancer setting where conventional therapies have failed.
* The study assesses the safety profile of pembrolizumab, which is crucial for considering its use in other cancer types.
* The trial demonstrates that immunotherapy can be a viable option for patients with limited treatment options.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection, *exploring* pembrolizumab as a potential treatment option could be considered, *particularly if PD-L1 expression is detected in the patient’s tumor*. This should be done within a clinical trial setting if possible, or with careful consideration of the risk/benefit ratio. Biomarker analysis (PD-L1 expression) is crucial before initiating treatment.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings *might* be relevant for NET patients who have: 1) progressed on standard therapies (somatostatin analogs, surgery); 2) have limited treatment options; and 3) potentially demonstrate PD-L1 expression in their tumor tissue. The patient in question, with progressing liver metastases despite somatostatin analogs, falls into this category.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak for NET therapy specifically. This is a Phase II trial (NCT02721732) in CSCC, not NET. While Phase II trials assess safety and preliminary efficacy, they are not definitive. The patient numbers in the study are not specified in the abstract, but Phase II trials generally involve a limited number of patients. Further research specifically focused on NETs is needed to confirm the efficacy of pembrolizumab in this patient population.

24. Pembrolizumab for advanced penile cancer: a case series from a phase II basket trial.
   PMID: 33770291
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, focusing on pembrolizumab in penile squamous cell carcinoma, has *limited* direct relevance to the treatment of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NET). However, the study investigates PD-L1 expression and response to an immune checkpoint inhibitor, which is a therapeutic avenue increasingly explored in NETs, particularly those with limited treatment options. The potential for PD-L1 expression in NETs warrants consideration of findings from studies in other tumor types.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated activity in a subset of patients with advanced penile SCC.
* A significant proportion (40-62%) of penile SCC patients express PD-L1, suggesting potential responsiveness to anti-PD-1 therapy.
* The case series highlights the possibility of utilizing pembrolizumab in heavily pre-treated patients with limited alternatives.
* While not directly assessed in this study, PD-L1 expression may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting response to pembrolizumab.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Given the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection, consideration of pembrolizumab *could* be explored, *specifically after PD-L1 expression in the patient’s tumor is assessed*. This would be an off-label use, and should be discussed within a multidisciplinary tumor board. Further investigation into PD-L1 status of the NET is crucial before initiating treatment.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings *might* be relevant for NET patients with advanced, metastatic disease who have progressed on standard therapies (somatostatin analogs, surgery). Patients with high PD-L1 expression in their NET tumors are more likely to benefit, although this remains to be definitively proven in NET-specific trials. The patient in question, with progressing liver metastases, falls into this category for *potential* consideration.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak. This is a Phase II basket trial reporting a case series of only three patients with penile SCC. While suggestive, the small sample size and the different tumor type limit the strength of the conclusions and the direct applicability to NET treatment. Larger, prospective trials specifically evaluating pembrolizumab in NETs are needed to establish its efficacy and safety.

25. Pembrolizumab in Patients with Advanced Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors.
   PMID: 33491277
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication regarding pembrolizumab in germ cell tumors has *limited* direct relevance to the presented NET patient. While both are cancers, germ cell tumors have significantly different biology and immunotherapy response profiles than neuroendocrine tumors. However, exploring immunotherapy options for progressing NETs is increasingly common, making any data on PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors potentially informative, albeit cautiously.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated limited anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated germ cell tumors.
* Stable disease was observed in 3/12 patients, lasting between 4.5 and 10.9 months.
* Low tumor mutational burden and low PD-1 expression are suggested as potential mechanisms of resistance to pembrolizumab.
* Tumor profiling is recommended to understand resistance mechanisms and guide future immunotherapy trials.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Given the progression of the patient’s disease despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection, considering pembrolizumab *could* be explored, but *only* after comprehensive tumor profiling (including PD-L1 expression and mutational burden). This should be framed as an experimental approach, given the limited efficacy observed in germ cell tumors and the potential for lack of response in NETs. Prior to initiating, a multidisciplinary tumor board discussion is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings *might* be relevant for NET patients who have progressed through standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, potentially systemic chemotherapy) and have tumors with potentially high PD-L1 expression or a higher mutational burden (as determined by genomic profiling). It is *not* a first-line or even second-line recommendation.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak. This is a Phase II study with a very small patient cohort (n=12) of germ cell tumor patients. The findings are preliminary and cannot be directly extrapolated to NET patients. The study confirms existing limited data on immunotherapy in germ cell tumors, but does not provide strong evidence for efficacy.

26. Efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with pituitary carcinoma: report of four cases from a phase II study.
   PMID: 33427689
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the efficacy of pembrolizumab in pituitary carcinoma, a neuroendocrine tumor, albeit a different primary site than the patient’s small bowel NET. While not directly applicable to small bowel NET, the study explores immunotherapy – a potential treatment avenue increasingly investigated for various NET subtypes, particularly those with specific genomic profiles. Therefore, the findings offer potential insights into the broader role of checkpoint inhibitors in NET treatment.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated partial radiographic and hormonal responses in two out of four patients with refractory pituitary carcinoma.
* Response to pembrolizumab correlated with a hypermutator phenotype (MSH2/MSH6 mutations) observed *after* prior treatment with temozolomide.
* PD-L1 expression was negative in all tumors, suggesting response isn’t necessarily linked to PD-L1 status.
* Stable disease was observed in one patient, while one patient experienced progressive disease.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection, exploring immunotherapy with pembrolizumab *could* be considered, particularly if genomic testing reveals a hypermutator phenotype, ideally *after* prior chemotherapy (though this is not standard practice for small bowel NET). Biomarker analysis, specifically mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutation testing (MSH2/MSH6), should be performed on tumor tissue.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced, metastatic NET who have progressed on standard therapies (somatostatin analogs, surgery, potentially chemotherapy) and who exhibit a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) or MMR deficiency. The study suggests a potential benefit in patients whose tumors develop a hypermutator phenotype following alkylating agent chemotherapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited. This is a Phase II study with a very small sample size (n=4) focusing on pituitary carcinoma, not small bowel NET. The findings are preliminary and require confirmation in larger, prospective trials specifically designed for small bowel NET patients. The correlation between hypermutation and response needs further investigation.

27. The clinical efficacy and safety of single-agent pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent granulosa cell tumors of the ovary: a case series from a phase II basket trial.
   PMID: 33415580
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the use of pembrolizumab in granulosa cell tumors of the ovary, a rare cancer. While not directly applicable to small intestinal NETs, the study explores the potential of immunotherapy – specifically a PD-1 inhibitor – in rare cancers with limited treatment options, a situation often encountered in NET management. Therefore, it provides potentially valuable insights into the broader application of immunotherapy in rare tumor types, including NETs.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated disease control (≥12 months) in 2 out of 5 patients with recurrent granulosa cell tumors, despite prior extensive systemic therapy.
* No objective responses (per irRECIST) were observed, suggesting pembrolizumab is unlikely to be a highly effective single agent in all cases.
* PD-L1 expression was absent in all tested tumor samples, indicating response may not be linked to PD-L1 status.
* Pembrolizumab was well-tolerated with no grade 3 or 4 adverse events.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection, pembrolizumab *could* be considered as part of a clinical trial or off-label use, particularly if other standard therapies are exhausted. However, it should not be considered a standard of care based on this evidence alone. Biomarker analysis (beyond PD-L1) to identify potential responders would be prudent.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study suggests potential benefit in patients with advanced, recurrent NETs (or other rare cancers) who have progressed on multiple lines of prior therapy and have limited treatment options. The observed benefit appears more likely in adult-type tumors, though this is based on a small sample size. Patients with stable disease on prior therapies might be less likely to benefit.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited. This is a Phase II basket trial case series of only 5 patients with granulosa cell tumors. The small sample size and lack of a control arm significantly limit the strength of the conclusions. While the safety profile is encouraging, the efficacy data is preliminary and requires further investigation in larger, prospective trials specifically designed for NETs.

28. Phase II study of pembrolizumab efficacy and safety in women with recurrent small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lower genital tract.
   PMID: 32534809
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, while focused on small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) of the lower genital tract, holds *potential* relevance for the patient with a small bowel NET and metastatic disease. Both are neuroendocrine tumors, and while differing in histology and primary site, they may share sensitivities to immunotherapies like pembrolizumab. However, direct extrapolation requires caution due to the distinct biological characteristics of different NET subtypes.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study investigated pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, in recurrent SCNEC.
* The abstract doesn’t provide efficacy data (response rate, PFS, OS) – only that efficacy and safety were investigated. Full text review would be needed for specifics.
* Pembrolizumab was evaluated for its safety profile in this patient population.
* The study suggests exploring immunotherapy as a potential treatment option in recurrent neuroendocrine carcinomas.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection, pembrolizumab *could* be considered as a potential treatment option, *but only after careful multidisciplinary discussion*. Given the limited data for small bowel NETs specifically, this would likely be an off-label use. Biomarker analysis (PD-L1 expression, MSI-H status) should be performed to assess potential predictive markers of response.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The study focused on women with *recurrent* small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lower genital tract. While this is a different primary site and histology than the patient’s small bowel NET, the findings *might* be relevant for patients with progressive, metastatic NET who have exhausted other treatment options, particularly if their tumor exhibits features suggestive of immune sensitivity.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited. This is a Phase II study, meaning it is designed to assess safety and preliminary efficacy, not to definitively prove benefit. The abstract provides no information on patient numbers or specific outcomes. The study focuses on a different NET subtype (SCNEC) than the patient’s small bowel NET, further limiting the strength of the evidence. Full publication review is essential for a complete assessment.

29. Decrease in tumor content assessed in biopsies is associated with improved treatment outcome response to pembrolizumab in patients with rare tumors.
   PMID: 32303619
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the predictive biomarker potential of tumor content (TC) changes during pembrolizumab treatment in rare tumors, which directly applies to neuroendocrine tumors (NET) given their classification as rare cancers. Identifying biomarkers to predict response to immunotherapy like pembrolizumab is crucial for personalized NET treatment, particularly when conventional therapies are failing or limited. The study suggests that assessing TC changes *during* treatment, not just after neoadjuvant therapy, could be valuable.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   A decrease in tumor content (TC) assessed in biopsies taken *during* pembrolizumab treatment is associated with improved treatment outcome response.
*   The *shift* in TC from baseline to on-treatment is a potentially useful predictor of response, suggesting dynamic assessment is important.
*   The study suggests TC assessment in biopsies can serve as a surrogate marker for treatment efficacy, potentially guiding treatment continuation or modification.
*   This finding supports the idea that early assessment of treatment effect, beyond just initial staging, can inform clinical decision-making.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider a biopsy during pembrolizumab treatment to assess tumor content (TC). A decrease in TC may indicate a positive response and support continued treatment. Conversely, stable or increasing TC may suggest a lack of benefit and prompt consideration of alternative therapies. This should be considered alongside standard radiological assessments.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This finding is relevant for patients with advanced or metastatic NET who are receiving pembrolizumab, particularly those where initial response is unclear or disease is stable but not significantly regressing. It’s most applicable to patients where a biopsy is feasible and safe to obtain during treatment. Patients with progressing disease despite pembrolizumab may also benefit from TC assessment to confirm lack of response.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is derived from a Phase II study (NCT02721732) investigating pembrolizumab in rare tumors. While the study provides valuable exploratory data, Phase II studies are generally hypothesis-generating and have limited patient numbers. The specific patient numbers within the NET subset are not detailed in the abstract, limiting the strength of the evidence specifically for NET patients. Further validation in larger, prospective studies specifically focused on NET is needed.

30. Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced rare cancers.
   PMID: 32188704
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the use of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, in advanced rare cancers, which directly includes neuroendocrine tumors (NET) as a potential candidate given their relative rarity. While not NET-specific, the study’s investigation of immunotherapy in challenging-to-treat cancers is highly relevant for this patient with progressing metastatic disease despite somatostatin analog therapy. The study offers a potential avenue for treatment consideration when standard options are exhausted.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated activity in a cohort of patients with advanced rare cancers, suggesting potential benefit beyond traditional treatment modalities.
* The study supports the hypothesis that immunotherapy can be effective across a broad range of cancer types, including those traditionally considered less immunogenic.
* While overall response rates weren’t specified in the abstract, the study’s design aimed to assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of pembrolizumab in this challenging patient population.
* The study highlights the need for exploring novel therapeutic strategies for rare cancers where treatment options are limited.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analog therapy (stable disease initially, now suspected progression), pembrolizumab should be *considered* as a potential treatment option. Further investigation of PD-L1 expression in the patient’s tumor tissue would be beneficial to assess potential responsiveness, although PD-L1 status isn’t necessarily predictive of response in all cancers. A multidisciplinary tumor board discussion is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, metastatic NET who have progressed on or are ineligible for standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, targeted therapies like sunitinib/everolimus). Patients with a good performance status are generally better candidates for immunotherapy. The patient described (NET of the small intestine with liver metastases, progressing after initial resection and somatostatin analog therapy) falls within this population.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate. This is a Phase 2 study (NCT02721732), meaning it’s designed to assess the activity and safety of pembrolizumab, not to confirm efficacy. The abstract doesn’t provide patient numbers or specific response rates. Further data from the full publication and ideally, results from larger Phase 3 trials, are needed to establish definitive efficacy and optimal patient selection criteria.

31. Phase II clinical trial of pembrolizumab efficacy and safety in advanced adrenocortical carcinoma.
   PMID: 31533818
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2019
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, while focused on adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), is potentially relevant to NET treatment due to the investigation of pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Both ACC and NETs are rare cancers with limited treatment options, and both may exhibit sensitivity to immunotherapy. Exploring efficacy in ACC could provide rationale for investigating pembrolizumab in specific NET subtypes, particularly those with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or high tumor mutational burden (TMB).

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in patients with *metastatic* ACC, a disease with limited treatment options.
* While the abstract doesn’t detail specific response rates, it indicates an investigation into pembrolizumab’s potential benefit.
* The study assessed both efficacy *and* safety, crucial for any new treatment consideration.
* ACC is a rare malignancy, highlighting the need for exploring novel therapies like immunotherapy.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, considering pembrolizumab as a potential treatment option for the patient with progressing small bowel NET and liver metastases *should be explored*, particularly after failure of somatostatin analogs. However, prior to initiating treatment, biomarker analysis for mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) is *strongly recommended* as these predictive biomarkers are increasingly important for immunotherapy response.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant to patients with *advanced* or *metastatic* NETs who have progressed on standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs). Patients with dMMR or high TMB within the NET population are most likely to benefit, based on current immunotherapy understanding. The patient in question, with progressing liver metastases despite somatostatin analog treatment, falls into this category and warrants further investigation.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate. This is a Phase II clinical trial, meaning it’s designed to assess efficacy and safety in a limited number of patients. The abstract provides limited details regarding patient numbers and specific response rates. Further investigation of larger, randomized Phase III trials is needed to confirm these findings and establish pembrolizumab as a standard treatment option for NETs.

32. [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus long-acting octreotide versus high&#x2011;dose long-acting octreotide for the treatment of newly diagnosed, advanced grade 2-3, well-differentiated, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETTER-2): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study.
   PMID: 38851203
   Study: Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET (NCT03972488)
   Publication Date: 2024
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses a critical unmet need in the treatment of advanced, well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), specifically grade 2 and 3. The study investigates a potential first-line therapy option, which is highly relevant given the patient’s progression despite initial surgery and somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus long-acting octreotide (LAR) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to high-dose LAR octreotide alone in patients with advanced GEP-NETs.
*   The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the objective response rate (ORR) with the addition of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE.
*   The safety profile of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus LAR octreotide was manageable, with the most common adverse events being hematological toxicities.
*   The study establishes [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE as a potential new standard of care for first-line treatment of this patient population.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the NETTER-2 study results, consideration should be given to initiating treatment with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in combination with long-acting octreotide for patients with newly diagnosed, advanced grade 2-3, well-differentiated GEP-NETs. Given the patient’s current progression on somatostatin analogs, switching to this regimen should be discussed.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with newly diagnosed, advanced (metastatic) grade 2 or 3, well-differentiated GEP-NETs. The patient’s history of a grade 1 small bowel NET with subsequent metastatic disease to the liver makes them a candidate for consideration, particularly given the progression despite initial treatment. Somatostatin receptor positivity is a prerequisite for [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE treatment.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized controlled trial (NCT03972488). While open-label introduces potential bias, the Phase 3 designation and randomized design provide strong evidence. The study’s abstract does not specify the exact patient numbers, but Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of participants, increasing the reliability of the findings.

33. State of the art and future directions in the systemic treatment of neuroendocrine neoplasms.
   PMID: 33973550
   Study: Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET (NCT03972488)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication provides a broad overview of systemic treatment options for neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), which is directly relevant to the clinical question of further therapy for this patient with progressive disease despite somatostatin analog treatment. It contextualizes treatment decisions based on various prognostic factors and acknowledges the limited robust data available, highlighting the need for considering all available options.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   The treatment of advanced NENs relies on a complex assessment of multiple factors including tumor location, grade, hormone secretion, tumor burden, growth rate, and receptor expression.
*   The abstract emphasizes the limited robust data supporting systemic treatment strategies for NENs, suggesting a need for individualized approaches.
*   Somatostatin receptor expression is highlighted as a key factor influencing treatment response, implicitly supporting the continued use of somatostatin analogs (like the patient is currently receiving) or therapies targeting the somatostatin receptor.
*   The abstract doesn’t detail specific therapies beyond acknowledging the need for systemic treatment, but sets the stage for considering newer options.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   While the abstract itself doesn’t provide *specific* recommendations, it supports a comprehensive evaluation for potential therapies beyond somatostatin analogs, particularly given the patient’s progression despite current treatment. Considering the NCT ID provided (NCT03972488 – Lutathera trial), and the patient’s history of stable disease on somatostatin analogs, **Lutetium-177 Dotatate (Lutathera)** should be strongly considered as a next-line therapy, *especially* if somatostatin receptor expression is confirmed. Further investigation into the patient’s receptor status is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* GEP-NETs (like this patient with liver metastases) who have progressed on or are intolerant to first-line somatostatin analog therapy. The NCT ID specifically targets Grade 2 and 3 tumors, making this patient (with a G1 tumor) potentially less ideal, but still potentially eligible depending on disease burden and progression.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The abstract references the broader landscape of NEN treatment, acknowledging limited robust data. The linked NCT ID refers to a Phase 3 clinical trial (NETTER-1), which provides relatively strong evidence for Lutathera’s efficacy and safety in *selected* patients with advanced GEP-NETs. However, the abstract itself doesn’t provide specific data on patient numbers or outcomes.

34. Markers of Systemic Inflammation in Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Pooled Analysis of the RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-4 Studies.
   PMID: 33560090
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the role of systemic inflammation, measured by NLR and LMR, as potential biomarkers for predicting response to everolimus in NET patients. Understanding these biomarkers could help personalize treatment decisions and potentially identify patients most likely to benefit from everolimus therapy, making it relevant for treatment planning. While not directly recommending a therapy *change*, it informs how we might *select* patients for existing therapies.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study analyzed pooled data from the RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-4 trials, investigating the correlation between baseline inflammatory markers (NLR and LMR) and outcomes in NET patients treated with everolimus or placebo.
* Higher baseline NLR was associated with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with everolimus.
* Lower baseline LMR was also associated with poorer PFS in patients treated with everolimus.
* These findings suggest that pre-treatment inflammatory status may predict response to everolimus, potentially identifying a subgroup of patients who may not benefit as much.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on these findings, consider assessing baseline NLR and LMR in patients with advanced NET being considered for everolimus therapy. Patients with elevated NLR and/or decreased LMR may have a lower likelihood of response to everolimus and should be considered for alternative treatment strategies or closer monitoring. Further investigation into alternative therapies or combination approaches for this subgroup may be warranted.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* neuroendocrine tumors (GI or lung origin) who are candidates for systemic therapy, specifically everolimus. The study focuses on patients with progressive disease despite prior treatment, similar to the current patient’s situation with suspected progression after initial resection and somatostatin analogue therapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively strong, stemming from a *Phase III* pooled analysis of two large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-4 – NCT01524783). The study likely included a substantial number of patients (details of patient numbers within the pooled analysis would be found in the full publication). However, it’s a *retrospective* biomarker analysis within these trials, meaning the trials weren’t *designed* to specifically test this biomarker relationship. Therefore, while suggestive, these findings require prospective validation.

35. Impact of prior therapies on everolimus activity: an exploratory analysis of RADIANT-4.
   PMID: 29081664
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses treatment options for advanced NET patients, specifically evaluating the impact of prior therapies on the efficacy of everolimus. Given the patient’s progression despite somatostatin analog (SSA) therapy and suspected disease progression, understanding everolimus’ activity in this context is highly relevant for treatment decision-making. The study provides valuable insights into whether prior SSA exposure influences the benefit derived from everolimus.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The RADIANT-4 study demonstrated a significant improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) with everolimus compared to placebo in advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional NETs (HR 0.48).
* This exploratory analysis specifically investigates how prior treatments – SSAs, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy – affect everolimus’ efficacy. (The abstract doesn't detail *how* they affect it, only that it *investigates* it).
* The study focuses on both gastrointestinal (GI) and lung NETs, making it applicable to the patient’s small bowel NET.
* While the abstract doesn't provide specific results regarding prior SSA impact, it highlights the importance of considering prior treatment history when evaluating everolimus as a therapeutic option.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s prior treatment with somatostatin analogs (Somatoline) and suspected progression, everolimus should be strongly considered as a next-line therapy. The RADIANT-4 study supports its use in patients with progressive disease despite prior treatments. Further investigation of the full RADIANT-4 publication is needed to understand the specific impact of prior SSA use on everolimus response.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional NETs of either gastrointestinal or lung origin. The patient’s history of a well-differentiated (G1) small bowel NET with metastatic disease fits this profile. Patients who have progressed on or are intolerant to somatostatin analogs are prime candidates for consideration.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, originating from a Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RADIANT-4). The abstract refers to a post-hoc analysis, which is exploratory in nature, but is based on data from a robust Phase III study. The original RADIANT-4 study included a substantial number of patients, providing statistical power. However, this specific analysis is exploratory and further details are needed to fully assess the impact of prior therapies.

36. Everolimus in advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine tumors: RADIANT-4 lung subgroup analysis.
   PMID: 29055056
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2018
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication provides strong evidence supporting the use of everolimus in advanced, progressive, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. While the study focuses on a lung NET subgroup, the primary RADIANT-4 trial included gastrointestinal NETs, making the findings potentially relevant for this patient, particularly given progression despite somatostatin analogs.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Everolimus significantly improved median progression-free survival (PFS) by 5.6 months in the lung NET subgroup compared to placebo (9.2 vs 3.6 months).
* A higher proportion of patients receiving everolimus experienced tumor shrinkage (58%) compared to placebo (13%).
* The hazard ratio for PFS was 0.50, indicating a substantial reduction in the risk of disease progression with everolimus.
* Common grade 3-4 adverse events included stomatitis, hyperglycemia, and infections, requiring monitoring and management.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider adding everolimus to best supportive care for this patient, given the documented progression of disease despite somatostatin analog therapy. Everolimus should be discussed as a potential systemic therapy option to delay disease progression.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with advanced (metastatic), progressive, well-differentiated (Grade 1 or 2) non-functional neuroendocrine tumors, originating from either the lung or gastrointestinal tract. The patient’s history of well-differentiated (G1) NET with liver metastases and progression despite somatostatin analogs fits this profile.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, derived from a Phase III, randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-4) with a subgroup analysis of 90 lung NET patients (63 everolimus, 27 placebo). The study utilized central radiology review for PFS assessment, enhancing objectivity. The overall RADIANT-4 trial included 302 patients, providing a robust dataset.

37. Health-related quality of life for everolimus versus placebo in patients with advanced, non-functional, well-differentiated gastrointestinal or lung neuroendocrine tumours (RADIANT-4): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.
   PMID: 28838862
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the therapeutic management of advanced NETs, specifically focusing on quality of life outcomes with everolimus treatment. Given the patient’s progression despite somatostatin analogs and the presence of liver metastases, exploring systemic therapies like everolimus is highly relevant. The study provides valuable data supporting the use of everolimus in improving progression-free survival and, importantly, maintaining quality of life.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Everolimus demonstrated increased progression-free survival compared to placebo in patients with advanced, progressive, non-functional, well-differentiated NETs.
* The study focused on HRQOL as a secondary endpoint, demonstrating that everolimus did not negatively impact, and potentially improved, patient-reported outcomes.
* The RADIANT-4 trial included both gastrointestinal and lung NETs, broadening the applicability of the findings.
* The study confirms the benefit of everolimus even in patients with well-differentiated tumors, which is relevant given the patient’s G1 designation.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider adding everolimus to best supportive care for this patient, given the evidence of progression despite somatostatin analogs. The study supports that this may prolong progression-free survival without significantly compromising quality of life. A discussion with the patient regarding potential side effects and benefits is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, *progressive*, *non-functional*, and *well-differentiated* gastrointestinal or lung NETs. The patient’s history of progressing liver metastases despite initial resection and somatostatin analog therapy aligns with this population. While the patient’s tumor is G1 (well-differentiated), the study included patients with varying degrees of differentiation within the well-differentiated category.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, originating from a Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RADIANT-4 - NCT01524783). While the exact patient numbers are not provided in the abstract, Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of participants, providing robust statistical power. The focus on HRQOL as a secondary endpoint adds further value to the study.

   PMID: 26703889
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2016
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NET), specifically those of gastrointestinal origin, making it highly relevant to the presented patient case. The study investigates a systemic therapy option for progressive disease, a situation the patient is currently facing with suspected progression on somatostatin analogs. The findings could inform decisions regarding second-line systemic treatment.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Everolimus significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced, non-functional NET.
* The study demonstrated a hazard ratio for disease progression of 0.47 (95% CI 0.35-0.63) favoring everolimus.
* Overall survival (OS) also showed a trend towards improvement with everolimus, although this did not reach statistical significance.
* Common adverse events associated with everolimus included stomatitis, fatigue, diarrhea, and infections.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the RADIANT-4 study, consideration should be given to adding everolimus to best supportive care for this patient, given the evidence of improved PFS. Given the patient’s history of surgical resection and current stable disease for a period on somatostatin analogs, this represents a potential next step in systemic therapy if the suspected progression is confirmed. A discussion of potential side effects is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, *non-functional* NET of either gastrointestinal or lung origin who have experienced disease progression despite initial therapies (in this case, somatostatin analogs). The patient’s G1 NET of the small intestine with liver metastases fits this profile, assuming it remains non-functional.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This study is a Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (NCT01524783, PMID: 26703889). While the exact patient numbers aren’t provided in the abstract, Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of participants, providing strong evidence for efficacy and safety. The statistically significant improvement in PFS strengthens the evidence base, although the lack of statistically significant OS improvement should be acknowledged.

39. Bempegaldesleukin plus Nivolumab in First-line Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma: Results from PIVOT-02.
   PMID: 35643589
   Study: A Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of NKTR-214 in Combination With Nivolumab and Other Anti-Cancer Therapies in Patients With Select Advanced Solid Tumors (NCT02983045)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, focusing on urothelial carcinoma, has *limited* direct relevance to the treatment of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NET). However, the study investigates a novel immunotherapy combination (bempegaldesleukin + nivolumab) which is being explored in various solid tumors, including NETs (as evidenced by NCT02983045). Therefore, understanding the efficacy and safety profile of this combination in other cancers can inform potential application in NET treatment, particularly in cases progressing despite somatostatin analogs.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study demonstrates that bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab shows promising activity in first-line metastatic urothelial carcinoma, particularly in cisplatin-ineligible patients.
* The combination aims to overcome resistance to PD-1 blockade by enhancing T-cell activation and infiltration into the tumor microenvironment.
* While not detailed in the abstract, the full publication (PIVOT-02) likely provides data on response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival.
* The therapy is presented as a potential chemotherapy-free alternative, addressing a need for better tolerated treatments.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this publication *alone*, no direct therapy recommendations can be made for the patient’s small intestinal NET. However, considering the patient’s progression despite somatostatin analogs and the ongoing NCT02983045 study, enrollment in a clinical trial evaluating NKTR-214 (bempegaldesleukin’s active component) in combination with nivolumab (and potentially ipilimumab) should be considered. This is particularly relevant given the patient’s metastatic disease and potential for limited benefit from further conventional therapies.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings from the urothelial carcinoma study suggest potential benefit in patients with advanced solid tumors, including NET, who have progressed on standard therapies. Specifically, patients with progressive disease despite somatostatin analog treatment, and who are candidates for immunotherapy, might be considered for trials investigating this combination. The original NCT study (NCT02983045) will define more specific inclusion/exclusion criteria.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented here is from a Phase 1/2 study (PIVOT-02) in urothelial carcinoma. While promising, the data are not definitive. The NCT02983045 study is also a Phase 1 study, meaning the data are preliminary and focused on safety and dose escalation. Larger, randomized Phase 2 or 3 trials are needed to confirm efficacy and establish this combination as a standard treatment for any solid tumor, including NET.

40. Bempegaldesleukin Plus Nivolumab in First-Line Metastatic Melanoma.
   PMID: 34255535
   Study: A Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of NKTR-214 in Combination With Nivolumab and Other Anti-Cancer Therapies in Patients With Select Advanced Solid Tumors (NCT02983045)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, focusing on bempegaldesleukin (BEMPEG) plus nivolumab in metastatic melanoma, has *potential* relevance to NET treatment due to the investigation of immune checkpoint inhibition (nivolumab) and immune modulation (BEMPEG). While NETs are not melanoma, emerging evidence suggests immunotherapy can be effective in a subset of NET patients, and combinations aiming to enhance immune response are being explored. However, direct extrapolation requires caution as NET biology differs significantly from melanoma.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   BEMPEG + nivolumab demonstrated activity in first-line metastatic melanoma.
*   The combination aims to enhance anti-tumor immunity by activating the CD122-preferential interleukin-2 pathway.
*   The study suggests potential for deeper and more durable responses compared to standard therapies in melanoma.
*   The study is a Phase II cohort of a larger, international PIVOT-02 study.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressing disease despite somatostatin analogs and prior surgical resection, exploring immunotherapy combinations *could* be considered, but within the context of clinical trials. Given the limited data in NETs, this combination (BEMPEG + nivolumab) is not a standard recommendation and should only be pursued if available in a clinical trial setting. The NCT02983045 trial (NKTR-214, a similar immunostimulatory agent, with nivolumab) might be a relevant trial to investigate, although it also includes ipilimumab and other solid tumors.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy *might* be considered for patients with progressive, metastatic NET who have exhausted other treatment options (surgery, somatostatin analogs, potentially PRRT). Patients with good performance status and no significant autoimmune comorbidities are more likely to benefit. Biomarkers predicting response to immunotherapy in NETs (e.g., PD-L1 expression, tumor mutational burden) are still under investigation, but should ideally be assessed.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently moderate. This is a Phase II study in melanoma, not NET. While the combination shows promise in melanoma, efficacy and safety in NETs are unknown. The PIVOT-02 study provides some initial data, but larger, randomized controlled trials specifically in NET patients are needed to establish the role of BEMPEG + nivolumab. The NCT02983045 trial, while investigating a similar immunostimulatory agent, is a Phase I study and therefore provides preliminary safety and dose-finding data.

41. Mobilization of pre-existing polyclonal T cells specific to neoantigens but not self-antigens during treatment of a patient with melanoma with bempegaldesleukin and nivolumab.
   PMID: 33298619
   Study: A Dose Escalation and Cohort Expansion Study of NKTR-214 in Combination With Nivolumab and Other Anti-Cancer Therapies in Patients With Select Advanced Solid Tumors (NCT02983045)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, while focused on melanoma, provides insights into the potential of combining NKTR-214 (bempegaldesleukin) with nivolumab to enhance anti-tumor T cell responses. Given that NETs can exhibit immune evasion and may respond to immunotherapy, understanding mechanisms to boost T cell activity is potentially relevant, although direct extrapolation to NETs requires caution. The study highlights a potential pathway to improve immunotherapy efficacy by mobilizing pre-existing neoantigen-specific T cells.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Combination of NKTR-214 and nivolumab led to a durable clinical response in a melanoma patient.
* Pre-existing, polyclonal T cells specific to neoantigens were enriched within the tumor microenvironment prior to treatment and expanded during successful therapy.
* Neoantigen-specific T cell responses, rather than self-antigen responses, appear to be the primary driver of anti-tumor immunity in this context.
* NKTR-214 appears to mobilize these pre-existing T cells, enhancing their ability to infiltrate the tumor and mediate rejection.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on these findings, exploring the combination of NKTR-214 and nivolumab in carefully selected NET patients with progressive disease despite standard therapies (like somatostatin analogs) could be considered within a clinical trial setting. Investigating the presence of neoantigens in the patient’s NET and assessing pre-existing neoantigen-specific T cell responses might help identify patients most likely to benefit. Further research is needed to determine if NETs share similar immunological characteristics to the melanoma case studied.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This approach may be most relevant for NET patients who: 1) have progressed on somatostatin analog therapy; 2) have tumors with a high mutational burden potentially leading to neoantigen presentation; 3) have evidence of T cell infiltration into the tumor; and 4) have adequate performance status to tolerate immunotherapy. Patients with well-differentiated, slowly progressing NETs are less likely to benefit.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is very preliminary. This is a Phase 1 study reporting on a single patient case. While the findings are intriguing, they are based on limited data and cannot be generalized to the broader NET population. Further investigation in larger cohorts and dedicated NET clinical trials is crucial to determine the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy.

Publications Summarized: 27

1. Angiogenesis inhibitors in neuroendocrine tumours: finally coming of age.
   PMID: 33152282
   Study: Testing Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine and Carcinoid Tumors (NCT03375320)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication discusses the role of angiogenesis inhibitors, specifically cabozantinib, in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Given the patient’s diagnosis of a high-grade (G3) small bowel NET with liver metastases, and the potential for aggressive behavior indicated by the high Ki67 (48%), exploring angiogenesis inhibition is highly relevant as a potential systemic therapy option post-surgery. The study directly investigates cabozantinib in advanced NETs, making it directly applicable to this clinical question.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The publication suggests angiogenesis inhibitors are “coming of age” as a therapeutic option for NETs, indicating increasing evidence for their efficacy.
* Cabozantinib is specifically highlighted as an angiogenesis inhibitor being investigated in NETs.
* Angiogenesis inhibitors target the tumor microenvironment, potentially slowing tumor growth and progression by inhibiting blood vessel formation.
* The study (NCT03375320) is actively testing cabozantinib in advanced pancreatic and carcinoid NETs, suggesting a focus on more aggressive disease.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider cabozantinib as a potential systemic therapy option for this patient, particularly given the high-grade nature of the tumor and presence of liver metastases. The study NCT03375320 is evaluating cabozantinib versus placebo, and results from this trial could directly inform treatment decisions. Further investigation of the full study results is crucial before initiating treatment.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* NETs, specifically those with progressive disease or high-risk features (like high Ki67, high tumor grade, and metastatic disease). This patient, with a G3 tumor and liver metastases, falls within this population. Patients who have failed other lines of therapy (e.g., somatostatin analogs) may also be suitable candidates.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The study is a Phase III clinical trial (NCT03375320), indicating a relatively high level of evidence. However, the abstract provided is limited, and details regarding patient numbers, primary endpoints, and specific results are unavailable. The strength of the evidence will depend on the full study results and statistical significance of the findings.

2. Abstracts Presented at the 13th Annual Multidisciplinary Neuroendocrine Tumor Medical Virtual Symposium of the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society, October 2-3, 2020.
   PMID: 33835977
   Study: Liposomal Irinotecan, Fluorouracil and Leucovorin in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced High Grade Neuroendocrine Cancer of Gastrointestinal, Unknown, or Pancreatic Origin (NCT03736720)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase II study investigating a chemotherapy regimen for advanced, refractory high-grade neuroendocrine cancer. Given the patient’s diagnosis of a high-grade (G3, Ki67 48%) small bowel NET with lymph node and liver metastases, and the completion of surgical resection, this study is potentially relevant for consideration as a subsequent therapy option if disease progression occurs. The focus on refractory disease suggests it’s intended for situations where initial treatments have failed.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study investigates a combination of liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin.
* The study focuses on patients with *refractory* advanced high-grade NETs, meaning prior therapies have not been effective.
* The study includes quality-of-life assessments alongside clinical response, indicating a holistic approach to evaluating treatment benefit.
* The abstract itself provides no specific efficacy data, only outlining the study design.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study explores the combination of liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin as a potential treatment option for advanced, refractory high-grade NET. While the abstract doesn’t provide results, the regimen *could* be considered in the patient’s case *if* the disease progresses after initial surgery and any subsequent somatostatin analog or targeted therapies (e.g., PRRT) are ineffective. Further investigation of the full study results is crucial before implementation.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy is most relevant for patients with:
* Advanced (metastatic) high-grade (G3) neuroendocrine tumors of gastrointestinal, unknown, or pancreatic origin.
* Disease that is *refractory* to prior treatments.
* Adequate performance status to tolerate chemotherapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited. This is a Phase II study (NCT03736720), which primarily assesses safety and preliminary efficacy. The abstract itself provides no data on patient numbers, response rates, or toxicity. Therefore, the evidence is considered preliminary and requires confirmation from larger, Phase III trials. The full study publication needs to be reviewed for detailed results.

3. Efficacy and safety of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin in relapsed small cell lung cancer. Results from an expansion cohort of a phase I study.
   PMID: 33704620
   Study: Study Escalating Doses of PM01183 in Combination With Fixed Doxorubicin in Patients With Specific Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors (NCT01970540)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase I study evaluating lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin, originally in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). While the study focuses on SCLC, lurbinectedin has demonstrated activity in other cancers, including some NETs, by inducing DNA damage and disrupting cell cycle control. Therefore, exploring its potential benefit in advanced NETs, particularly those with limited treatment options, is warranted, though direct extrapolation from SCLC data requires caution.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The combination of doxorubicin and lurbinectedin showed a 36% overall response rate (ORR) in relapsed SCLC patients.
* Patients with sensitive disease (longer chemotherapy-free interval) had a significantly higher ORR (50%) and improved PFS/OS compared to those with resistant disease.
* The primary toxicity observed was manageable myelosuppression, with mostly mild to moderate non-hematological side effects.
* The studied dose of doxorubicin (40mg/m2) and lurbinectedin (2.0mg/m2) every 3 weeks appeared to be well-tolerated and demonstrated activity.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s G3 NET with liver and lymph node metastases after surgical resection, lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin *could* be considered as a potential treatment option, particularly if other standard therapies (e.g., somatostatin analogs, mTOR inhibitors, chemotherapy with streptozocin-based regimens) have failed or are not suitable. However, this should be within the context of a clinical trial or with careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks. Further investigation into the efficacy of this combination specifically in NETs is needed.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This combination might be most relevant for patients with advanced, unresectable, progressive NETs who have relapsed after prior therapy or have limited treatment options. Patients with a good performance status and adequate bone marrow reserve are likely to be better candidates, given the myelosuppressive effects. The study suggests a potential benefit in patients with less aggressive disease (analogous to “sensitive disease” in SCLC, potentially correlating with lower Ki-67), but this needs further investigation in NETs.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to a Phase I study with an expansion cohort (n=28) in SCLC. While the results are promising, they are preliminary and cannot be directly applied to NET patients. The study provides initial safety and efficacy data, but a randomized Phase III trial is ongoing in SCLC to confirm these findings. Further research, ideally a clinical trial specifically designed for NET patients, is necessary to establish the efficacy and safety of this combination in this population.

4. Phase I Study of Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 Inhibitor, CC-90011, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
   PMID: 33046517
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor, as a potential therapy for advanced solid tumors, which *could* be relevant for the presented NET patient given the aggressive nature (G3, high Ki-67) and metastatic disease. LSD1’s role in chemoresistance suggests a potential benefit in overcoming treatment resistance, a common challenge in advanced NETs. However, direct evidence for NET efficacy is currently lacking.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * CC-90011 is a potent, selective, and reversible oral LSD1 inhibitor.
* LSD1 expression is linked to cancer stem cells and chemoresistance in various tumor types.
* The study investigated CC-90011 in both solid tumors *and* relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, broadening potential applicability.
* The study is a Phase I trial, primarily focused on safety and dose escalation, with preliminary efficacy signals.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this Phase I study, CC-90011 *could* be considered within a clinical trial setting for this patient, given the aggressive features of the NET (high Ki-67 48%, metastatic disease) and after surgical resection. It is *not* a standard-of-care treatment and should only be pursued if other standard therapies have failed or are not suitable. Further investigation into NET-specific efficacy is needed.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with advanced solid tumors, including potentially aggressive NET subtypes, who have relapsed after or are refractory to standard therapies. Patients with high Ki-67 proliferation indices, suggesting a more aggressive disease course, might be more likely to benefit, based on the rationale of targeting chemoresistance.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is very preliminary. This is a Phase I study, meaning the primary focus is on safety and determining a tolerable dose. Patient numbers are likely small, and efficacy data are limited. The study provides a rationale for further investigation but does not offer definitive proof of efficacy in any tumor type, including NETs.
----------------------------------------

5. Clinical activity of CC-90011, an oral, potent, and reversible LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies.
   PMID: 35737639
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the Phase 1 study of CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies, including some hematological cancers. While not specifically focused on NETs, LSD1 inhibition is a potential therapeutic strategy being explored in various cancers, including some preclinical NET models, making this publication potentially relevant for consideration in heavily pre-treated or refractory cases. The study’s findings warrant further investigation into the role of LSD1 inhibition in NET treatment.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * CC-90011 demonstrates clinical activity in advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma.
* The drug is orally bioavailable, potent, selective, and reversible, suggesting a potentially manageable safety profile.
* The study reports long-term safety and efficacy data, indicating tolerability.
* Novel pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were collected, providing insights into drug behavior and mechanism of action.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this Phase 1 study, CC-90011 *could* be considered within a clinical trial setting for patients with advanced NETs who have exhausted standard treatment options. Given the patient’s G3 NET with high Ki-67 (48%) and metastatic disease, exploring novel agents like CC-90011 is reasonable if other therapies have failed. However, it is crucial to emphasize this is *not* standard of care and should only be pursued within a research context.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced solid tumors, including potentially aggressive NETs, who have relapsed after or are refractory to standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy, targeted therapies). Patients with high tumor burden and limited treatment options might benefit most from exploring this agent.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently *low*. This is a Phase 1 study, primarily designed to assess safety and determine a recommended dose. While encouraging activity was observed, the patient numbers are likely small, and efficacy data are preliminary. Further investigation in Phase 2 and 3 trials specifically focused on NETs is required to establish the true therapeutic potential of CC-90011.

6. Dual inactivation of Akt and ERK by TIC10 signals Foxo3a nuclear translocation, TRAIL gene induction, and potent antitumor effects.
   PMID: 23390247
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2013
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the preclinical mechanism of action of TIC10, a small molecule inducing TRAIL expression, which could potentially be relevant for NET therapy as TRAIL-based therapies aim to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. While NETs can exhibit variable sensitivity to apoptosis induction, exploring agents that enhance endogenous TRAIL expression represents a novel therapeutic avenue. The study’s focus on overcoming limitations of recombinant TRAIL (stability, biodistribution) is particularly pertinent.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * TIC10 is an orally active small molecule that induces TRAIL expression in both tumor and normal cells, independent of p53 status.
* TIC10’s mechanism involves dual inactivation of Akt and ERK kinases, leading to Foxo3a nuclear translocation and subsequent upregulation of the TRAIL gene.
* TIC10 demonstrates antitumor activity by enhancing endogenous TRAIL concentrations, impacting both tumor cells and their microenvironment.
* The compound crosses the blood-brain barrier, suggesting potential for treating brain metastases, a common occurrence in some NET subtypes.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   TIC10, or similar compounds targeting the Akt/ERK pathway to induce TRAIL expression, should be considered for investigation in clinical trials for NET patients, particularly those with limited treatment options or those with brain metastases. Combination therapies with existing NET treatments (e.g., somatostatin analogs, mTOR inhibitors) to potentially synergistically enhance TRAIL sensitivity could also be explored.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This approach may be most relevant for patients with NETs that exhibit low baseline TRAIL expression or resistance to conventional therapies. Patients with aggressive, high-grade NETs (like the G3 Ki67 48% case presented) might benefit, as these tumors often demonstrate increased signaling through the Akt/ERK pathways. Further investigation is needed to identify predictive biomarkers for TIC10 response within the NET patient population.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented is preclinical, based on *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies. The cited PMID (23390247) refers to the mechanistic study of TIC10, not the NCT03034200 trial. The NCT03034200 trial (Phase 2) is the clinical study evaluating ONC201 (TIC10), and its results are needed to determine clinical efficacy and safety. Therefore, the evidence is currently low-level and requires confirmation through ongoing and future clinical trials.
----------------------------------------

7. Identification of TRAIL-inducing compounds highlights small molecule ONC201/TIC10 as a unique anti-cancer agent that activates the TRAIL pathway.
   PMID: 25927855
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2015
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the mechanism of action of ONC201/TIC10, a small molecule inducing TRAIL expression, which may be relevant for NET treatment as TRAIL pathway activation can induce apoptosis in cancer cells. While the study doesn’t specifically focus on NETs, the potential to overcome resistance mechanisms and enhance TRAIL-mediated cell death warrants investigation in this patient population, particularly given the aggressive nature of the patient’s G3 NET.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * ONC201/TIC10 is a small molecule that induces the expression of the TRAIL gene.
* The induced TRAIL expression improves the efficacy of TRAIL as an anti-cancer agent.
* ONC201/TIC10 has demonstrated promising safety and antitumor efficacy in preclinical models.
* The mechanism of action centers around activating the TRAIL pathway, potentially overcoming resistance to other therapies.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s high-grade (G3) NET with lymph node and liver metastases, and following surgical resection, ONC201/TIC10 should be considered within the context of a clinical trial (as indicated by NCT03034200). Further investigation into its efficacy in combination with standard-of-care treatments (e.g., somatostatin analogs, mTOR inhibitors, chemotherapy) is warranted. The study suggests potential benefit in cases where other therapies have failed or are not fully effective.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy may be most relevant for patients with advanced, aggressive NETs (like G3 with high Ki-67 proliferation index, as in this case) that have progressed despite initial treatment or for whom standard therapies are not suitable. Patients with tumors exhibiting resistance to conventional therapies might also benefit.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented is preliminary, stemming from a Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03034200) and preclinical studies. The publication focuses on the mechanism of action and early clinical testing. While promising, the evidence is not conclusive, and larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of ONC201/TIC10 in NET patients. The PMID 25927855 refers to an earlier publication detailing the mechanism, not the Phase 2 trial results themselves.
----------------------------------------

8. Genetic and Pharmacological Screens Converge in Identifying FLIP, BCL2, and IAP Proteins as Key Regulators of Sensitivity to the TRAIL-Inducing Anticancer Agent ONC201/TIC10.
   PMID: 25681273
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2015
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the mechanism of action and potential synergistic effects of ONC201, a TRAIL-inducing agent, in cancer treatment. While the study doesn’t specifically focus on neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), the identified pathways regulating ONC201 sensitivity and synergy with sorafenib could be relevant given the often aggressive nature of high-grade NETs and potential for resistance to standard therapies. Investigating ONC201’s efficacy in NETs, particularly in combination strategies, warrants consideration.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 induces TRAIL expression, leading to cancer cell death. Sensitivity to ONC201 is regulated by FLIP, BCL2, and IAP family proteins.
*   ONC201 demonstrates synergistic effects when combined with sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, leading to increased TRAIL and DR5 expression and enhanced cell death.
*   In a hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model, the combination of ONC201 and sorafenib resulted in tumor regressions without significant toxicity.
*   KSR1 silencing impacts ONC201 sensitivity by reducing anti-apoptotic protein expression, suggesting a potential biomarker role.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on these findings, exploring a combination therapy of ONC201 and sorafenib could be considered for patients with advanced NETs, particularly those who have progressed on standard treatments. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dosing and schedule for this combination. Biomarker analysis for FLIP, BCL2, and IAP protein expression could potentially identify patients most likely to respond to ONC201.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings suggest potential benefit in patients with advanced, aggressive NETs (like the G3, high Ki-67 case presented) who have limited treatment options or have demonstrated resistance to conventional therapies. Patients with tumors expressing high levels of anti-apoptotic proteins (FLIP, BCL2, IAP) *might* be more responsive, but this requires validation.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to a Phase 2 study (NCT03034200) and preclinical data from *in vitro* and mouse xenograft models. The study does not include NET patients specifically. While the synergistic effect of ONC201 and sorafenib is promising, further clinical trials, including Phase I/II trials specifically designed for NET patients, are necessary to confirm efficacy and safety. The patient numbers within the cited publication are not specified, limiting assessment of statistical power.

9. Discovery and clinical introduction of first-in-class imipridone ONC201.
   PMID: 27602582
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2016
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the development and early clinical testing of ONC201, a novel imipridone with a unique mechanism of action inducing apoptosis in tumor cells. While not specifically focused on NETs, the broad anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects observed across various cancers suggest potential relevance for aggressive, refractory NETs, particularly given the patient’s high Ki67 proliferation index. Further investigation within NET subtypes is warranted.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 induces apoptosis via a p53-independent mechanism, activating the integrated stress response and upregulating TRAIL.
*   The drug demonstrates anti-proliferative effects on a broad range of tumor cells while sparing normal cells.
*   ONC201 is orally bioavailable with infrequent dosing and appears to be well-tolerated in initial clinical trials.
*   The recommended Phase II dose is 625mg orally every three weeks, based on preclinical efficacy levels.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s aggressive G3 NET with high Ki67 (48%) and metastatic disease, ONC201 could be considered within a clinical trial setting. Given the lack of specific NET data, it should *not* be considered standard of care, but explored as a potential option for patients with disease progression despite standard therapies (e.g., somatostatin analogs, mTOR inhibitors, chemotherapy).

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, aggressive, and refractory solid tumors, including potentially those with NETs that have progressed despite conventional treatments. Patients with high tumor burden and limited treatment options might benefit most. The initial trial included patients with “advanced aggressive refractory solid tumors” suggesting a focus on those with limited other options.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to Phase 2 clinical trials and preclinical studies. The first-in-human trial demonstrated tolerability and established a recommended Phase II dose, but efficacy data is still emerging (NCT03034200). Patient numbers in the initial trial were likely small, and further studies are needed to confirm efficacy and identify predictive biomarkers for response in specific tumor types, including NETs.

10. Efficacy of ONC201 in Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor.
   PMID: 29626752
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2018
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication primarily focuses on Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT), a rare sarcoma, and is of *limited* direct relevance to the presented neuroendocrine tumor (NET) case. However, the study investigates a novel approach to inducing apoptosis via TRAIL receptor activation using ONC201, a mechanism potentially applicable to various cancers, including some NET subtypes, warranting consideration for exploratory investigation. The shared characteristic of metastasis (lymph node and liver) between DSRCT and the patient’s case provides a tangential rationale for review.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201, an agonist of TRAIL receptors, induced apoptosis in DSRCT cells *in vitro*.
*   *In vivo* studies using orthotopic xenograft models demonstrated that ONC201 inhibited DSRCT tumor growth.
*   Tumor growth inhibition correlated with caspase activation, confirming the mechanism of action involves apoptosis.
*   The study highlights the potential of targeting the TRAIL pathway as a therapeutic strategy in cancers with demonstrated TRAIL receptor expression.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, consideration could be given to investigating ONC201 within the context of a clinical trial for the patient, *after* assessing TRAIL receptor (TRAILR1-4) expression levels in the patient’s tumor tissue. This would be an exploratory approach, as the study’s primary focus is not NET. Further investigation into the expression of TRAIL receptors in this specific patient’s G3 NET with high Ki67 (48%) is crucial before considering ONC201.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings *might* be relevant for patients with NETs, particularly those with aggressive subtypes (like G3 with high Ki67) and evidence of metastasis, *if* their tumors demonstrate significant expression of TRAIL receptors. This is a critical prerequisite. Patients who have failed standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy) could be considered for exploratory trials.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak for NET therapy. This is a Phase 2 study conducted in DSRCT, not NET. The study utilizes *in vitro* and *in vivo* (xenograft) models, which may not perfectly translate to human NET biology. The patient numbers are not specified in the abstract, but Phase 2 trials generally involve a limited number of participants. Further research, specifically in NET models and patients, is needed to validate these findings.

11. Cancer stem cell-related gene expression as a potential biomarker of response for first-in-class imipridone ONC201 in solid tumors.
   PMID: 28767654
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the potential of ONC201, a first-in-class imipridone, as a therapy targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs). While the study primarily focuses on colorectal, prostate, and glioblastoma cancers, the underlying principle of targeting CSCs is relevant to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) as CSCs are implicated in metastasis and treatment resistance across various cancers, including NETs. Identifying predictive biomarkers for ONC201 response could be valuable in selecting patients who might benefit from this therapy.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 targets self-renewing CSCs via Akt/ERK inhibition and DR5/TRAIL induction.
*   ONC201 downregulates stem cell pathways like Wnt signaling and modulates genes (ID1, ID2, ID3, ALDH7A1) involved in self-renewal.
*   Basal expression levels of CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3) correlate with ONC201 efficacy across a large panel of cancer cell lines.
*   ONC201’s efficacy is diminished in cells that have developed resistance, suggesting biomarker testing is crucial.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, consideration should be given to assessing CSC-related gene expression (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3) in the patient’s tumor sample *before* initiating ONC201 treatment. High expression of these genes may predict a better response to ONC201. Participation in clinical trials evaluating ONC201 in NETs (like NCT03034200) should be considered, particularly if biomarker analysis is favorable.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced NETs, particularly those with metastatic disease (as in this case with liver metastases) and potentially those exhibiting features of aggressive disease (high Ki67, G3 grade), might benefit from ONC201 if they demonstrate high expression of the identified CSC-related genes. Patients who have progressed on standard therapies could also be considered.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to Phase I/II clinical trials and *in vitro* studies. The study demonstrates proof-of-concept regarding biomarker prediction but requires validation in larger, prospective clinical trials specifically focused on NETs. The analysis of >1000 cancer cell lines provides some correlative strength, but this is not equivalent to clinical evidence. The study does not report specific patient numbers for the biomarker correlation analysis.

12. Defining Moments: Making Time for Virtual Visits and Catalyzing Better Cancer Care.
   PMID: 30907145
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication is largely *irrelevant* to direct NET therapy recommendations. The article focuses on the implementation and benefits of virtual healthcare visits for cancer patients, specifically regarding communication and access to care, not on novel therapeutic interventions or efficacy data for NETs. While improved patient care and communication are important, this study doesn’t address the clinical question of further therapy for the presented NET patient.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Virtual visits can improve access to expert cancer care.
* Virtual visits allow for unrushed, informative consultations with physicians.
* Effective virtual visits require preparation, clear communication during the visit, and thorough documentation in the electronic medical record.
* Virtual visits can enhance the patient and caregiver experience.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   This publication does *not* provide specific treatment recommendations for NETs. It suggests utilizing virtual visits as a supportive care modality to improve communication and follow-up, but does not address surgical, systemic, or locoregional therapies.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The benefits of virtual visits are relevant to *all* cancer patients, including those with NETs, who may benefit from increased access to specialists and more convenient follow-up care. However, it doesn't dictate *which* therapy they should receive.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is a descriptive report of a program implementation at the Cleveland Clinic. It is not a clinical trial evaluating a specific intervention. The evidence is low-level, based on observational experience and process description, and does not provide quantitative data on clinical outcomes. The referenced NCT ID (NCT03034200) is for a Phase 2 study of ONC201 in NETs, but this publication does *not* report on the results of that study.

13. Phase II Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors including Pheochromocytoma-Paraganglioma and Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor.
   PMID: 35022321
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores ONC201, a DRD2 antagonist, in neuroendocrine tumors. While the study includes NETs, the primary focus appears to be on pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma and desmoplastic small round cell tumor, making its direct relevance to the presented small intestinal NET case moderate and requiring careful consideration of the tumor’s DRD2 expression. The potential benefit hinges on whether the patient’s tumor exhibits dopamine-like DRD2 receptor expression.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * ONC201 is a bitopic DRD2 antagonist, meaning it blocks dopamine receptor D2.
* Preclinical activity of ONC201 has been demonstrated in desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT).
* The study suggests DRD2 receptor expression is higher in pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma compared to other cancers, hinting at potential responsiveness in those subtypes.
* The abstract does *not* provide specific efficacy data for NETs included in the study; it only states NETs were *included*.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this publication alone, ONC201 cannot be definitively recommended. However, *assessment of DRD2 receptor expression in the patient’s tumor tissue should be considered*. If high DRD2 expression is confirmed, participation in clinical trials evaluating ONC201 (like NCT03034200) could be explored as a potential treatment option, particularly given the patient’s high Ki67 (48%) indicating a more aggressive tumor.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings *might* be relevant for patients with NETs that demonstrate high expression of the dopamine-like DRD2 receptor. This is particularly important given the patient’s G3 status and presence of lymph node and liver metastases, suggesting a need for systemic therapy. However, the study doesn’t specify which NET subtypes were included or how they responded.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited. This is a Phase II study (NCT03034200), meaning it is designed to assess safety and preliminary efficacy. The abstract provides no information on patient numbers, response rates, or adverse events specifically within the NET cohort. Therefore, the evidence is preliminary and requires confirmation in larger, Phase III trials.

14. Patient-reported symptom burden in patients with rare cancers receiving pembrolizumab in a phase II Clinical Trial.
   PMID: 35999229
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication is moderately relevant to NET therapy, specifically for patients with advanced disease where surgical options are exhausted. While the study focuses on “rare cancers” generally, NETs fall into this category and pembrolizumab is being investigated as a potential treatment option. Understanding the symptom burden associated with pembrolizumab is crucial for patient management and supportive care.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab treatment in patients with rare cancers is associated with significant symptom burden, primarily fatigue, pain, disturbed sleep, drowsiness, and lack of appetite.
* Approximately 43% of patients experienced a high symptom burden based on the five most severe symptoms, and 33% had high immunotherapy-specific symptom burden.
* Symptom trajectories remained relatively stable over the 9-week treatment period, suggesting early symptom assessment is predictive of ongoing burden.
* Interference with daily activities, particularly walking, was notably impacted by symptom burden.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   * Consider pembrolizumab as a potential treatment option for advanced NET patients who have failed other therapies or are not surgical candidates (as investigated in the NCT02721732 trial).
* Proactive symptom management is crucial when initiating pembrolizumab, with a focus on fatigue, pain, sleep disturbances, and appetite loss.
* Baseline symptom assessment using tools like the MDASI-Immunotherapy can help identify patients likely to experience high symptom burden and guide supportive care strategies.
* Regular monitoring of symptom burden throughout treatment is recommended to maintain quality of life.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, metastatic or unresectable NETs, particularly those who have progressed on standard therapies. The study population included patients with various rare solid tumors, and the results can be extrapolated to NET patients with similar disease characteristics. Patients should have adequate organ function to tolerate immunotherapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate. This is a Phase II clinical trial (NCT02721732) with a relatively small sample size (53 patients) across various rare cancers. While the study provides valuable insights into symptom burden, larger, randomized controlled trials specifically focused on NETs are needed to confirm these findings and establish definitive treatment guidelines. The prospective longitudinal design and use of a validated symptom inventory (MDASI) strengthen the study’s reliability.

15. Efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced cancer of unknown primary (CUP): a phase 2 non-randomized clinical trial.
   PMID: 35618285
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   While this study focuses on Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP), the underlying principle of evaluating pembrolizumab as a treatment option for advanced, aggressive cancers with limited alternatives is relevant to this NET patient. Given the high Ki-67 proliferation index (48%) and presence of lymph node and liver metastases, this patient’s disease is aggressive and may benefit from exploring immunotherapeutic options if standard therapies are insufficient. The study provides preliminary data on the potential role of PD-1 inhibition in challenging cancer cases.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated clinical activity in patients with CUP, suggesting potential benefit in aggressive, advanced cancers.
* The study highlights a need for further investigation of immune checkpoint inhibitors in rare and challenging malignancies like NETs.
* While not a primary outcome, the study supports the feasibility of evaluating immunotherapy in patients where standard treatment options are limited.
* The abstract doesn’t detail specific response rates or overall survival data, but indicates evaluation of efficacy was performed.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider pembrolizumab as a potential treatment option for this patient, *particularly* if standard therapies (e.g., somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy – likely streptozocin-based given the small bowel origin and aggressive nature) have been exhausted or are not feasible. Further biomarker analysis (beyond Ki-67) to assess potential predictive markers for response to pembrolizumab (e.g., PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability) should be performed. A multidisciplinary tumor board discussion is crucial to weigh the risks and benefits.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced, metastatic NETs (particularly those with high Ki-67 proliferation indices indicating aggressive disease) who have progressed on or are ineligible for standard therapies. Patients with limited treatment options and a high tumor burden may be most likely to benefit. The study suggests potential benefit even in cases where the primary tumor site is not fully known, which could be relevant if further metastatic sites emerge.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak. This is a Phase 2, non-randomized clinical trial (NCT02721732) focusing on CUP, not specifically NETs. The abstract provides limited details regarding patient numbers and specific outcomes. While the study demonstrates feasibility and potential activity, larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of pembrolizumab in NET patients. The PMID 35618285 refers to the abstract only; full text review would provide more detailed information.

16. Letter to the editor from Pant et al.
   PMID: 34725215
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase II study (NCT02721732) investigating pembrolizumab for rare tumors, including potentially neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Given the patient’s metastatic disease and high Ki-67 proliferation index, exploring immunotherapy options like pembrolizumab is clinically relevant, particularly when standard therapies are exhausted or not suitable.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study investigates pembrolizumab as a treatment option for patients with rare, unresectable or metastatic tumors.
* While the abstract is unavailable, the study design suggests an evaluation of pembrolizumab’s efficacy and safety in a broad range of rare cancers.
* Biomarker analysis is included, suggesting a potential attempt to identify predictive markers for response to pembrolizumab.
* Questionnaire administration indicates assessment of patient-reported outcomes alongside clinical response.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s G3 NET with high Ki-67 (48%) and metastatic disease, pembrolizumab *could* be considered as a potential treatment option, especially within a clinical trial setting. Further investigation into the specific results for NET patients within this study is crucial. Standard first-line therapies (e.g., somatostatin analogs, mTOR inhibitors) should be considered first, but if those fail or are contraindicated, pembrolizumab warrants exploration.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, unresectable or metastatic NETs, particularly those with limited treatment options. Patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) or PD-L1 expression (if assessed) might be more likely to benefit, although this study’s specific biomarker data is unavailable. The patient’s G3 status and high Ki-67 suggest a more aggressive tumor, potentially making them a candidate.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak at this stage, being a Phase II study. Phase II studies are designed to assess safety and preliminary efficacy, not to confirm benefit. The patient numbers are unknown without access to the full publication. The lack of an abstract limits the ability to assess the specific results related to NETs. Further data from larger, randomized Phase III trials are needed to establish pembrolizumab’s role in NET treatment.

17. Pembrolizumab in Patients with Refractory Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Phase&#xa0;II Trial.
   PMID: 34241781
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, focusing on pembrolizumab in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), has *potential* relevance to the presented NET patient, as pembrolizumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting the PD-1 pathway. While the study doesn’t directly address NETs, PD-1/PD-L1 expression and response to blockade are being investigated across various cancers, including some NET subtypes. Therefore, the findings regarding pembrolizumab’s activity warrant consideration in the context of treatment options for this patient, particularly given the aggressive features (G3, high Ki-67).

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrates antitumor activity in refractory advanced CSCC, suggesting potential efficacy in cancers resistant to standard therapies.
* Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis shows promise in improving outcomes for patients with advanced cancers.
* The study assesses the safety profile of pembrolizumab, which is crucial for evaluating its tolerability in other cancer types.
* The trial focuses on patients who have exhausted other treatment options, positioning pembrolizumab as a potential salvage therapy.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s aggressive G3 small bowel NET with lymph node and liver metastases, and following surgical resection, pembrolizumab *could* be considered within a clinical trial setting or off-label if PD-L1 expression is detected in the tumor tissue. Biomarker analysis (PD-L1 expression) is crucial before initiating treatment. Further investigation into the patient’s tumor microenvironment and PD-L1 status is warranted.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant to patients with advanced, refractory cancers, including potentially aggressive NET subtypes, who have progressed after standard therapies (surgery, chemotherapy, somatostatin analogs). Patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) or evidence of microsatellite instability (MSI) might be more likely to respond, although this wasn’t specifically assessed in this CSCC trial.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate. This is a Phase II trial, meaning it’s designed to assess safety and preliminary efficacy, not to definitively prove benefit. The study focuses on CSCC, not NETs, so the applicability is indirect. Patient numbers are not specified in the abstract, limiting the ability to assess statistical power. Further studies specifically evaluating pembrolizumab in NETs are needed to confirm these findings.

18. Pembrolizumab for advanced penile cancer: a case series from a phase II basket trial.
   PMID: 33770291
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication regarding pembrolizumab in penile squamous cell carcinoma has limited direct relevance to the treatment of small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). However, the study explores the efficacy of an immune checkpoint inhibitor (pembrolizumab) based on PD-L1 expression, a biomarker increasingly investigated in various cancers, including NETs. Therefore, it provides indirect insight into the potential role of immunotherapy in advanced, previously treated NETs, particularly those with potential PD-L1 expression.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated activity in advanced penile squamous cell carcinoma, a cancer with limited treatment options.
* A significant proportion (40-62%) of penile SCC patients express PD-L1, suggesting a potential biomarker for response to pembrolizumab.
* The case series highlights the potential for single-agent pembrolizumab in heavily pre-treated patients.
* While not directly assessed in this study, PD-L1 expression may correlate with response to pembrolizumab.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, and considering the patient’s G3 NET with high Ki-67 (48%) and metastatic disease, *exploratory* consideration of pembrolizumab, potentially in combination with other therapies, could be considered *after* standard first-line treatments (e.g., somatostatin analogs, mTOR inhibitors) have been exhausted. PD-L1 expression testing on the tumor tissue should be performed to assess potential predictive value. Enrollment in clinical trials investigating immunotherapy for NETs is strongly recommended.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings *might* be relevant for patients with advanced, metastatic NETs (like the presented case) who have progressed on standard therapies. Specifically, patients with high-grade (G3) NETs, like this case, and potentially those with evidence of PD-L1 expression on their tumor cells could be considered for investigation of pembrolizumab. However, this is an extrapolation from a different cancer type.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is low. This is a Phase II basket trial reporting a case series of only three patients with penile cancer. While suggestive, the small sample size and the different cancer type limit the strength of the evidence. Further research, specifically in NET populations, is needed to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab.

19. Pembrolizumab in Patients with Advanced Metastatic Germ Cell Tumors.
   PMID: 33491277
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication regarding pembrolizumab in germ cell tumors has *limited* direct relevance to the presented small intestinal NET case. While both are cancers, germ cell tumors have a significantly different biology and response profile to immunotherapy compared to most NETs. However, the study highlights potential reasons for immunotherapy failure, which could inform biomarker analysis in NET patients.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated limited anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated advanced germ cell tumors.
* Three patients achieved stable disease, but durations were relatively short (4.5-10.9 months).
* Low tumor mutational burden and low PD-1 expression are suggested as potential mechanisms of resistance to pembrolizumab.
* The study emphasizes the need for tumor profiling to understand resistance mechanisms and guide future immunotherapy trials.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, pembrolizumab *should not* be considered a standard treatment option for this patient without further investigation. Prior to considering pembrolizumab, comprehensive genomic profiling of the NET should be performed to assess tumor mutational burden (TMB) and PD-L1/PD-1 expression. If TMB is low and PD-L1 expression is minimal, the likelihood of benefit from pembrolizumab is low. Consideration could be given within a clinical trial setting.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant to patients with advanced, metastatic cancers, particularly those with limited treatment options. In the context of NETs, this *might* apply to patients with progressive disease after standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, targeted therapies) *if* biomarker analysis suggests potential sensitivity (high TMB, high PD-L1). However, this is speculative based on this germ cell tumor study.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak. This is a Phase II study with a very small sample size (n=12) of heavily pretreated patients with germ cell tumors. The findings are exploratory and require confirmation in larger, prospective studies specifically focused on NETs. The study provides insights into potential mechanisms of resistance but does not establish efficacy in NETs.

20. Efficacy of pembrolizumab in patients with pituitary carcinoma: report of four cases from a phase II study.
   PMID: 33427689
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the efficacy of pembrolizumab in pituitary carcinoma, a neuroendocrine tumor, within a Phase II clinical trial. While the study focuses on pituitary carcinoma specifically, the findings regarding immunotherapy with pembrolizumab in a neuroendocrine tumor context are potentially relevant to other NETs, particularly those that are aggressive and refractory to standard treatments. The exploration of biomarkers like hypermutator phenotype and PD-L1 expression could inform treatment strategies for various NET subtypes.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated partial radiographic and hormonal responses in two out of four patients with refractory corticotroph pituitary carcinoma.
* A hypermutator phenotype (MSH2/MSH6 mutations) in tumor tissue *after* temozolomide treatment correlated with response to pembrolizumab.
* PD-L1 expression was negative in all tumors studied, suggesting response isn’t necessarily linked to PD-L1 positivity.
* Stable disease was observed in one patient with a non-functioning corticotroph tumor, while one prolactin-secreting carcinoma showed progressive disease.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider pembrolizumab as a potential treatment option for patients with advanced, refractory NETs, *particularly* those with a high Ki-67 (as in this patient’s case – 48%) and after prior treatment with alkylating agents like temozolomide. Biomarker analysis, specifically assessing for a hypermutator phenotype (MSH2/MSH6 mutation status) *after* temozolomide exposure, should be performed to potentially predict response. Further investigation into the role of temozolomide as a potential sensitizer to immunotherapy is warranted.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced, metastatic or unresectable NETs who have progressed after standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy) are the most relevant population. The study suggests potential benefit in corticotroph tumors, but further research is needed to determine efficacy in other NET subtypes. Patients with high tumor mutational burden, potentially induced by prior alkylating agent treatment, may be more likely to respond.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited to a Phase II clinical trial with a very small sample size (n=4). This provides preliminary evidence of potential efficacy but requires confirmation in larger, randomized controlled trials. The findings are hypothesis-generating and should be interpreted cautiously. The study’s focus on pituitary carcinoma limits direct applicability to other NET subtypes.

21. The clinical efficacy and safety of single-agent pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent granulosa cell tumors of the ovary: a case series from a phase II basket trial.
   PMID: 33415580
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, while focused on granulosa cell tumors of the ovary, is potentially relevant to NET therapy due to the investigation of pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, in a rare tumor setting. The study explores the efficacy of single-agent immunotherapy in patients with limited treatment options, a situation often encountered in advanced NETs. However, direct extrapolation to intestinal NETs requires caution due to differing tumor biology.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated disease control (≥12 months) in 2 out of 5 patients with recurrent granulosa cell tumors, despite prior extensive systemic therapy.
* No objective responses were observed according to irRECIST criteria.
* PD-L1 expression was absent in all baseline tumor samples, suggesting response may not be linked to PD-L1 status.
* Pembrolizumab was well-tolerated with no grade 3 or 4 adverse events.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Pembrolizumab *may* be considered as a potential treatment option for heavily pre-treated intestinal NET patients with progressive disease and limited alternatives, particularly if other standard therapies have failed. Given the lack of observed response in PD-L1 positive tumors in this study, PD-L1 status should not be the sole determinant for treatment decisions. Further investigation into biomarkers predictive of response is warranted.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy might be considered for patients with advanced, recurrent, and unresectable intestinal NETs (similar to the study population of recurrent GCT) who have progressed after multiple lines of standard therapy (somatostatin analogs, mTOR inhibitors, chemotherapy). Patients with high tumor burden and aggressive disease (like the G3, Ki67 48% case presented) might be considered, but expectations should be managed regarding objective response rates.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited. This is a Phase II basket trial case series (n=5) focusing on granulosa cell tumors, not NETs. The findings are preliminary and exploratory. While demonstrating acceptable safety, the lack of objective responses and small sample size necessitate further investigation in dedicated NET clinical trials before widespread adoption of pembrolizumab monotherapy.

22. Phase II study of pembrolizumab efficacy and safety in women with recurrent small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lower genital tract.
   PMID: 32534809
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, while focused on small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNEC) of the lower genital tract, holds *potential* relevance for the patient’s small bowel NET, particularly given the aggressive nature indicated by the high Ki-67 proliferation index (48%). Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, is being investigated as a treatment option for neuroendocrine carcinomas, and exploring its efficacy in similar, albeit different, NET subtypes may offer insights. However, direct extrapolation requires caution due to differing tumor biology between small cell and non-small cell NETs.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study investigated the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab in recurrent SCNEC.
* While the abstract doesn’t detail specific efficacy data (ORR, PFS, OS), it confirms pembrolizumab was evaluated in this context.
* The study assessed both efficacy *and* safety, providing a preliminary understanding of potential adverse events.
* The study focuses on a recurrent disease setting, suggesting potential benefit after initial treatment failure.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s G3 NET with liver and lymph node metastases post-surgery, pembrolizumab *could* be considered as part of a clinical trial or off-label use, particularly if other standard therapies (e.g., somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy) are ineffective or not suitable. Further investigation into PD-L1 expression in the patient’s tumor tissue would be crucial before initiating treatment. A multidisciplinary tumor board discussion is essential.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with *aggressive* NETs (high Ki-67, like this patient’s 48%) that have progressed after initial surgery and potentially other systemic therapies. Patients with limited treatment options and a high tumor burden might benefit from exploring immunotherapy. The original study population was women with recurrent SCNEC, so applicability to men and other NET subtypes needs careful consideration.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak. This is a Phase II study, meaning it’s designed to assess preliminary efficacy and safety, not to confirm benefit. The abstract provides limited information regarding patient numbers and specific outcomes. The study population (SCNEC of the lower genital tract) differs from the patient’s small bowel NET, limiting the direct applicability of the findings.

23. Decrease in tumor content assessed in biopsies is associated with improved treatment outcome response to pembrolizumab in patients with rare tumors.
   PMID: 32303619
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the predictive biomarker potential of tumor content (TC) changes during pembrolizumab treatment, which is directly relevant to NET patients, particularly those with limited treatment options like this patient with metastatic disease. While the study isn’t NET-specific, the principle of assessing treatment response via TC reduction could be applicable to guide treatment continuation or modification in NET cases.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Decreased tumor content (TC) in biopsies *during* treatment with pembrolizumab is associated with improved treatment outcome.
* Assessing TC changes from baseline to on-treatment (the “shift in TC”) can predict response to pembrolizumab.
* The study suggests that TC assessment in biopsies can serve as a surrogate marker for treatment efficacy, potentially earlier than traditional imaging.
* This finding supports the idea that early assessment of treatment impact on tumor cells themselves, not just tumor size, is important.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider pembrolizumab as a potential treatment option for this patient with metastatic, high-grade (G3, Ki67 48%) small bowel NET, particularly given the limited surgical options. Serial biopsies during treatment should be performed to assess tumor content changes. A decrease in TC could indicate a positive response and support continued treatment, while a lack of decrease might suggest treatment failure and the need for alternative strategies.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This finding is most relevant for patients with rare tumors, including NETs, who are treated with pembrolizumab and for whom surgical resection is not feasible or the disease is metastatic. Patients with high-grade NETs, like this case (G3, Ki67 48%), might be more likely to benefit, as they often have a higher mutational burden which can increase responsiveness to immunotherapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate, stemming from a Phase II study (NCT02721732). The publication (PMID: 32303619) reports on biomarker analysis within this Phase II trial, but doesn’t specify the total patient number included in the analysis. Phase II studies are designed to assess efficacy and safety, but require confirmation in larger, randomized Phase III trials. The study’s applicability to NET specifically needs further investigation.
----------------------------------------

24. Phase 2 study of pembrolizumab in patients with advanced rare cancers.
   PMID: 32188704
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the use of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, in advanced rare cancers, which includes the potential for applicability to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) given their relative rarity and often limited treatment options. While not NET-specific, the study’s investigation of immunotherapy in challenging cancers is relevant considering the patient’s advanced disease (metastatic to lymph nodes and liver) and high Ki-67 proliferation index, suggesting a potentially aggressive tumor. The study offers a potential avenue for treatment consideration when standard therapies are exhausted.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Pembrolizumab demonstrated activity in a cohort of patients with advanced rare cancers, suggesting potential benefit beyond common cancer types.
* The study supports the rationale for evaluating immunotherapy, specifically PD-1 inhibition, in rare cancers where conventional treatments have failed.
* While the overall response rate isn’t specified in the abstract, the study indicates that some patients experienced clinical benefit.
* The study highlights the need for clinical trials to investigate immunotherapy in rare cancer subtypes, including NETs.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Pembrolizumab should be considered as a potential treatment option for this patient *after* surgical resection and in the context of a clinical trial, given the advanced stage of disease (metastatic to liver and lymph nodes) and high Ki-67 (48%). Standard therapies (e.g., somatostatin analogs, targeted therapies if receptor positive) should be optimized first. Pembrolizumab is not a standard first-line treatment, but may be considered in a later line setting or within a clinical trial framework.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, metastatic NETs who have progressed on or are ineligible for standard therapies. Patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) or PD-L1 expression (although not assessed in this abstract) might be more likely to respond, but this remains speculative without further biomarker data. The patient’s G3 designation and high Ki-67 suggest a more aggressive tumor, potentially making them a candidate for immunotherapy exploration.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate, stemming from a Phase II clinical trial (NCT02721732). Phase II trials are designed to assess efficacy and safety, but are not definitive. The abstract does not provide patient numbers or specific response rates, limiting the strength of the conclusions. Further investigation of the full publication and ideally, larger Phase III trials, are needed to confirm these findings and establish pembrolizumab’s role in NET treatment.
----------------------------------------

25. Phase II clinical trial of pembrolizumab efficacy and safety in advanced adrenocortical carcinoma.
   PMID: 31533818
   Study: Pembrolizumab in Treating Patients With Rare Tumors That Cannot Be Removed by Surgery or Are Metastatic (NCT02721732)
   Publication Date: 2019
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   While this study focuses on adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), a different rare tumor type, the investigation of pembrolizumab’s efficacy as a single agent in advanced, previously treated malignancies is potentially relevant to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), particularly those with limited treatment options and high proliferative indices. The rationale for exploring PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors like pembrolizumab stems from potential immune evasion mechanisms common to various cancers, including some NET subtypes. However, direct extrapolation requires caution due to differing tumor biology.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study evaluated pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic ACC, a disease with limited effective therapies.
* Pembrolizumab demonstrated some clinical activity in ACC, suggesting potential benefit in heavily pre-treated patients.
* The study assessed the safety profile of pembrolizumab in this patient population.
* While not a primary endpoint, the study provides data on response rates and progression-free survival with pembrolizumab in a rare cancer setting.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s G3 NET with high Ki-67 (48%), indicating a more aggressive tumor, and the presence of lymph node and liver metastases, pembrolizumab *could* be considered as part of a clinical trial or off-label use, particularly if standard therapies (e.g., somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy) have failed or are not suitable. Given the limited options for high-grade, metastatic NETs, exploring immunotherapy is reasonable, but should be done within a well-defined treatment plan and with careful monitoring. Biomarker analysis (PD-L1 expression, MSI-H/dMMR status) should be performed to potentially predict response.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings *might* be relevant for patients with advanced, metastatic NETs (like the presented case) who have progressed on or are ineligible for standard therapies. Patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) or evidence of immune cell infiltration may be more likely to benefit, although this wasn’t specifically assessed in this ACC study. The patient’s G3 status and high Ki-67 suggest a more aggressive disease course, potentially making them a candidate for more aggressive treatment strategies like immunotherapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate. This is a Phase II clinical trial, meaning it is designed to assess efficacy and safety, but is not definitive. The study focuses on ACC, not NETs, limiting direct applicability. The patient numbers in Phase II trials are typically relatively small, and further investigation in larger, randomized controlled trials specifically focused on NETs is needed to confirm these findings. The NCT ID (NCT02721732) allows for further investigation of the study details.

26. [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus long-acting octreotide versus high&#x2011;dose long-acting octreotide for the treatment of newly diagnosed, advanced grade 2-3, well-differentiated, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETTER-2): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study.
   PMID: 38851203
   Study: Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET (NCT03972488)
   Publication Date: 2024
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses a critical unmet need in the first-line treatment of advanced, higher-grade (2-3) GEP-NETs, a category to which the patient’s small bowel NET with liver metastases falls. The NETTER-2 trial investigates a potentially superior alternative to current standard of care, offering a new therapeutic avenue for patients with progressive disease.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus long-acting octreotide (LAR) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to high-dose LAR octreotide alone in patients with advanced grade 2-3, well-differentiated GEP-NETs.
*   The study demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in the objective response rate (ORR) with the addition of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE.
*   The safety profile of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus LAR octreotide was manageable, with the most common adverse events being hematological toxicities.
*   The study confirms the importance of somatostatin receptor expression for the efficacy of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE therapy.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the NETTER-2 trial results, first-line treatment with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in combination with LAR octreotide should be considered for patients with newly diagnosed, advanced grade 2-3, well-differentiated GEP-NETs. This is particularly relevant given the patient’s G3 status and presence of liver metastases following surgical resection.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with:
*   Newly diagnosed advanced (metastatic) GEP-NETs.
*   Well-differentiated tumors (grade 2 or 3).
*   Tumors expressing somatostatin receptors (demonstrated through imaging like Ga-68 DOTATATE PET/CT).
*   Performance status allowing for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized controlled trial (NCT03972488). While open-label introduces potential bias, the Phase 3 design and randomization provide strong evidence. The publication (PMID: 38851203) represents the primary analysis of the NETTER-2 study, suggesting a robust dataset. Specific patient numbers are not provided in the abstract, but a Phase 3 trial generally involves a substantial number of participants, increasing the reliability of the findings.

27. State of the art and future directions in the systemic treatment of neuroendocrine neoplasms.
   PMID: 33973550
   Study: Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET (NCT03972488)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication provides a broad overview of systemic treatment options for neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), which is directly relevant to the clinical question of further therapy for this patient with advanced small bowel NET and metastatic disease. It highlights the challenges in NEN treatment due to limited robust data and the importance of considering multiple prognostic factors when selecting a treatment strategy.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The treatment of advanced NENs is hampered by a lack of extensive, high-quality clinical trial data.
* Prognostic factors like tumor grade, location, hormone secretion, and receptor expression significantly influence disease course and treatment response.
* Somatostatin receptor expression and FDG-avidity are crucial for guiding treatment decisions, particularly regarding somatostatin analog therapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).
* The abstract emphasizes the need for individualized treatment approaches based on a comprehensive assessment of these factors.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   While the abstract doesn’t detail *specific* recommendations, it implicitly supports consideration of somatostatin analog therapy (like Octreotide LAR) and PRRT (like Lutathera, as referenced by the NCT ID) in appropriately selected patients. The provided NCT ID (NCT03972488) specifically investigates Lutathera in Grade 2 & 3 advanced GEP-NETs, making it a potential option. Further investigation of the NCT03972488 study results is warranted.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* GEP-NETs (like this patient with liver metastases), particularly those with well-differentiated tumors (Grade 2 or 3). The patient’s Ki67 of 48% indicates a higher grade (G3) and proliferative rate, potentially making them a candidate for more aggressive therapies like PRRT. Somatostatin receptor expression (not provided in the patient context) would be critical to assess for suitability of Octreotide LAR and Lutathera.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The abstract itself is a review and doesn’t present original data. However, it references the NCT03972488 study, which is a Phase 3 clinical trial. Phase 3 trials generally provide stronger evidence than earlier phase studies. The strength of the evidence ultimately depends on the results of NCT03972488 and the number of patients enrolled.

   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication discusses the role of angiogenesis inhibitors in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), a class of cancers to which the patient’s small bowel NET belongs. Given the patient’s metastatic disease (liver and lymph nodes), exploring systemic therapies like angiogenesis inhibitors is clinically relevant when considering options beyond surgery. The study specifically investigates cabozantinib, offering potential insights into its efficacy compared to placebo.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The publication suggests angiogenesis inhibitors are becoming a more established treatment option for NETs.
* Cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-angiogenic properties, is being investigated as a potential therapy for advanced NETs.
* The NCT study (NCT03375320) is specifically designed to evaluate cabozantinib in advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors.
* Angiogenesis inhibition targets the tumor microenvironment, potentially slowing tumor growth and progression.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study investigates cabozantinib as a potential treatment option for advanced NETs. Considering the patient’s progression after surgery (metastases to lymph nodes and liver), cabozantinib should be considered as a potential alternative or addition to current standard of care options like PRRT or everolimus. Further investigation of the NCT03375320 study results is warranted to determine its efficacy and safety profile.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy is relevant for patients with *advanced* NETs, specifically those with progressive disease despite initial treatment (like surgery in this case) and evidence of metastatic spread. The study focuses on pancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors, making it directly applicable to this patient’s small bowel NET (carcinoid tumors are a subtype of NET). Patients with measurable disease on imaging are ideal candidates for assessing treatment response.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The study is a Phase III clinical trial (NCT03375320), indicating a higher level of evidence compared to Phase I or II trials. However, the abstract provided does not detail patient numbers or specific outcomes. The strength of the evidence will depend on the results of the completed trial, which are referenced by the PMID (33152282) but not provided here. Further review of the full publication is necessary to assess the study’s power, statistical significance, and clinical relevance.

2. 177Lu-Dotatate plus long-acting octreotide versus high&#x2011;dose long-acting octreotide in patients with midgut neuroendocrine tumours (NETTER-1): final overall survival and long-term safety results from an open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.
   PMID: 34793718
   Study: A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to Octreotide LAR in Patients With Inoperable, Progressive, Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours (NCT01578239)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the optimal systemic therapy for advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), a condition the patient presents with (small bowel NET with liver metastases). The study compares PRRT (using 177Lu-Dotatate) combined with somatostatin analog (octreotide LAR) to high-dose octreotide LAR alone, offering crucial guidance for post-surgical adjuvant or palliative treatment decisions.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The NETTER-1 trial demonstrated a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with the addition of 177Lu-Dotatate to long-acting octreotide compared to high-dose octreotide alone.
* This final analysis confirms these PFS benefits and provides long-term overall survival (OS) data, further supporting the combination therapy.
* The study provides long-term safety data, indicating a manageable safety profile for the combination therapy.
* While the abstract doesn't detail OS benefit magnitude, the primary analysis showed a significant PFS advantage, suggesting a potential for improved long-term outcomes.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the NETTER-1 trial results, the combination of 177Lu-Dotatate and long-acting octreotide is recommended over high-dose long-acting octreotide alone for patients with advanced, progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive midgut NETs. Given the patient’s disease stage (metastatic) and prior surgery, this combination should be strongly considered.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with:
* Advanced (metastatic) midgut NETs (specifically small bowel NETs, as in this case).
* Progressive disease despite or after initial treatment (surgery in this case).
* Somatostatin receptor-positive tumors (although the patient’s DOTATOC PET showed only *low* uptake, this doesn’t necessarily preclude PRRT, and further assessment of receptor density is warranted).

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (NETTER-1). Phase 3 trials provide high-level evidence. The abstract doesn’t state the exact patient number, but Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of participants, increasing the reliability of the findings. The final analysis reported here adds to the robustness of the initial results.

3. Impact of liver tumour burden, alkaline phosphatase elevation, and target lesion size on treatment outcomes with 177Lu-Dotatate: an analysis of the NETTER-1 study.
   PMID: 32123969
   Study: A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to Octreotide LAR in Patients With Inoperable, Progressive, Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours (NCT01578239)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the efficacy of 177Lu-Dotatate (Lutetium-177 DOTATATE) in patients with midgut neuroendocrine tumors, a relevant disease entity for the patient described. The study analyzes factors influencing treatment response, providing valuable information for treatment selection and potentially predicting outcomes in similar cases.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   Baseline liver tumor burden, elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and target lesion size significantly impact treatment outcomes with 177Lu-Dotatate.
*   Higher liver tumor burden at baseline was associated with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) on 177Lu-Dotatate.
*   Elevated ALP levels at baseline were also linked to worse PFS, suggesting potential liver dysfunction impacts treatment effectiveness.
*   Larger target lesion size correlated with a less favorable response to 177Lu-Dotatate.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study supports the use of 177Lu-Dotatate for somatostatin receptor-positive midgut carcinoid tumors. However, it highlights the importance of considering baseline liver tumor burden, ALP levels, and lesion size when making treatment decisions. Patients with high liver burden, elevated ALP, or large lesions may benefit from alternative or additional therapies alongside PRRT, or may have a lower expectation of response.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with inoperable, progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive midgut carcinoid tumors, specifically those with liver metastases. The study focuses on patients similar to the described case, with a history of surgical resection but ongoing metastatic disease.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is a retrospective analysis of the Phase III NETTER-1 study (NCT01578239), which compared 177Lu-Dotatate to Octreotide LAR. While retrospective, the analysis is based on data from a large, randomized controlled trial, providing relatively strong evidence. The original NETTER-1 study enrolled a significant number of patients, enhancing the reliability of these subgroup analyses.
----------------------------------------

4. Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Progressive Midgut Neuroendocrine Tumors Treated With 177Lu-Dotatate in the Phase III NETTER-1 Trial.
   PMID: 29878866
   Study: A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to Octreotide LAR in Patients With Inoperable, Progressive, Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours (NCT01578239)
   Publication Date: 2018
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses a critical aspect of NET treatment – quality of life – alongside established efficacy measures like progression-free survival. The study provides valuable data comparing two treatment options for progressive midgut NETs, informing decisions beyond simply tumor control. It supports the consideration of patient-reported outcomes when selecting therapy.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * 177Lu-Dotatate significantly prolonged the time to deterioration in health-related quality of life (TTD) across multiple domains compared to octreotide LAR.
* Clinically significant improvements in TTD were observed in global health status (28.8 vs 6.1 months) and physical functioning (25.2 vs 11.5 months) with 177Lu-Dotatate.
* The study demonstrates that 177Lu-Dotatate not only improves progression-free survival but also positively impacts how patients *feel* during treatment.
* Improvements were seen across several QoL domains including fatigue, pain, diarrhea, and disease-related worries.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   For patients with progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive midgut NETs, 177Lu-Dotatate should be strongly considered as a first-line therapy option over high-dose octreotide LAR, particularly when quality of life is a significant concern. The data supports a proactive approach to managing symptoms and maintaining patient well-being.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with progressive, somatostatin receptor-positive midgut neuroendocrine tumors (specifically small intestinal NETs) who are *inoperable*. The study population included patients experiencing disease progression despite prior treatment, suggesting it’s applicable to those failing or unsuitable for surgery.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This study is a Phase III, randomized, controlled trial (NETTER-1) with a robust methodology and a relatively large patient population (n=117 in the 177Lu-Dotatate arm, n=114 in the octreotide arm). The intention-to-treat analysis strengthens the validity of the results. The findings are considered high-quality evidence supporting the use of 177Lu-Dotatate in this specific patient population.
----------------------------------------

5. Phase 3 Trial of 177Lu-Dotatate for Midgut Neuroendocrine Tumors.
   PMID: 28076709
   Study: A Study Comparing Treatment With 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate to Octreotide LAR in Patients With Inoperable, Progressive, Somatostatin Receptor Positive Midgut Carcinoid Tumours (NCT01578239)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication is highly relevant for the treatment of the patient’s midgut NET, specifically considering progression after initial somatostatin analogue therapy. The study directly addresses the question of whether 177Lu-Dotatate offers a benefit over continued octreotide LAR in patients with progressive disease, a scenario the patient may face. The findings provide crucial evidence for considering PRRT as a next-line therapy option.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study demonstrates the efficacy of 177Lu-Dotatate in patients with advanced, progressive midgut NETs who have progressed *during* first-line somatostatin analogue therapy.
* 177Lu-Dotatate significantly improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared to continued octreotide LAR in this patient population. (While the abstract doesn’t provide specific PFS data, the study’s overall impact hinges on this finding).
* The study evaluates the safety profile of 177Lu-Dotatate, providing information on potential side effects.
* The study focuses on somatostatin receptor-positive tumors, highlighting the importance of receptor expression for treatment effectiveness.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the study results, 177Lu-Dotatate (PRRT) should be strongly considered as a therapeutic option for this patient *if* the tumor remains somatostatin receptor-positive (which needs confirmation, given the initially “geringe Speicherung” on DOTATOC PET). Given the patient’s progression after surgery and potential for further progression, initiating PRRT is a reasonable next step, assuming adequate performance status and no contraindications.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with:
* Advanced midgut neuroendocrine tumors (like the patient’s ileal NET with liver metastases).
* Progressive disease *after* demonstrating initial response or stability to somatostatin analogue therapy (octreotide LAR).
* Somatostatin receptor-positive tumors (confirmed by PET/CT imaging).

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong. This is a Phase 3, randomized, controlled trial (NCT01578239, PMID: 28076709). While the abstract doesn’t state the exact patient number, Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of participants, providing robust statistical power. The study design allows for a reliable comparison between 177Lu-Dotatate and octreotide LAR.

6. Ribociclib and everolimus in well-differentiated foregut neuroendocrine tumors.
   PMID: 33640871
   Study: A Study of LEE011 With Everolimus in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03070301)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses potential systemic therapies for well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), a disease state relevant to the patient’s diagnosis of a small intestinal NET with liver metastases. While the study investigates a combination therapy (ribociclib + everolimus), it provides valuable information regarding the efficacy and toxicity profile of everolimus in combination with another agent, informing the clinical question of whether everolimus alone is a suitable next step.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrated insufficient activity in advanced foregut WDNETs, failing to meet pre-specified criteria for advancement to phase II.
* No objective responses were observed; however, a majority of patients (62%) experienced stable disease.
* Significant hematologic (myelosuppression) and infectious toxicities were observed, leading to trial modification and frequent dose reductions/interruptions.
* Genomic analysis of tumor samples failed to identify predictive biomarkers for response or stabilization.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, the combination of ribociclib and everolimus is *not* recommended for patients with advanced foregut WDNETs. While everolimus as a single agent was not directly tested in this study, the significant toxicity observed with the combination, without demonstrable efficacy, does not support adding ribociclib to everolimus. The clinical question remains open regarding everolimus monotherapy versus PRRT.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant to patients with *well-differentiated* (WD) foregut NETs (esophageal, gastric, duodenal, pancreatic). Given the patient’s small intestinal NET, this is relevant, but the foregut origin needs to be confirmed as a primary characteristic. The study included patients with advanced disease, meaning metastatic or unresectable disease.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter study with a relatively small sample size (n=21). The study did not meet its primary endpoint and was modified mid-trial due to toxicity, limiting the strength of the evidence. While the findings are informative, larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively assess the role of ribociclib and everolimus in this patient population.

7. Efficacy and safety of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin in relapsed small cell lung cancer. Results from an expansion cohort of a phase I study.
   PMID: 33704620
   Study: Study Escalating Doses of PM01183 in Combination With Fixed Doxorubicin in Patients With Specific Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors (NCT01970540)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase I study evaluating lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin for relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). While the study focuses on SCLC, the potential activity of lurbinectedin, a DNA damaging agent, warrants consideration in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) particularly those with limited therapeutic options, although direct extrapolation requires caution. The mechanism of action could potentially be relevant in certain NET subtypes.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The combination of doxorubicin and lurbinectedin demonstrated a 36% overall response rate (ORR) in relapsed SCLC.
* Patients with sensitive disease (longer chemotherapy-free interval) had a significantly higher ORR (50%) and improved PFS/OS compared to those with resistant disease.
* The primary toxicity observed was manageable myelosuppression, with mostly mild to moderate non-hematological side effects.
* The combination showed noteworthy activity and a manageable safety profile, leading to evaluation in a Phase III trial.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressed disease (NET des Dünndarms with lymph node and liver metastases) and the limited somatostatin receptor expression on the liver lesions (low DOTATOC uptake), lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin *could* be considered as a potential off-label treatment option, particularly if PRRT and Everolimus are not feasible or have failed. However, this should be discussed within a multidisciplinary tumor board and with full patient informed consent, acknowledging the limited evidence in NETs. A trial within a clinical study would be preferable.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This combination might be considered for patients with advanced, unresectable NETs who have progressed after standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, PRRT, systemic chemotherapy). Patients with a relatively good performance status are likely to tolerate the myelosuppression better. The study suggests a potential benefit in patients with less aggressive disease, but this is based on SCLC characteristics and needs further investigation in NETs.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to a Phase I expansion cohort study (NCT01970540) with 28 patients with SCLC. While the results are promising in SCLC, they cannot be directly extrapolated to NETs. The study provides preliminary evidence of activity and safety, but larger, randomized controlled trials specifically in NET patients are needed to confirm these findings and establish the optimal dose and schedule.

8. Phase I Study of Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 Inhibitor, CC-90011, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
   PMID: 33046517
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced solid tumors, which *could* have relevance for NET treatment given the role of LSD1 in cancer stem cells and potential chemoresistance – a common issue in NET progression. However, the study doesn’t specifically focus on NETs, and the relevance is currently exploratory, based on the mechanistic rationale of LSD1 inhibition in cancer.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * CC-90011 is a potent, selective, and reversible oral LSD1 inhibitor.
* The study investigated CC-90011 in both advanced solid tumors *and* relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, suggesting a broad potential application.
* LSD1 expression in cancer stem cells is linked to chemoresistance, indicating CC-90011 might overcome resistance mechanisms.
* The study is a Phase I trial, primarily focused on safety and dose escalation, with limited efficacy data presented in the abstract.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this Phase I study *alone*, CC-90011 cannot be routinely recommended for NET treatment. However, it warrants consideration for *investigational* use in patients with advanced, progressive NET who have exhausted standard therapies (like somatostatin analogs and targeted therapies) and exhibit evidence of chemoresistance. Further research specifically in NETs is crucial. It is not a substitute for established therapies like Everolimus or PRRT at this stage.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings *might* be relevant for patients with advanced NET (like the described case with liver metastases) who have progressed despite initial surgery and are refractory to, or have relapsed after, standard treatments. Patients with evidence of chemoresistance (difficult to definitively prove clinically) could be particularly interesting candidates for future studies.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is very low. This is a Phase I study, meaning it primarily assesses safety and determines a recommended dose. Patient numbers are likely small, and the focus is not on demonstrating efficacy. The abstract provides limited information, and conclusions regarding therapeutic benefit are premature. Further studies (Phase II and III) specifically designed for NET patients are needed to establish efficacy and safety.

9. Clinical activity of CC-90011, an oral, potent, and reversible LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies.
   PMID: 35737639
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the Phase 1 study of CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies, including some hematological cancers. While not specifically focused on NETs, LSD1 inhibition is a potential therapeutic strategy being explored in various cancers, including some preclinical NET models, making this publication potentially relevant for consideration in heavily pre-treated or refractory cases. The relevance is currently exploratory, requiring further investigation in NET-specific studies.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * CC-90011 demonstrates clinical activity in advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma.
* The drug is orally bioavailable, potent, selective, and reversible in its inhibition of LSD1.
* CC-90011 was generally well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study.
* Long-term follow-up suggests durable responses in some patients, although the specific response rates are not detailed in the abstract.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this Phase 1 data, CC-90011 *could* be considered in the context of clinical trials for patients with advanced NETs who have progressed on standard therapies (somatostatin analogs, PRRT, everolimus, systemic chemotherapy). It is *not* a standard of care recommendation at this time. Further research is needed to determine efficacy in NET subtypes.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced solid tumors, including potentially NETs, who have failed prior lines of therapy and have limited treatment options. Patients with relapsed or refractory marginal zone lymphoma also fall into this category. The study doesn't specify if certain NET subtypes might be more responsive.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is very preliminary. This is a Phase 1 study, primarily designed to assess safety and determine a recommended dose. Patient numbers are likely small, and efficacy data is limited. The abstract provides only a high-level overview; detailed response rates and survival data are not available. Further studies (Phase 2 and 3) are required to establish the efficacy and safety of CC-90011 in NET patients.

10. Phase 1 safety and pharmacodynamic study of lenalidomide combined with everolimus in patients with advanced solid malignancies with efficacy signal in adenoid cystic carcinoma.
   PMID: 32704173
   Study: Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Combination With Lenalidomide (NCT01218555)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the combination of lenalidomide and everolimus, a regimen potentially relevant for NET patients, particularly those with progressive disease despite initial therapies. While the study doesn’t focus specifically on NETs, the rationale for combining a mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) with an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide) to enhance cytotoxicity is applicable to NET treatment strategies. The observed efficacy signal in adenoid cystic carcinoma suggests a potential benefit in other neuroendocrine malignancies.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The combination of lenalidomide and everolimus was assessed for safety and pharmacodynamic effects in patients with advanced solid tumors.
* The study demonstrated enhanced preclinical cytotoxicity with the combination, suggesting a synergistic effect.
* While primarily a safety and pharmacokinetic study, an efficacy signal was observed in adenoid cystic carcinoma patients.
* The study provides data on the tolerability of the combination, identifying potential adverse events.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this Phase I study, the combination of lenalidomide and everolimus *could* be considered in heavily pre-treated NET patients, particularly if they have progressive disease and limited other options. However, this should be within the context of a clinical trial or with careful monitoring due to the Phase I nature of the study and potential for toxicity. Further investigation specifically in NET patients is warranted. It is *not* a first-line recommendation given the limited data.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This combination might be relevant for patients with advanced NETs (like the described case with liver and lymph node metastases) who have failed standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, PRRT). Patients with good performance status are likely to tolerate the combination better. The efficacy signal in adenoid cystic carcinoma suggests potential benefit in slow-growing, well-differentiated NETs, but this is speculative.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is low. This is a Phase I study with a limited number of patients with *various* advanced solid malignancies, not specifically NETs. The primary focus was safety and pharmacokinetics, with efficacy being a secondary exploratory endpoint. The observed efficacy signal in adenoid cystic carcinoma is promising but requires confirmation in larger, disease-specific studies.

11. A Phase II Study of Ziv-Aflibercept in Patients With Advanced Extrapancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.
   PMID: 36395401
   Study: Ziv-Aflibercept for Advanced Progressive Carcinoid Tumors (NCT01782443)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses potential therapies for NET patients, specifically those with advanced disease. Given the patient’s diagnosis of a G2 small bowel NET with lymph node and liver metastases, and progression despite surgery, exploring systemic therapies like Ziv-aflibercept is clinically relevant. The study focuses on VEGF inhibition, a pathway often implicated in NET angiogenesis and growth.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Ziv-aflibercept targets VEGF, a protein frequently expressed by NETs, suggesting a rational therapeutic approach.
* The study demonstrates activity of Ziv-aflibercept in advanced extrapancreatic NETs, indicating potential benefit in this disease setting.
* While the abstract doesn’t detail specific response rates or progression-free survival, it confirms the feasibility of investigating Ziv-aflibercept in this patient population.
* The study provides a basis for considering VEGF inhibition as a potential treatment option when other therapies have failed or are not suitable.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Ziv-aflibercept should be considered as a potential treatment option for this patient, particularly given the limited uptake on DOTATOC PET suggesting limited somatostatin receptor expression. It could be explored as an alternative or in combination with other therapies like Everolimus or PRRT, depending on further patient characteristics and disease progression. A thorough discussion of potential benefits and risks is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* extrapancreatic NETs (like this small bowel NET with metastases) who have progressed on or are not candidates for other standard therapies. Patients with measurable disease and adequate performance status are most likely to benefit from participation in clinical trials or consideration of this therapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderate. This is a Phase II study (NCT01782443), which primarily assesses safety and preliminary efficacy. While it demonstrates activity, larger Phase III trials are needed to confirm these findings and establish definitive efficacy and optimal treatment regimens. The abstract does not provide patient numbers, limiting a full assessment of statistical power.

12. Dual inactivation of Akt and ERK by TIC10 signals Foxo3a nuclear translocation, TRAIL gene induction, and potent antitumor effects.
   PMID: 23390247
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2013
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the preclinical activity of TIC10, a small molecule inducing TRAIL expression, and its potential as an antitumor agent. While not directly studied in NET patients in this publication, the mechanism of action – inducing apoptosis via the TRAIL pathway – is relevant as NETs can be sensitive to apoptotic stimuli, and current therapies often aim to overcome resistance to apoptosis. The study suggests a novel approach to enhance endogenous tumor suppressor activity.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * TIC10 is an orally active small molecule that induces TRAIL expression in both tumor and normal cells, independent of p53 status.
* TIC10 inactivates Akt and ERK kinases, leading to Foxo3a nuclear translocation and subsequent upregulation of the TRAIL gene.
* TIC10 demonstrates antitumor activity by enhancing endogenous TRAIL concentrations, impacting both tumor cells and their microenvironment.
* TIC10 crosses the blood-brain barrier, suggesting potential for treating brain metastases, a common issue in NETs.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   TIC10, or similar compounds targeting the Akt/ERK pathway to induce TRAIL expression, could be considered as a potential therapeutic option, particularly in combination with existing therapies like somatostatin analogs or targeted agents. Further investigation is needed to determine its efficacy and safety in NET patients. Given the patient’s limited response to DOTATOC PET (suggesting low somatostatin receptor expression), exploring alternative pathways like TRAIL induction may be beneficial. This should be considered *after* standard first-line therapies have been exhausted or are unsuitable.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This approach may be particularly relevant for NET patients with limited somatostatin receptor expression (like the presented case with low DOTATOC uptake), or those who have progressed on somatostatin analog therapy. Patients with tumors exhibiting resistance to apoptosis may also benefit. The potential for blood-brain barrier penetration makes it interesting for patients with brain metastases.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented is from a preclinical study (in vitro and in vivo models). The publication (PMID: 23390247) does not report clinical trial data. The NCT ID (NCT03034200) refers to a Phase 2 study of ONC201 (likely related to TIC10), but the publication itself doesn’t provide details on that trial. Therefore, the evidence is currently weak and requires confirmation through robust clinical trials (Phase II and III) with larger patient cohorts.
----------------------------------------

13. Identification of TRAIL-inducing compounds highlights small molecule ONC201/TIC10 as a unique anti-cancer agent that activates the TRAIL pathway.
   PMID: 25927855
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2015
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the preclinical rationale for ONC201/TIC10, a small molecule inducing the TRAIL pathway, as a potential anti-cancer agent. While not specifically focused on NETs, the TRAIL pathway is a potential vulnerability in various cancers, and exploring novel mechanisms of action is relevant given the challenges in treating advanced NETs, particularly those with limited somatostatin receptor expression (as suggested by the low DOTATOC uptake in this patient). Therefore, this study provides a potential avenue for investigation in NET treatment.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * ONC201/TIC10 is a small molecule that induces the expression of the TRAIL gene.
* TRAIL is a protein that can trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells.
* ONC201/TIC10 aims to overcome limitations associated with directly administering recombinant TRAIL.
* Preclinical models demonstrated promising safety and antitumor efficacy with ONC201/TIC10.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study suggests considering ONC201/TIC10 as a potential therapeutic option, particularly in NET patients who have progressed on or are refractory to standard therapies like somatostatin analogs and targeted therapies (e.g., everolimus). Given the patient’s metastatic disease and potentially limited somatostatin receptor expression, exploring novel agents like ONC201/TIC10 is reasonable, potentially within a clinical trial setting. It is *not* a replacement for standard first-line therapies.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy might be most relevant for patients with advanced, progressive NETs, particularly those with limited response to somatostatin analog therapy (indicated by low DOTATOC uptake) and/or those who have failed other systemic treatments. Patients with aggressive, high-grade NETs (like G2) and significant metastatic burden may be considered.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented is preliminary. This is a Phase 2 study (NCT03034200) focusing on the mechanism of action and early clinical evaluation. The abstract does not provide patient numbers or detailed clinical outcomes. The evidence is based on preclinical models and early-phase clinical trials, and further investigation with larger, randomized controlled trials is required to establish efficacy and safety.

14. Genetic and Pharmacological Screens Converge in Identifying FLIP, BCL2, and IAP Proteins as Key Regulators of Sensitivity to the TRAIL-Inducing Anticancer Agent ONC201/TIC10.
   PMID: 25681273
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2015
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the mechanism of action and potential synergistic effects of ONC201/TIC10, a TRAIL-inducing agent, in cancer. While the study doesn’t specifically focus on neuroendocrine tumors, the identified mechanisms of sensitivity and synergy could be relevant for NET treatment, particularly given the often limited therapeutic options and potential for resistance. The findings suggest a potential avenue for combination therapy to enhance efficacy.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201/TIC10 induces TRAIL expression and cell death, and its sensitivity is linked to the levels of anti-apoptotic proteins like FLIP, BCL2, and IAP proteins.
*   Silencing KSR1, a MAPK pathway inducer, reduces expression of these anti-apoptotic proteins, enhancing ONC201 sensitivity.
*   ONC201 demonstrates synergistic effects when combined with sorafenib, leading to increased TRAIL and DR5 induction and more potent tumor regression in a hepatocellular carcinoma model.
*   The study identifies potential biomarkers (FLIP, BCL2, IAP proteins) that could predict response to ONC201.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider ONC201, potentially in combination with sorafenib, as a therapeutic option for NET patients, *particularly* if pre-treatment biomarker analysis reveals low expression of FLIP, BCL2, or IAP proteins. Further investigation is needed to determine if the synergistic effect observed with sorafenib translates to NETs. Clinical trials evaluating ONC201 in NETs are warranted.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced NETs who have progressed on standard therapies (somatostatin analogs, PRRT, everolimus) might benefit. Patients with tumors exhibiting low levels of FLIP, BCL2, and IAP proteins are most likely to respond. The study’s initial success was in hepatocellular carcinoma, so patients with NETs exhibiting similar molecular profiles might be prioritized.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is preliminary, derived from a Phase 2 study (NCT03034200) and *in vitro* and *in vivo* (mouse xenograft) experiments. The study does not include NET patients directly. The findings are promising but require validation in clinical trials specifically designed for NETs. The patient numbers in the xenograft model are limited, and the results may not fully translate to human physiology.

15. Discovery and clinical introduction of first-in-class imipridone ONC201.
   PMID: 27602582
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2016
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the discovery and early clinical development of ONC201, a novel imipridone with anti-cancer activity. While not specifically focused on NETs, the broad anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects observed across various tumor types suggest potential relevance for NET treatment, particularly in cases refractory to standard therapies. The unique mechanism of action, independent of p53 status, is noteworthy as many NETs exhibit p53 alterations.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 induces tumor cell death via upregulation of TRAIL and inactivation of Akt/ERK signaling, operating through a PERK-independent integrated stress response.
*   The drug demonstrates selective toxicity towards tumor cells, sparing normal cells in preclinical models.
*   ONC201 is orally bioavailable with infrequent dosing (every three weeks in the Phase I trial) and shows sustained pharmacodynamic effects.
*   Phase I trials indicate excellent tolerability, establishing a recommended Phase II dose of 625mg.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   ONC201 is currently being evaluated in Phase II clinical trials for various solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Given the patient’s progressive disease (metastatic well-differentiated NET with limited somatostatin receptor expression based on DOTATOC PET), consideration should be given to enrolling the patient in a clinical trial investigating ONC201, *if available for NET patients*. This is particularly relevant if other standard therapies (PRRT, Everolimus) have failed or are not suitable.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings suggest potential benefit in patients with advanced, aggressive, and refractory solid tumors, including potentially NETs. Patients with tumors exhibiting resistance to conventional therapies or those lacking suitable targets for existing treatments (like low SSTR expression) might be particularly responsive. The study doesn't specify NET subtypes, so applicability across different grades and locations needs further investigation.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented is currently limited to Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. The Phase I trial primarily focused on safety and dose determination. While the results are promising regarding tolerability and mechanism of action, efficacy data is still emerging from ongoing Phase II studies (NCT03034200). The evidence is therefore preliminary and requires confirmation in larger, randomized controlled trials.

16. Efficacy of ONC201 in Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor.
   PMID: 29626752
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2018
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication focuses on Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT), a rare sarcoma, and is of *limited* direct relevance to the presented NET patient with a small intestinal neuroendocrine tumor and liver/lymph node metastases. While both DSRCT and NET can metastasize to the liver and lymph nodes, their underlying biology and typical treatment approaches differ significantly. However, the study’s investigation of inducing apoptosis via TRAIL receptor activation with ONC201 *could* potentially be relevant if similar apoptotic pathways are dysregulated in the patient’s specific NET subtype.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201, an agonistic small molecule, induces apoptosis in DSRCT cells *in vitro*.
*   ONC201 inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft models of DSRCT.
*   Apoptosis induction was associated with caspase activation, indicating a functional apoptotic pathway.
*   The study identifies expression of TRAIL receptors (TRAILR1-4) in DSRCT, suggesting a potential vulnerability to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based *solely* on this publication, ONC201 is not a standard recommendation for this NET patient. However, further investigation into TRAIL receptor expression in *this patient’s* tumor tissue (beyond the initial DOTATOC PET) could potentially justify considering ONC201 within a clinical trial setting if receptors are present. Currently, Everolimus or PRRT remain more established treatment options given the patient’s diagnosis and staging.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with DSRCT, particularly those with progressive disease despite standard multimodal therapy (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery). The potential applicability to NET patients is currently unknown and requires further research to determine if similar TRAIL receptor expression and apoptotic pathway vulnerabilities exist.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak for NET therapy recommendations. This is a Phase 2 study (NCT03034200) focusing on DSRCT. The study utilizes *in vitro* cell lines and *in vivo* xenograft models, which may not perfectly reflect human NET biology. Patient numbers are not specified in the abstract, but Phase 2 trials generally involve a limited number of participants. Further research, ideally in NET-specific models and clinical trials, is needed to assess the efficacy and safety of ONC201 in NET patients.

17. Cancer stem cell-related gene expression as a potential biomarker of response for first-in-class imipridone ONC201 in solid tumors.
   PMID: 28767654
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the potential of ONC201, a first-in-class imipridone, as a therapy targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs). While the study primarily focuses on colorectal, prostate, and glioblastoma cancers, the underlying principle of targeting CSCs is relevant to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) as CSCs are implicated in recurrence and metastasis across various cancers, including NETs. Identifying predictive biomarkers for ONC201 response could be valuable if the drug demonstrates efficacy in NETs.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 targets self-renewing CSCs via Akt/ERK inhibition and DR5/TRAIL induction.
*   ONC201 downregulates stem cell pathways like Wnt signaling and modulates genes (ID1, ID2, ID3, ALDH7A1) involved in self-renewal.
*   Basal expression levels of CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3) correlate with ONC201 efficacy across a large panel of cancer cell lines.
*   ONC201 efficacy is lost in cells that develop resistance, and this is associated with a loss of CSC depletion.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study suggests that *prior* to initiating ONC201 treatment, assessment of CSC-related gene expression (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3) should be performed to predict potential response. If these genes are highly expressed, the patient may be more likely to benefit from ONC201. Further research is needed to determine if ONC201 is effective in NETs, but biomarker analysis could help select patients for clinical trials.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced NETs who have failed standard therapies (surgery, somatostatin analogs, PRRT) and whose tumors exhibit high expression of CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3) may be candidates for ONC201 treatment, particularly within a clinical trial setting. The study suggests potential benefit in patients *without* acquired resistance to the drug.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to Phase I/II clinical trials in solid tumors (colorectal, prostate, glioblastoma). The study itself is primarily *in vitro* and correlative, demonstrating biomarker associations. The patient number used for biomarker correlation is >1000 cancer cell lines, but clinical data directly linking gene expression to ONC201 response in patients is still emerging. This is considered preliminary evidence and requires validation in larger, prospective clinical trials specifically focused on NETs.

18. Defining Moments: Making Time for Virtual Visits and Catalyzing Better Cancer Care.
   PMID: 30907145
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication is largely *irrelevant* to direct NET therapy recommendations. The article focuses on the implementation and benefits of virtual healthcare visits for cancer patients, specifically regarding access to care and communication, and does not present any data on specific NET treatments like Everolimus or PRRT. While improved patient care and communication are important adjuncts to therapy, this study doesn’t address the core clinical question of which treatment modality is superior.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Virtual visits can improve access to expert cancer care.
* Virtual visits allow for unrushed consultations, potentially improving patient-physician communication.
* Effective implementation requires preparation before, during, and after the visit, including detailed documentation in the electronic medical record and follow-up communication via email.
* The Cleveland Clinic successfully integrated virtual visits into their cancer care pathway.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   This publication does *not* offer specific treatment recommendations for NETs, nor does it compare Everolimus to PRRT. It suggests utilizing virtual visits to *support* treatment decisions and ongoing care, but doesn’t inform *which* treatment to choose.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The benefits of virtual visits apply to all cancer patients, including those with NETs, who may benefit from increased access to specialists and more thorough communication regarding their treatment plan. This is particularly relevant for patients living far from specialized centers.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is an essay describing a clinical experience and implementation of a program at the Cleveland Clinic. It is not a clinical trial presenting data on patient outcomes. The evidence is therefore low-level, representing observational experience rather than rigorous scientific investigation. The NCT ID (NCT03034200) listed is for a Phase 2 study of ONC201, but this publication does not report on that study.

19. Phase II Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors including Pheochromocytoma-Paraganglioma and Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor.
   PMID: 35022321
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores ONC201, a DRD2 antagonist, as a potential therapy for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). While the study includes NETs, the primary focus appears to be on pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma (PC-PG) and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), making its direct relevance to the presented small intestinal NET case less strong without further data on DRD2 expression in this specific tumor type. The potential benefit hinges on DRD2 receptor expression levels within the patient’s tumor.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * ONC201 is a bitopic DRD2 antagonist, meaning it blocks dopamine-like DRD2 receptors.
* Preclinical activity of ONC201 has been demonstrated in desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT).
* The study suggests DRD2 receptor expression is higher in PC-PG compared to other cancers, implying potential for greater efficacy in this subtype.
* The abstract does not provide specific efficacy data for NETs beyond mentioning their inclusion in the study.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based solely on this publication, ONC201 *could* be considered as a potential therapeutic option *if* the patient’s small intestinal NET demonstrates significant DRD2 receptor expression. Further investigation (e.g., DRD2 receptor imaging or biopsy analysis) is crucial to determine if the tumor is likely to respond. This study does *not* provide enough evidence to favor ONC201 over established therapies like PRRT or Everolimus without that receptor expression data.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with NETs, particularly those with evidence of DRD2 receptor expression, might benefit from ONC201. The study also includes patients with PC-PG and DSRCT, suggesting potential benefit in those rarer NET subtypes. However, the abstract doesn’t specify which NET subtypes were included or how they responded.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited to a Phase II study (NCT03034200). Phase II studies are designed to assess efficacy and safety, but typically involve a smaller number of patients and are not definitive. The abstract provides no information on patient numbers, response rates, or adverse events specifically within the NET cohort. Therefore, the evidence is preliminary and requires confirmation in larger, randomized controlled trials.

   PMID: 38851203
   Study: Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET (NCT03972488)
   Publication Date: 2024
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the optimal first-line treatment for advanced, well-differentiated, grade 2-3 GEP-NETs, a category encompassing the patient’s small bowel NET with liver metastases. The study compares PRRT (Lutetium-177 Dotatate) combined with long-acting octreotide to high-dose long-acting octreotide alone, offering crucial guidance for treatment decisions.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The NETTER-2 trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus long-acting octreotide compared to high-dose long-acting octreotide alone.
* Overall Survival (OS) also trended towards improvement with the PRRT combination, although this did not reach statistical significance.
* The study showed a manageable safety profile for the PRRT combination, with hematological toxicities being the most common adverse events.
* The addition of PRRT to long-acting octreotide significantly improved the objective response rate compared to high-dose octreotide alone.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the NETTER-2 study results, first-line treatment with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in combination with long-acting octreotide is recommended for patients with newly diagnosed, advanced grade 2-3, well-differentiated GEP-NETs. This approach appears superior to high-dose long-acting octreotide alone in terms of PFS and response rate. Considering the patient’s G2 NET with liver metastases, PRRT should be strongly considered.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with newly diagnosed, advanced (metastatic), well-differentiated (G1-G3, but specifically studied in G2-G3) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The patient’s case fits this profile: a G2 small bowel NET with lymph node and liver metastases. Importantly, the study focused on patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors, which is suggested by the use of octreotide in both arms.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized controlled trial (NCT03972488). While open-label introduces potential bias, the randomized design and Phase 3 designation provide strong evidence. The study’s abstract doesn’t specify the exact patient numbers, but Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of participants, increasing the reliability of the findings. Further details regarding patient numbers and specific OS data would be needed for a complete assessment.

21. State of the art and future directions in the systemic treatment of neuroendocrine neoplasms.
   PMID: 33973550
   Study: Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET (NCT03972488)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication provides a broad overview of systemic treatment options for neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), directly addressing the clinical question of post-surgical therapy for advanced disease. While not focused on a direct comparison of Everolimus vs. PRRT, it contextualizes the treatment landscape and highlights factors influencing treatment decisions, making it relevant for this patient case. The abstract acknowledges the limited robust data available, emphasizing the need for individualized treatment approaches.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   NEN treatment efficacy is highly dependent on prognostic factors like tumor location, hormone secretion, grade, tumor burden, growth rate, somatostatin receptor expression, and FDG-avidity.
*   Systemic treatment options for advanced NENs are limited by a lack of extensive, high-quality data.
*   Somatostatin receptor expression is a crucial factor in considering therapies like PRRT (Lutetium-177 DOTATATE – Lutathera).
*   The abstract highlights the evolving nature of NEN treatment and the need for continued research.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The publication doesn’t provide a direct recommendation *between* Everolimus and PRRT. However, given the patient’s DOTATOC PET scan showing *low* somatostatin receptor uptake in liver lesions, PRRT (Lutathera) might be less effective. The abstract implicitly supports considering therapies based on receptor expression. Therefore, further investigation into the patient’s receptor status and tumor biology is crucial before deciding. Everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, may be a more appropriate initial systemic therapy in this case, particularly given the limited somatostatin receptor expression.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are relevant for patients with *advanced* GEP-NETs (like this patient with lymph node and liver metastases) who have undergone surgical resection. The abstract emphasizes the importance of considering individual patient characteristics (grade, tumor burden, receptor expression) when selecting treatment. Specifically, patients with well-differentiated (G1/G2) NETs and good somatostatin receptor expression are more likely to benefit from PRRT.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The abstract references the broader landscape of NEN treatment, acknowledging the limited robust data. The cited NCT ID (NCT03972488) refers to a Phase 3 study of Lutathera, suggesting a higher level of evidence. However, the abstract itself doesn’t present data from this study, only its existence. The overall evidence quality described in the abstract is moderate, highlighting the need for further research and individualized treatment strategies.

22. Markers of Systemic Inflammation in Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Pooled Analysis of the RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-4 Studies.
   PMID: 33560090
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the relationship between systemic inflammation markers and treatment outcomes in NET patients receiving everolimus or placebo. Understanding these biomarkers could potentially help predict response to everolimus, aiding in personalized treatment decisions for patients with advanced NETs. This is directly relevant to the clinical question of whether everolimus is the appropriate next step for this patient.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study analyzed pooled data from the RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-4 trials, investigating the impact of baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) on outcomes.
* While the abstract doesn't detail *specific* findings regarding predictive value, it establishes that systemic inflammation markers *are* associated with outcomes in NET patients treated with everolimus. Further details from the full publication would be needed to understand the direction and strength of these associations.
* The research suggests that inflammatory status at baseline might influence how patients respond to everolimus.
* Identifying patients likely to benefit from everolimus based on inflammatory markers could optimize treatment selection.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, it is recommended to consider assessing the patient’s baseline NLR and LMR *before* initiating everolimus therapy. While the abstract doesn’t provide definitive cut-offs, the full publication may reveal thresholds that correlate with response or progression. If the patient exhibits an inflammatory profile associated with poorer outcomes on everolimus (as potentially defined in the full study), PRRT might be considered as a potentially more effective first-line systemic therapy.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* neuroendocrine tumors (GI or lung origin) who are candidates for systemic therapy with either everolimus or PRRT. Specifically, patients with measurable disease and adequate performance status suitable for systemic treatment. The patient described (NET of the small intestine with lymph node and liver metastases) falls within this population.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively strong, stemming from a Phase III, pooled analysis of two large randomized controlled trials (RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-4 – NCT01524783). Phase III trials provide robust data. However, this summary is based *solely* on the abstract; the full publication is needed to assess the actual patient numbers included in the biomarker analysis and the statistical significance of the findings.

23. Impact of prior therapies on everolimus activity: an exploratory analysis of RADIANT-4.
   PMID: 29081664
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the potential benefit of everolimus in advanced NET patients, a critical consideration for the presented case with liver and lymph node metastases. The exploratory analysis of the RADIANT-4 trial provides valuable insight into how prior treatments might influence everolimus efficacy, aiding in treatment selection. This is highly relevant given the patient’s prior surgical resection and the current decision point between everolimus and PRRT.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Everolimus significantly improved median progression-free survival (PFS) by 7.1 months compared to placebo in advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional NETs.
* The study explores the impact of prior therapies (SSAs, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) on everolimus activity, suggesting potential for benefit even after prior treatment lines. (The specific impact of each prior therapy isn’t detailed in this abstract, but the analysis exists within the full publication).
* The hazard ratio (HR 0.48) indicates a substantial reduction in the risk of disease progression with everolimus.
* The p-value (<0.00001) demonstrates the statistical significance of the observed PFS benefit.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Everolimus should be strongly considered as a systemic therapy option for this patient, particularly given the well-differentiated nature of the tumor (G2). The study supports its use even after surgical resection and in the context of potential prior SSA use (although not explicitly stated in the patient history provided). A careful evaluation of the full RADIANT-4 study regarding prior therapy impact is recommended to refine the decision.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, progressive, *well-differentiated*, *non-functional* neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of gastrointestinal (GI) or lung origin. The patient’s ileal NET fits the GI origin criterion, and the G2 designation suggests well-differentiation. The non-functional aspect needs to be confirmed based on hormone levels.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, originating from a Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RADIANT-4). While this is a *post hoc* exploratory analysis, it builds upon the robust findings of the primary RADIANT-4 study. The abstract doesn’t specify the exact patient numbers included in this specific analysis, but the RADIANT-4 trial itself enrolled a substantial number of patients.
----------------------------------------

24. Everolimus in advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine tumors: RADIANT-4 lung subgroup analysis.
   PMID: 29055056
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2018
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication provides valuable data supporting the use of everolimus in advanced, progressive, well-differentiated NETs. While a subgroup analysis focusing on lung NETs, the RADIANT-4 study included patients with gastrointestinal NETs, making the findings potentially relevant to the presented patient case, particularly given the non-functional nature of the tumor.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Everolimus significantly improved median progression-free survival (PFS) by 5.6 months in the lung NET subgroup compared to placebo (9.2 vs 3.6 months).
* The hazard ratio for PFS was 0.50, indicating a substantial reduction in the risk of disease progression with everolimus.
* A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving everolimus experienced tumor shrinkage (58%) compared to placebo (13%).
* Grade 3-4 drug-related adverse events included stomatitis, hyperglycemia, and infections, requiring careful monitoring.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Everolimus, in combination with best supportive care, should be considered as a systemic therapy option for this patient with advanced, progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional small intestinal NET and liver metastases. Given the limited somatostatin receptor affinity demonstrated by the DOTATOC PET scan, PRRT may be less effective. A trial of everolimus is reasonable, particularly considering the PFS benefit demonstrated in the RADIANT-4 study.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with advanced (metastatic), progressive, well-differentiated (Grade 1 or 2), non-functional neuroendocrine tumors of either gastrointestinal or lung origin. The patient’s G2 designation and progressive disease make them a potentially suitable candidate.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, derived from a Phase III, randomized, controlled trial (RADIANT-4) with a relatively large patient cohort (n=302 overall, n=90 in the lung NET subgroup). The study utilized central radiology review for PFS assessment, enhancing the reliability of the results. However, this analysis is a *post hoc* subgroup analysis, meaning it was not the primary intention of the original study design, and should be interpreted with some caution.

25. Health-related quality of life for everolimus versus placebo in patients with advanced, non-functional, well-differentiated gastrointestinal or lung neuroendocrine tumours (RADIANT-4): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.
   PMID: 28838862
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses a relevant therapeutic question for advanced NET patients – specifically, the role of everolimus. The study provides valuable data regarding progression-free survival and, importantly, health-related quality of life, which is a crucial consideration for patients with a chronic disease like NET. It helps inform the decision-making process between systemic therapies like everolimus and other options such as PRRT.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Everolimus demonstrated increased progression-free survival compared to placebo in patients with advanced NETs.
* The study focused on *non-functional* NETs, meaning those not causing significant hormone-related symptoms.
* The RADIANT-4 trial specifically assessed health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as a secondary endpoint, showing benefit with everolimus.
* The study included both gastrointestinal and lung NETs, broadening the applicability of the findings.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Everolimus, in combination with best supportive care, should be considered as a systemic therapy option for patients with advanced, *progressive*, *non-functional*, *well-differentiated* gastrointestinal or lung NETs. The study supports its use to improve progression-free survival and maintain or improve health-related quality of life.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with advanced (metastatic) NETs originating from the gastrointestinal tract (like the patient’s small bowel NET) or the lung. Crucially, the tumors must be *well-differentiated* and *non-functional*. Patients should have progressive disease after initial treatment (in this case, surgery). The patient’s low DOTATOC uptake suggests limited somatostatin receptor expression, potentially making PRRT less effective and favoring consideration of everolimus.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong. This is a Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RADIANT-4). While the exact patient number isn’t stated in the abstract, Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of participants, providing robust statistical power. The focus on HRQOL as a secondary endpoint adds further value to the study.

26. Everolimus for the treatment of advanced, non-functional neuroendocrine tumours of the lung or gastrointestinal tract (RADIANT-4): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.
   PMID: 26703889
   Study: Everolimus Plus Best Supportive Care vs Placebo Plus Best Supportive Care in the Treatment of Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI or Lung Origin) (NCT01524783)
   Publication Date: 2016
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the systemic treatment options for advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NET), a critical need given the limited effective therapies available. The study specifically investigates everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, and its potential benefit over best supportive care in patients with progressive disease, making it highly relevant to the clinical question of whether everolimus is a suitable next step for this patient.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Everolimus significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced, non-functional NETs of lung or gastrointestinal origin.
* The study demonstrated a hazard ratio for disease progression of 0.63 (95% CI 0.48-0.82) favoring everolimus, indicating a 37% reduction in the risk of progression.
* Overall survival (OS) showed a trend towards improvement with everolimus, although this did not reach statistical significance.
* Common adverse events associated with everolimus included stomatitis, fatigue, diarrhea, and infections.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the RADIANT-4 study, everolimus should be considered as a systemic therapy option for patients with advanced, progressive, *non-functional* NETs of gastrointestinal origin, particularly when other options are limited. Given the patient’s history of surgical resection and presence of liver metastases, everolimus represents a reasonable therapeutic approach to control disease progression. A careful discussion of potential side effects is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with histologically confirmed, advanced (metastatic) NETs of either gastrointestinal or lung origin. Importantly, the study focused on *non-functional* tumors. While the benefit may extend to functional tumors, this study doesn’t provide direct evidence for that. Patients should have progressive disease after initial treatment or be unsuitable for other therapies like surgery or PRRT.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This study is a Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (NCT01524783), representing a high level of evidence. The study included a substantial number of patients (301 patients randomized 1:1 to everolimus or placebo), increasing the reliability of the findings. However, the lack of statistically significant OS improvement is a limitation.

Publications Summarized: 14

1. Angiogenesis inhibitors in neuroendocrine tumours: finally coming of age.
   PMID: 33152282
   Study: Testing Cabozantinib in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine and Carcinoid Tumors (NCT03375320)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication addresses the emerging role of angiogenesis inhibitors in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), a class of cancers including the patient’s pancreatic NET. Given the patient’s progressive disease on somatuline and consideration of Everolimus versus PRRT, exploring alternative systemic therapies like cabozantinib is highly relevant. The focus on angiogenesis inhibition offers a potential new avenue for treatment beyond somatostatin analogs and targeted therapies like mTOR inhibitors.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The review suggests angiogenesis inhibitors are “coming of age” in NET treatment, indicating increasing evidence for their efficacy.
* Angiogenesis is a crucial process in NET growth and metastasis, making it a logical therapeutic target.
* Cabozantinib, specifically, is highlighted as a potential option, though the abstract itself doesn’t detail specific findings. (The NCT ID points to a Phase III trial investigating it).
* Targeting angiogenesis can potentially overcome resistance to somatostatin analogs and other therapies.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the title and NCT ID information, cabozantinib should be considered as a potential systemic therapy option for this patient, particularly given progression on somatuline. A thorough review of the NCT03375320 trial results is crucial to assess potential benefits and risks. Comparing the potential benefits of cabozantinib to those of Everolimus and PRRT, considering the patient’s specific disease characteristics and performance status, is recommended.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* pancreatic NETs (and other NETs) who have progressed on first-line therapies like somatostatin analogs. The NCT trial specifically focuses on patients with pancreatic NETs and carcinoid tumors. Patients with measurable disease and adequate organ function are likely candidates for cabozantinib.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The referenced study (NCT03375320) is a Phase III clinical trial, indicating a relatively high level of evidence. However, the provided abstract is unavailable, so details regarding patient numbers, primary endpoints, and specific results are unknown. The strength of the evidence relies heavily on the outcomes of this Phase III trial. Further investigation of the full publication (PMID: 33152282) is essential for a complete assessment.

2. Abstracts Presented at the 13th Annual Multidisciplinary Neuroendocrine Tumor Medical Virtual Symposium of the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society, October 2-3, 2020.
   PMID: 33835977
   Study: Liposomal Irinotecan, Fluorouracil and Leucovorin in Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced High Grade Neuroendocrine Cancer of Gastrointestinal, Unknown, or Pancreatic Origin (NCT03736720)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase II study investigating a chemotherapy regimen (liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin) for advanced, refractory high-grade NETs. Given the patient’s progressing disease despite somatuline and potential refractoriness to further somatostatin analog therapy, this study is potentially relevant for consideration, particularly as PRRT and Everolimus are being weighed as next steps. However, the abstract itself provides limited detail.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study investigates a chemotherapy combination (liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin) for patients with advanced NETs.
* The study focuses on *refractory* disease, meaning patients who have already failed other treatments.
* The study includes assessment of quality of life alongside tumor response.
* The NET origin includes gastrointestinal, unknown, and importantly, *pancreatic* origins.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study explores the combination of liposomal irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin as a potential treatment option for patients with advanced, refractory high-grade NETs. While the abstract doesn’t provide efficacy data, the regimen warrants consideration in the context of progressive disease despite somatuline, and when other options like PRRT or Everolimus are being evaluated. Further investigation of the full study results is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy is relevant for patients with advanced (metastatic), high-grade (likely G2 or G3) neuroendocrine tumors of gastrointestinal, unknown, or pancreatic origin who have demonstrated disease progression despite prior therapies (refractory disease). The patient’s G2 pancreatic NET with liver metastases and progression on somatuline fits this profile.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited to a Phase II study (NCT03736720). Phase II studies are designed to assess safety and preliminary efficacy, not to confirm benefit. The abstract itself provides no data on patient numbers, response rates, or toxicity. Therefore, the evidence is preliminary and requires further investigation of the full study publication to determine the strength of the findings.

3. Ribociclib and everolimus in well-differentiated foregut neuroendocrine tumors.
   PMID: 33640871
   Study: A Study of LEE011 With Everolimus in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03070301)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses potential therapies for well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), specifically those of foregut origin, which includes pancreatic NETs like the patient’s case. While the study investigates a combination therapy, the inclusion of everolimus makes the findings relevant when considering treatment options beyond somatostatin analogs for progressive disease. The study’s negative results are equally important, informing treatment decisions by highlighting ineffective combinations.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The combination of ribociclib and everolimus demonstrated insufficient anti-tumor activity in advanced foregut WDNETs, with no objective responses observed.
* A significant proportion of patients (62%) achieved stable disease, but the median progression-free survival was only 7.7 months.
* The combination was associated with substantial toxicity, particularly hematologic (myelosuppression in 92% of the initial cohort) and infectious complications, leading to frequent treatment interruptions and dose reductions.
* No predictive biomarkers for response to the combination therapy were identified through genomic testing of tumor samples.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, the combination of ribociclib and everolimus is *not* recommended for patients with advanced, well-differentiated foregut NETs. Everolimus as a single agent remains a viable option, but the addition of ribociclib does not appear to provide benefit and significantly increases toxicity. PRRT should be strongly considered as an alternative to everolimus, given the progression on somatuline and strong somatostatin receptor expression.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, well-differentiated (G1/G2) NETs originating from the foregut (pancreas, duodenum, jejunum, etc.). The study included patients with a median age of 56, suggesting the results are likely applicable to a broad adult population.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is a Phase II, single-arm, multicenter study with a relatively small sample size (n=21). The study did not meet its pre-specified criteria for advancement to Phase III, indicating limited efficacy. While genomic analysis was performed, no predictive biomarkers were identified. The evidence is therefore moderate in strength and does not support the routine use of this combination therapy.
----------------------------------------

4. Markers of Systemic Inflammation in Neuroendocrine Tumors: A Pooled Analysis of the RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-4 Studies.
   PMID: 33560090
   Study: Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT00510068)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the relationship between systemic inflammation markers and treatment outcomes in NET patients receiving everolimus or placebo. While not directly comparing therapies, understanding predictive biomarkers for everolimus response is highly relevant when deciding between everolimus and PRRT for a patient with progressive disease on somatostatin analogs. Identifying patients likely to benefit from everolimus could optimize treatment selection.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study investigated Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) and Lymphocyte-to-Monocyte Ratio (LMR) as potential biomarkers for predicting response to everolimus in NET patients.
* While the abstract doesn’t detail specific findings, the study aims to correlate these inflammatory markers with treatment outcomes (presumably progression-free survival and overall survival).
* The analysis pooled data from RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-4, suggesting a larger dataset was used to explore these biomarker relationships.
* The study suggests systemic inflammation may play a role in NET progression and response to therapy, potentially offering a personalized medicine approach.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study doesn’t provide a direct recommendation *between* everolimus and PRRT. However, it suggests that *before* initiating everolimus, assessing NLR and LMR levels could help predict the likelihood of benefit. Patients with favorable inflammatory marker profiles (likely lower NLR and higher LMR – though the abstract doesn’t specify optimal cutoffs) might be more likely to respond to everolimus. Further investigation into the specific findings regarding NLR and LMR is needed to determine actionable thresholds.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   These findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* NETs (as indicated by the RADIANT studies) who are being considered for everolimus therapy, particularly those with progressive disease despite somatostatin analog treatment (like the patient in question). The study likely included patients with pancreatic NETs, given the context of the patient case, but the pooled analysis likely included other NET primaries.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively strong, stemming from a pooled analysis of two Phase III clinical trials (RADIANT-3 and RADIANT-4 – NCT00510068). Phase III trials generally provide robust evidence. However, this analysis focuses on *biomarkers* within those trials, not a direct comparison of therapies. The number of patients included in the pooled analysis is likely substantial, given the Phase III nature of the parent studies, but the abstract doesn’t specify the exact patient numbers.

5. Reply to V. Amoroso et al.
   PMID: 28113028
   Study: Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT00510068)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication, a reply to another study, relates to the efficacy and safety of everolimus in advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Given the patient’s progressive disease on somatuline and the clinical question of whether to proceed with everolimus or PRRT, this publication is directly relevant to treatment decision-making. However, the lack of an abstract significantly limits the information available for a thorough assessment.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study (NCT00510068) compares everolimus to placebo in advanced NET patients.
* The publication is a *reply* to another study, suggesting potential debate or further clarification regarding the original findings. Without the original study or the reply content, specific findings are unknown.
* The study investigates the efficacy of everolimus, implying a potential benefit in controlling tumor growth or improving progression-free survival.
* Safety is also assessed, indicating consideration of potential side effects associated with everolimus.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on the study design, everolimus should be considered as a potential systemic therapy option for patients with advanced NETs, particularly those demonstrating progression despite somatostatin analog treatment (as in this case). However, without the actual findings of the study, a definitive recommendation is impossible. A thorough review of the original NCT00510068 publication is crucial.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The study population consists of patients with *advanced* neuroendocrine tumors. This likely includes patients with metastatic disease, similar to the presented case with liver metastases. The suitability for everolimus would depend on performance status, prior therapies, and the specific characteristics of the tumor (e.g., grade, Ki-67 index).

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The study is a Phase III clinical trial, indicating a relatively high level of evidence. However, the provided information is limited to the NCT ID and title. The number of patients enrolled and detailed results are unknown. The fact that this is a *reply* suggests the original findings may have been nuanced or subject to debate, requiring careful consideration of the full context.

6. Everolimus for the Treatment of Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: Overall Survival and Circulating Biomarkers From the Randomized, Phase III RADIANT-3 Study.
   PMID: 27621394
   Study: Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT00510068)
   Publication Date: 2016
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the treatment of advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), a relevant subset of NETs. The RADIANT-3 study provides valuable data regarding the use of everolimus in this specific patient population, informing treatment decisions when somatostatin analogs have progressed. The study’s focus on overall survival, alongside biomarker analysis, adds to the understanding of treatment response and prognosis.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Everolimus demonstrated a median overall survival of 44.0 months compared to 37.7 months with placebo, representing a 6.3-month survival benefit. However, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.30).
* Progression-free survival was previously shown to be significantly improved with everolimus (6.4 months), suggesting a clinical benefit despite the lack of statistical significance in OS.
* Elevated baseline levels of chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, placental growth factor, and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 were associated with poorer overall survival.
* Common adverse events associated with everolimus included stomatitis, rash, and diarrhea, requiring careful management.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Everolimus should be considered as a potential treatment option for patients with advanced, progressive, low- or intermediate-grade pNET, particularly after progression on somatostatin analogs (as the patient is already on Somatuline). Biomarker assessment (chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, placental growth factor, and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1) may help in risk stratification and treatment decision-making, though these are prognostic rather than predictive of response.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced (metastatic), progressive, well-differentiated (low- or intermediate-grade) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. The study included patients who had progressed on prior somatostatin analog therapy, making it relevant for this patient’s current situation.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This study is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a relatively large patient population (n=410). However, the crossover from placebo to everolimus (85% of the placebo group eventually received everolimus) likely diluted the observed overall survival benefit and contributed to the lack of statistical significance. Despite this limitation, it represents the largest and most robust study reporting overall survival data for advanced pNET.

7. Impact of prior chemotherapy use on the efficacy of everolimus in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a subgroup analysis of the phase III RADIANT-3 trial.
   PMID: 25479584
   Study: Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT00510068)
   Publication Date: 2015
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the efficacy of everolimus in advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), which is highly relevant given the patient’s diagnosis. The study specifically examines the impact of prior chemotherapy, a factor often present in patients progressing on somatostatin analogs like the patient currently receiving Somatuline. Therefore, this study provides valuable information for deciding between everolimus and PRRT as a next-line therapy.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study is a subgroup analysis of the RADIANT-3 trial, focusing specifically on pNET patients.
* The analysis evaluates the efficacy and safety of everolimus based on whether patients had received prior chemotherapy.
* While the abstract doesn’t detail specific results, the study aims to determine if prior chemotherapy influences everolimus’ effectiveness. (Full text would be needed for specific data).
* The study confirms the importance of considering prior treatment history when selecting subsequent therapies for pNET.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study suggests that the decision to use everolimus should be made with consideration of prior chemotherapy exposure. While the abstract doesn’t provide definitive guidance on *which* patients benefit more, it highlights the need to understand this relationship. Further investigation of the full publication is crucial to determine if prior chemotherapy impacts everolimus efficacy in a way that would favor PRRT in this specific patient.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) who have progressed on somatostatin analog therapy (like the current patient) and may or may not have received prior chemotherapy. The patient’s G2 NET, presence of lymph node and liver metastases, and progression on somatuline place them within this relevant population.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, originating from a Phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RADIANT-3). However, this is a *subgroup analysis* which inherently has less statistical power than the primary trial. The abstract doesn’t provide patient numbers for the pNET subgroup, but RADIANT-3 was a large trial, suggesting a reasonable sample size within the subgroup. Access to the full publication is needed to assess the specific numbers and statistical significance of the findings.

8. Everolimus for advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
   PMID: 21306238
   Study: Efficacy and Safety of Everolimus (RAD001) Compared to Placebo in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT00510068)
   Publication Date: 2011
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the potential treatment of advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET), which is the patient’s diagnosis. Given the progression of liver metastases despite somatuline treatment, exploring alternative systemic therapies like everolimus is highly relevant to the clinical question of whether to pursue everolimus or PRRT. The study provides phase 3 data, offering a higher level of evidence than previous phase 2 studies.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, demonstrates antitumor activity in patients with advanced pNET.
* The study is a prospective, randomized, phase 3 trial evaluating everolimus versus placebo.
* While the abstract doesn’t detail specific efficacy data (PFS, OS), it confirms the agent warrants investigation in a phase 3 setting.
* The study builds upon prior phase 2 data suggesting a benefit from everolimus in this patient population.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, everolimus should be considered as a potential systemic therapy option for patients with advanced pNET, particularly those experiencing progression on somatuline. A direct comparison to PRRT isn’t provided within this publication, but the study supports further evaluation of everolimus as a viable alternative or potential combination strategy.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) – meaning those with metastatic disease, as indicated by the presence of liver metastases in this case. The study population likely includes patients with well-differentiated or moderately differentiated pNETs, though the abstract doesn’t specify grade.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, stemming from a Phase 3, randomized controlled trial (RCT). However, the abstract provides limited details regarding patient numbers, specific outcome measures (PFS, OS), and statistical significance. Full study results are needed for a comprehensive assessment, but the Phase 3 designation indicates a robust study design.

9. Efficacy and safety of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin in relapsed small cell lung cancer. Results from an expansion cohort of a phase I study.
   PMID: 33704620
   Study: Study Escalating Doses of PM01183 in Combination With Fixed Doxorubicin in Patients With Specific Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors (NCT01970540)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase I study evaluating lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin for relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). While the study focuses on SCLC, the potential activity of lurbinectedin, a DNA damaging agent, warrants consideration for investigation in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) particularly those progressing on somatostatin analogs, as NETs can exhibit varying degrees of chemosensitivity and may benefit from novel cytotoxic approaches. However, direct extrapolation to NET treatment is currently unsupported by this study.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The combination of doxorubicin and lurbinectedin demonstrated a 36% overall response rate (ORR) in relapsed SCLC patients.
* Patients with sensitive disease (longer chemotherapy-free interval) had a significantly higher ORR (50%) and improved PFS/OS compared to those with resistant disease.
* The primary toxicity observed was manageable myelosuppression, with non-hematological toxicities being mostly mild to moderate.
* The combination showed noteworthy activity and a manageable safety profile, leading to evaluation in a Phase III trial for SCLC.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on these findings, lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin *could* be considered as an investigational option for patients with progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic NET who have failed somatostatin analog therapy (like the patient in question) and are eligible for chemotherapy. This should only be pursued within the context of a clinical trial or with strong consideration of the potential risks and benefits. It is *not* a standard of care recommendation at this time. Further research specifically in NET populations is needed.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The study focused on patients with relapsed SCLC after one prior line of chemotherapy. Extrapolating to NET, potential candidates would be patients with progressive, unresectable NET (specifically pancreatic NET in this case, given the patient context) who have demonstrated progression despite somatostatin analog therapy and have adequate performance status to tolerate chemotherapy. Patients with sensitive disease (longer interval since last treatment) may be more likely to benefit.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to a Phase I expansion cohort study (NCT01970540) with 28 patients. While the results are promising in SCLC, the evidence is weak for NETs as this study did not include NET patients. The findings are preliminary and require confirmation in larger, dedicated clinical trials specifically designed for NET populations.

10. Observational Study in a Real-World Setting of Targeted Therapy in the Systemic Treatment of Progressive Unresectable or Metastatic Well-Differentiated Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (pNETs) in France: OPALINE Study.
   PMID: 35419649
   Study: OPALINE : A Study Of Morbidity And Mortality At 2 Years (NCT02264665)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the therapeutic options for progressive, unresectable or metastatic well-differentiated pancreatic NETs (pNETs), the patient’s specific diagnosis. The OPALINE study provides real-world data comparing targeted therapies (sunitinib and everolimus) to standard-of-care treatments, offering valuable insights for treatment decisions when somatostatin analogues like octreotide/lanreotide (Somatuline) demonstrate progression.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study compares sunitinib and everolimus to previously recommended treatments (chemotherapies and somatostatin analogues) in a real-world setting.
* The study was conducted *after* approval of sunitinib and everolimus in France, evaluating their efficacy in routine clinical practice.
* The abstract doesn’t present specific efficacy data (PFS, OS, ORR) but confirms the study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the targeted therapies.
* The study focuses on well-differentiated pNETs, a crucial distinction as treatment approaches can vary based on differentiation grade.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study investigates both everolimus and sunitinib as potential alternatives to chemotherapy and continued somatostatin analogue therapy in patients with progressive disease despite somatostatin analogue treatment. Given the patient’s progression on Somatuline and the availability of both options, a careful consideration of potential side effect profiles and patient comorbidities is warranted when choosing between everolimus and sunitinib. The study doesn’t definitively favor one over the other based on the abstract alone.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with progressive, unresectable or metastatic *well-differentiated* pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) who have experienced disease progression despite treatment with somatostatin analogues. The patient’s G2 NET with liver and lymph node metastases fits this profile.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The study is an observational, real-world study (N/A phase designation). This means it lacks the rigorous control of a randomized controlled trial. While providing valuable insights into clinical practice, the evidence strength is moderate. The NCT ID (NCT02264665) suggests a larger cohort, but the abstract doesn’t provide patient numbers. Further investigation of the full publication is needed to assess the sample size and detailed results.

11. Phase I Study of Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 Inhibitor, CC-90011, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
   PMID: 33046517
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced solid tumors, which *could* have relevance for NET treatment given the role of LSD1 in cancer stem cells and potential chemoresistance – a common issue in progressive NET disease. However, the study doesn’t specifically focus on NETs, and the relevance is currently exploratory, based on the mechanistic rationale of LSD1 inhibition. Further research specifically in NETs is needed to confirm benefit.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   CC-90011 is a potent, selective, and reversible oral LSD1 inhibitor.
*   LSD1 expression in cancer stem cells is associated with chemoresistance, suggesting a potential mechanism for overcoming treatment resistance.
*   The study evaluated CC-90011 in patients with advanced solid tumors *and* relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, indicating a broad exploratory approach.
*   The study is a Phase I trial, primarily focused on safety and dose escalation, with limited efficacy data presented in the abstract.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this Phase I study *alone*, CC-90011 cannot be routinely recommended for the patient. However, considering the progression on somatuline and the question of Everolimus vs. PRRT, CC-90011 *could* be considered within a clinical trial setting, particularly if the patient’s tumor demonstrates characteristics suggesting LSD1 involvement (this would require biomarker analysis). It is not a standard-of-care option at this time.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are potentially relevant for patients with advanced solid tumors, including NETs, who have relapsed or are refractory to standard therapies (like somatuline in this case). Patients with evidence of chemoresistance or a high proportion of cancer stem cells *might* be more likely to benefit, but this requires further investigation.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is very low. This is a Phase I study, meaning it primarily assesses safety and determines a recommended dose. Patient numbers are likely small, and efficacy data are preliminary and not the primary focus of this phase. The study does not provide conclusive evidence of benefit in any tumor type, including NETs.
----------------------------------------

12. Clinical activity of CC-90011, an oral, potent, and reversible LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies.
   PMID: 35737639
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the Phase 1 study of CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies, including some hematological cancers. While not specifically focused on NETs, LSD1 inhibition is a potential epigenetic approach to cancer therapy and may offer a novel avenue for NET treatment, particularly in cases progressing on somatostatin analogs like the patient in question. Further research is needed to determine efficacy in NETs specifically.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * CC-90011 demonstrates clinical activity in advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma.
* The drug is an oral, potent, selective, and reversible inhibitor of LSD1.
* CC-90011 was well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study, suggesting a manageable safety profile.
* The study provides long-term safety and efficacy data, alongside pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic insights.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this Phase 1 data, CC-90011 *could* be considered in the context of clinical trials for patients with progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic NETs (G2) with liver metastases who have failed somatostatin analog therapy (like the presented case). It is *not* a standard of care recommendation at this time. Exploration within a research setting is warranted to assess its potential benefit in this specific NET subtype. Given the progression on Somatuline and positive DOTATOC PET, exploring novel therapies is reasonable.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced solid tumors, including potentially NETs, who have relapsed or are refractory to standard therapies. The study included patients with various advanced malignancies, suggesting a broad potential applicability, but specific NET data is lacking. Patients with progressing disease despite somatostatin analog treatment are the most relevant subgroup for consideration.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is limited. This is a Phase 1 study, primarily focused on safety and dose escalation. While encouraging activity was observed, the patient numbers are small, and the study does not provide definitive evidence of efficacy. Further investigation in Phase 2 and 3 trials, specifically designed for NET patients, is required to establish the role of CC-90011 in NET treatment.
----------------------------------------

13. Phase 1 safety and pharmacodynamic study of lenalidomide combined with everolimus in patients with advanced solid malignancies with efficacy signal in adenoid cystic carcinoma.
   PMID: 32704173
   Study: Study of Everolimus (RAD001) in Combination With Lenalidomide (NCT01218555)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the combination of lenalidomide and everolimus, a regimen potentially relevant for NET patients, particularly those progressing on somatostatin analogs like the patient in question. While the study wasn’t specifically conducted in NET patients, the rationale for combining a mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) with an immunomodulatory drug (lenalidomide) to enhance cytotoxicity is a promising avenue for investigation in NET treatment, especially given the limited options for progressive disease.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The combination of lenalidomide and everolimus was assessed for safety and pharmacodynamic effects in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
* The study demonstrated enhanced preclinical cytotoxicity with the combination, suggesting a synergistic effect.
* While primarily a safety and pharmacokinetic study, an efficacy signal was observed in adenoid cystic carcinoma, indicating potential anti-tumor activity.
* The study provides data on the tolerability of the combination, which is crucial for future clinical trials.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progression on somatuline and the presence of liver metastases, the lenalidomide/everolimus combination *could* be considered as a potential therapeutic option, particularly in the absence of other suitable alternatives like PRRT (given the strong somatostatin receptor expression). However, this should be done within the context of a clinical trial or with careful consideration of the limited data available specifically for NETs. Further investigation is warranted to determine the efficacy of this combination in pancreatic NETs.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This combination might be relevant for patients with advanced, progressive NETs who have failed first-line therapies (like somatostatin analogs) and are candidates for systemic treatment. Patients with good performance status and adequate organ function are preferred. The observed efficacy signal in adenoid cystic carcinoma suggests potential benefit in tumors with similar biological characteristics, though this needs to be confirmed in NETs.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is low. This is a Phase 1 study with a primary focus on safety and pharmacokinetics. Patient numbers are likely small, and the efficacy data is preliminary and derived from a heterogeneous population of advanced solid tumor patients, with only an efficacy signal observed in adenoid cystic carcinoma. Further studies, ideally Phase II or III trials specifically designed for NET patients, are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of this combination.
----------------------------------------

14. Randomized Study of Temozolomide or Temozolomide and Capecitabine in Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (ECOG-ACRIN E2211).
   PMID: 36260828
   Study: Temozolomide With or Without Capecitabine in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT01824875)
   Publication Date: 2023
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses treatment options for advanced pancreatic NETs, a critical need given the limited effective therapies available. The study investigates a chemotherapy combination (temozolomide +/- capecitabine) which could be considered as an alternative or addition to current standard of care options like somatostatin analogs and PRRT, particularly in cases of progressive disease. Therefore, it’s highly relevant to the clinical question regarding further therapy for this patient.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The study suggests that temozolomide, with or without capecitabine, demonstrates potential activity in advanced pancreatic NETs.
* Retrospective data and small prospective studies indicated high response rates (RRs) and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) with this combination.
* The study is a randomized Phase II trial designed to formally evaluate these findings.
* While the full results aren’t detailed in the abstract, the study aims to confirm the promising signals seen in prior, smaller studies.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study investigates two treatment arms: temozolomide alone or temozolomide combined with capecitabine. Based on the rationale and preliminary data cited, consideration should be given to either regimen in patients with progressive disease despite somatostatin analog therapy (as is the case here). Further details from the full publication are needed to determine which arm demonstrates superior efficacy and tolerability.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy is relevant for patients with *advanced* pancreatic NETs, specifically those who have progressed on or are ineligible for other standard therapies (like somatostatin analogs). The patient described (NET of the pancreas with lymph node and liver metastases, progressing on somatuline) falls within this population. Patients with good performance status are generally better candidates for chemotherapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently moderate. This is a Phase II randomized study (NCT01824875, ECOG-ACRIN E2211), which is designed to assess activity and safety, but not definitive efficacy. The abstract doesn’t provide patient numbers or detailed results. Phase II studies are hypothesis-generating and require confirmation with larger, Phase III trials.

PATIENT 5
========================================
Publications Summarized: 14

1. Efficacy and safety of lurbinectedin and doxorubicin in relapsed small cell lung cancer. Results from an expansion cohort of a phase I study.
   PMID: 33704620
   Study: Study Escalating Doses of PM01183 in Combination With Fixed Doxorubicin in Patients With Specific Advanced Unresectable Solid Tumors (NCT01970540)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase I study evaluating lurbinectedin and doxorubicin in relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC). While the study focuses on SCLC, the mechanism of action of lurbinectedin (DNA damaging agent) and potential synergy with doxorubicin *could* be explored in NETs, particularly those with limited somatostatin receptor expression or resistance to standard therapies like somatostatin analogs or PRRT. However, direct extrapolation to NET treatment is currently unsupported by this study.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The combination of doxorubicin (40mg/m2) and lurbinectedin (2.0mg/m2) every 3 weeks demonstrated a 36% overall response rate (ORR) in relapsed SCLC.
* Patients with sensitive disease (longer chemotherapy-free interval) had a significantly higher ORR (50%) and improved PFS/OS compared to those with resistant disease (10% ORR).
* The primary toxicity observed was manageable myelosuppression, with non-hematological toxicities generally mild to moderate.
* The combination is being further investigated in a Phase III trial for SCLC, suggesting promising initial results.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Currently, this combination is *not* a standard recommendation for NET treatment. However, in highly selected patients with progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic NETs who have exhausted somatostatin analog and PRRT options, and who have a good performance status, consideration of this regimen *within a clinical trial* could be explored. This would require careful assessment of potential benefits versus risks.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant to patients with advanced, relapsed NETs who have limited treatment options, particularly those with tumors that are not highly somatostatin receptor positive or have developed resistance to somatostatin analog therapy. Patients should have adequate bone marrow reserve and organ function to tolerate chemotherapy. The study population in this paper had relapsed SCLC after one prior line of chemotherapy.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to a Phase I expansion cohort study (N=28) in SCLC patients. While the results are promising in that context, they do not directly translate to NET treatment. The study demonstrates initial activity and safety, but further investigation in NET-specific trials is necessary to determine efficacy and optimal dosing. The ongoing Phase III trial in SCLC may provide further insights, but its relevance to NETs remains uncertain.
----------------------------------------

2. Phase I Study of Lysine-Specific Demethylase 1 Inhibitor, CC-90011, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors and Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.
   PMID: 33046517
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details a Phase I study of CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor. While not specifically focused on NETs, LSD1 is a potential therapeutic target in various cancers, including those exhibiting chemoresistance, which can be a challenge in advanced NETs. Therefore, the study provides preliminary data that *could* inform future NET treatment strategies, particularly in cases of progressive disease despite standard therapies.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * CC-90011 is a potent, selective, and reversible oral LSD1 inhibitor.
* The study investigated CC-90011 in patients with advanced solid tumors *and* relapsed/refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, suggesting a broad potential application.
* LSD1 expression in cancer stem cells is linked to chemoresistance, indicating CC-90011 might overcome resistance mechanisms.
* The study primarily focused on safety and dose escalation, with limited efficacy data reported in the abstract.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this Phase I study, CC-90011 is *not* currently a standard recommendation for NET treatment. However, given the patient’s progressive disease (metastases to lymph nodes and liver) and strong somatostatin receptor expression (DOTATOC PET positive), exploring CC-90011 in a clinical trial setting *could* be considered if other options (Somatuline, PRRT, chemotherapy) have failed or are not suitable. This is a highly experimental approach at this stage.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are potentially relevant for patients with advanced NETs, particularly those who have relapsed or become refractory to standard therapies like somatostatin analogs (e.g., Somatuline) and PRRT. Patients with evidence of chemoresistance or a high proportion of cancer stem cells might be more likely to benefit, though this requires further investigation.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is very low. This is a Phase I study, meaning it primarily assesses safety and dose-limiting toxicities in a small number of patients. Efficacy data is limited. The study does not provide conclusive evidence of benefit and requires further investigation in larger, Phase II and III trials specifically focused on NETs.
----------------------------------------

3. Clinical activity of CC-90011, an oral, potent, and reversible LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies.
   PMID: 35737639
   Study: A Safety and Efficacy Study of CC-90011 in Participants With Relapsed and/or Refractory Solid Tumors and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NCT02875223)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the Phase 1 study of CC-90011, an LSD1 inhibitor, in advanced malignancies, including some hematological cancers. While not directly focused on NETs, LSD1 inhibition is a potential therapeutic strategy being explored in various cancers, and its activity in other advanced cancers warrants investigation for potential benefit in NETs, particularly those progressing despite standard therapies. The strong somatostatin receptor expression in the patient’s tumor (DOTATOC PET) doesn’t directly relate to LSD1 inhibition, but highlights the need for considering multiple therapeutic avenues.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * CC-90011 demonstrates clinical activity in advanced solid tumors and relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma.
* The drug is orally bioavailable, potent, selective, and reversible in its inhibition of LSD1.
* CC-90011 was well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study, suggesting a manageable safety profile.
* Long-term follow-up reveals sustained activity and further pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data supporting continued investigation.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Given the patient’s progressive disease (NET of the pancreas with lymph node and liver metastases) and potential for limited benefit from standard therapies (Somatuline/PRRT), considering participation in clinical trials evaluating LSD1 inhibitors like CC-90011 could be a reasonable option. This should be discussed within a multidisciplinary tumor board. Currently, CC-90011 is *not* a standard of care and is only available through clinical trials.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy might be relevant for patients with advanced NETs (like this pancreatic NET case) who have progressed on or are ineligible for standard therapies like somatostatin analogs (e.g., Octreotide, Lanreotide) and PRRT. Patients with aggressive, rapidly progressing disease may be prioritized, but further research is needed to identify predictive biomarkers for response.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently low. This is a Phase 1 study, primarily focused on safety and dose escalation. While encouraging activity was observed, the patient numbers are small, and the efficacy data are preliminary. Further investigation in Phase 2 and 3 trials is required to determine the true therapeutic potential of CC-90011 in NETs.

4. Updated Efficacy and Safety Outcomes for Patients with Well-Differentiated Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors Treated with Sunitinib.
   PMID: 33411058
   Study: A Study Of The Efficacy And Safety Of Sunitinib In Patients With Advanced Well-Differentiated Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT01525550)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses potential treatment options for patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs), which aligns with the clinical question regarding further therapy for the patient with metastatic disease. The study investigates sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, as a potential systemic treatment option beyond somatostatin analogs and PRRT. Therefore, it’s highly relevant for informing treatment decisions in this case.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Sunitinib demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with metastatic panNETs.
* The efficacy of sunitinib was confirmed in an open-label phase IV trial, building upon initial phase III findings.
* The study provides further evidence supporting sunitinib as a viable systemic therapy option for advanced panNETs.
* While the abstract doesn’t detail specific response rates or overall survival benefits, the PFS improvement is a clinically meaningful outcome.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Sunitinib should be considered as a systemic therapy option for patients with advanced, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, particularly after disease progression on or intolerance to first-line somatostatin analog therapy. The study suggests it can prolong PFS. A discussion of potential benefits versus risks should be undertaken with the patient.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with *metastatic*, *well-differentiated* pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (panNETs). The patient described (NET des Pankreas mit Lymphknoten und Lebermetastasen, G2) falls within this population. Patients who have progressed on somatostatin analog therapy or are intolerant to it are particularly suitable candidates.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is moderately strong. The study is a Phase IV, open-label trial, confirming results from a prior Phase III trial. While Phase IV trials provide real-world data, the open-label design introduces potential bias. The abstract does not provide patient numbers, making a precise assessment of statistical power difficult. Further details regarding patient characteristics and response rates would strengthen the evidence base.

5. Dual inactivation of Akt and ERK by TIC10 signals Foxo3a nuclear translocation, TRAIL gene induction, and potent antitumor effects.
   PMID: 23390247
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2013
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the preclinical activity of TIC10, a small molecule inducing TRAIL expression, and its potential as an antitumor agent. While not directly studied in NET patients in this publication, the mechanism of action – inducing apoptosis via the TRAIL pathway – is relevant to NET therapy, as NETs can be sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. The study offers a potential novel therapeutic avenue, particularly given the patient’s somatostatin receptor positivity (indicated by DOTATOC PET) suggesting potential responsiveness to therapies modulating cellular signaling.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   TIC10 is an orally active small molecule that induces TRAIL expression in tumor cells, independent of p53 status.
*   TIC10 inactivates Akt and ERK kinases, leading to Foxo3a nuclear translocation and subsequent upregulation of the TRAIL gene.
*   TIC10 demonstrates antitumor activity by enhancing endogenous TRAIL concentrations within the tumor and its microenvironment.
*   TIC10 crosses the blood-brain barrier, suggesting potential efficacy against brain metastases, a common concern in NET progression.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   TIC10, or similar compounds targeting the Akt/ERK pathway to induce TRAIL expression, should be considered for investigation in NET patients, particularly those with progressive disease despite somatostatin analog treatment or PRRT. Further research, including clinical trials, is needed to determine its efficacy and safety in this patient population. Combination therapy with existing NET treatments (somatostatin analogs, PRRT) could be explored to potentially enhance antitumor effects.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This approach may be most relevant for patients with NETs that exhibit resistance to conventional therapies (somatostatin analogs, chemotherapy). Patients with tumors showing evidence of Akt/ERK pathway activation might be particularly responsive. The potential for blood-brain barrier penetration makes it potentially valuable for patients with brain metastases.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented is from a preclinical study (in vitro and in vivo models). The publication (PMID: 23390247) does not report on human clinical trials. The NCT ID (NCT03034200) refers to a Phase 2 study of ONC201 (likely related to TIC10), suggesting some clinical investigation is underway, but the results are not presented in this publication. Therefore, the evidence is currently weak and requires confirmation through robust clinical trials (Phase II and III) with adequate patient numbers.
----------------------------------------

6. Identification of TRAIL-inducing compounds highlights small molecule ONC201/TIC10 as a unique anti-cancer agent that activates the TRAIL pathway.
   PMID: 25927855
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2015
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the preclinical rationale for ONC201/TIC10, a small molecule inducing the TRAIL pathway, as a potential anti-cancer agent. While not specifically focused on NETs, the activation of the TRAIL pathway represents a novel therapeutic approach that could be relevant for NET patients, particularly those with somatostatin receptor expression (given the patient’s positive DOTATOC PET scan suggesting potential sensitivity to targeted therapies). Exploring alternative pathways beyond somatostatin analogs and PRRT is crucial for patients with progressive disease.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * ONC201/TIC10 is a small molecule that induces the expression of the TRAIL gene.
* TRAIL is a protein that can trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells.
* ONC201/TIC10 aims to overcome limitations associated with directly administering recombinant TRAIL.
* Preclinical models demonstrated promising safety and antitumor efficacy with ONC201/TIC10.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Considering the patient’s progressive disease (metastases to lymph nodes and liver) and strong somatostatin receptor expression, ONC201/TIC10 should be considered as a potential investigational therapy, *particularly within the context of a clinical trial*. It should *not* replace standard-of-care treatments like somatostatin analogs or PRRT unless those have failed or are not feasible. Further investigation into the efficacy of ONC201/TIC10 in combination with existing NET therapies is warranted.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This therapy may be relevant for patients with advanced NETs, particularly those who have progressed on or are intolerant to first-line therapies like somatostatin analogs and PRRT. The study doesn't specify receptor status as a requirement, but given the mechanism of action and the patient’s positive DOTATOC scan, patients with high somatostatin receptor expression might be more likely to respond. Patients with measurable disease are ideal for assessing response.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented is preliminary, stemming from a Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03034200) and prior preclinical studies. The publication focuses on the mechanism of action and early clinical development. The abstract does not provide patient numbers or detailed efficacy data. Therefore, the evidence is currently limited and requires further investigation in larger, randomized controlled trials to establish efficacy and safety.

7. Genetic and Pharmacological Screens Converge in Identifying FLIP, BCL2, and IAP Proteins as Key Regulators of Sensitivity to the TRAIL-Inducing Anticancer Agent ONC201/TIC10.
   PMID: 25681273
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2015
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the mechanism of action and potential synergistic effects of ONC201, a TRAIL-inducing agent, in cancer. While the study doesn’t directly focus on NETs, the identified pathways regulating ONC201 sensitivity and synergy with sorafenib could be relevant given the potential for TRAIL-based therapies in NET treatment and the frequent resistance mechanisms observed. The findings suggest potential strategies to overcome resistance and enhance efficacy of ONC201.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 sensitivity is regulated by anti-apoptotic proteins like FLIP, BCL2, and IAP proteins. Identifying patients with lower expression of these proteins may predict better response.
*   ONC201 synergizes with sorafenib, leading to increased TRAIL and DR5 expression and enhanced cell death.
*   KSR1 silencing impacts ONC201 sensitivity by reducing anti-apoptotic protein expression, not through MAPK signaling.
*   The combination of ONC201 and sorafenib demonstrated tumor regressions in a hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft model with a favorable safety profile.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Consider investigating ONC201, potentially in combination with sorafenib, as a therapeutic option for NET patients, *particularly* those who have progressed on or are refractory to somatostatin analogs (SSAs) or PRRT. Biomarker analysis for FLIP, BCL2, and IAP protein expression should be considered to identify patients most likely to respond. Further research is needed to determine if the synergistic effect with sorafenib translates to NETs.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced, progressive NETs, particularly those with limited response to standard therapies (SSAs, PRRT), may benefit. Patients with lower expression levels of FLIP, BCL2, and IAP proteins are hypothesized to be more responsive. The study’s initial success in hepatocellular carcinoma suggests potential benefit in patients with aggressive NET subtypes.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to a Phase 2 study (NCT03034200) and preclinical data (mouse xenograft model). The study does not include NET patients directly. The findings are based on *in vitro* and *in vivo* experiments in other cancer types, requiring further validation in NET-specific models and clinical trials. The patient numbers within the cited publication are not specified, but the study is a Phase 2 trial, suggesting a limited number of participants.

8. Discovery and clinical introduction of first-in-class imipridone ONC201.
   PMID: 27602582
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2016
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication details the discovery and early clinical testing of ONC201, a novel imipridone with anti-cancer activity. While not specifically focused on NETs, the broad anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects observed across various tumor types suggest potential relevance for NET treatment, particularly in cases refractory to standard therapies like somatostatin analogs or PRRT. The unique mechanism of action, independent of p53 status, is noteworthy as NETs often exhibit p53 alterations.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 induces tumor cell death via upregulation of TRAIL (a death ligand) and inactivation of Akt/ERK signaling pathways, independent of p53.
*   The drug demonstrates anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects against a broad range of tumor cells while sparing normal cells in preclinical studies.
*   ONC201 is orally bioavailable with infrequent dosing and appears to be well-tolerated in initial human trials.
*   A recommended Phase II dose of 625mg every three weeks has been established based on preclinical efficacy and human tolerability.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this publication, ONC201 should be considered for investigation as a potential treatment option in advanced NET patients, particularly those who have progressed on or are refractory to somatostatin analogs and PRRT. Clinical trials evaluating ONC201 as a single agent or in combination with other therapies are ongoing and represent the most appropriate next step. Given the patient’s positive DOTATOC PET scan, standard therapies should be exhausted before considering ONC201.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with advanced, aggressive, and refractory solid tumors, including potentially NETs. The study doesn’t specify NET subtypes, but the broad activity suggests it *could* be relevant for both pancreatic and other NETs. Patients with progressive disease despite standard therapies (somatostatin analogs, PRRT) are the most suitable candidates for potential inclusion in clinical trials evaluating ONC201.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence presented is preliminary. This publication describes Phase 2 clinical trials (NCT03034200) and preclinical data. While the Phase 1 trial demonstrated good tolerability and established a recommended Phase 2 dose, efficacy data are still emerging. The evidence is therefore considered moderate, and further investigation through larger, randomized controlled trials is required to determine the true therapeutic potential of ONC201 in NET patients.

9. Efficacy of ONC201 in Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor.
   PMID: 29626752
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2018
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication focuses on Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT), a rare sarcoma, and is of *limited* direct relevance to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) with liver and lymph node metastases. While both DSRCT and pNET can metastasize to the liver and lymph nodes, they are fundamentally different tumor types with distinct molecular drivers. However, the study’s investigation into inducing apoptosis via TRAIL receptor activation with ONC201 *could* potentially be explored as a therapeutic strategy in NETs, warranting further investigation if NETs demonstrate similar TRAIL receptor expression.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201, an agonistic small molecule, induces apoptosis in DSRCT cells *in vitro*.
*   ONC201 inhibited cell proliferation and tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft models of DSRCT.
*   Apoptosis induction was associated with caspase activation, confirming the mechanism of action.
*   DSRCT cells express TRAIL receptors (TRAILR1-4), making them susceptible to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis induced by ONC201.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based *solely* on this study, ONC201 is not a recommended therapy for pNET. However, *preclinical* investigation into TRAIL receptor expression in pNET cells and the potential efficacy of ONC201 in pNET cell lines and animal models should be considered. This study does *not* provide evidence to support its use in clinical practice for pNET at this time. The current standard of care (Somatuline/PRRT) should be prioritized.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are relevant to patients diagnosed with Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor (DSRCT), particularly those with metastatic disease who have not responded adequately to conventional therapies (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery). It is *not* directly applicable to pNET patients.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is relatively weak for pNET therapy recommendations. This is a Phase 2 study (NCT03034200) focusing on DSRCT. While the *in vitro* and *in vivo* data are promising for DSRCT, there is no evidence presented regarding the efficacy or safety of ONC201 in neuroendocrine tumors. Further preclinical studies are needed before clinical trials in NET patients could be considered.

10. Cancer stem cell-related gene expression as a potential biomarker of response for first-in-class imipridone ONC201 in solid tumors.
   PMID: 28767654
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2017
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores the potential of ONC201, a first-in-class imipridone, as a therapy targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs). While the study primarily focuses on colorectal, prostate, and glioblastoma cancers, the principle of targeting CSCs is relevant to NETs, as CSCs are implicated in recurrence, metastasis, and poor survival across various cancers, including NETs. The identification of predictive biomarkers for ONC201 response could be valuable in selecting NET patients most likely to benefit from this therapy.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   ONC201 targets CSCs via Akt/ERK inhibition and DR5/TRAIL induction, leading to reduced self-renewal.
*   ONC201 modulates key stem cell pathways like Wnt signaling and downregulates genes (ID1, ID2, ID3, ALDH7A1) involved in self-renewal.
*   Basal expression levels of CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3) correlate with ONC201 efficacy across a large panel of cancer cell lines.
*   Acquired resistance to ONC201 can lead to a loss of CSC depletion, suggesting biomarker monitoring during treatment is important.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   Based on this study, consideration should be given to evaluating CSC-related gene expression (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3) in the patient’s tumor prior to initiating ONC201 therapy. If high expression of these genes is observed, ONC201 may be a viable treatment option. Monitoring CSC-related gene expression during treatment could help identify developing resistance and inform treatment adjustments. Currently, ONC201 is being investigated in a Phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03034200) and participation in such trials should be considered.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   Patients with advanced NETs, particularly those with evidence of metastasis (as in this case with liver and lymph node involvement), might benefit from ONC201 if their tumors exhibit high expression of CSC-related genes (ID1, CD44, HES7, TCF3). The study suggests potential benefit across different tumor types, so NET patients should not be excluded *a priori*.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to Phase 1/2 clinical trials and *in vitro* studies. The study demonstrates proof-of-concept findings and identifies potential biomarkers, but larger, randomized, controlled Phase 3 trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of ONC201 in NET patients. The biomarker correlations were observed in >1000 cancer cell lines, providing some robustness, but clinical validation is crucial.

11. Defining Moments: Making Time for Virtual Visits and Catalyzing Better Cancer Care.
   PMID: 30907145
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2020
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication is largely *irrelevant* to direct NET therapy recommendations. The article focuses on the implementation and benefits of virtual healthcare visits for cancer patients, specifically regarding communication and access to care, not on novel treatments or efficacy data for NETs. While improved patient care and communication are important adjuncts to therapy, this paper doesn’t address the core clinical question of Somatuline versus PRRT for this patient.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * Virtual visits can improve access to expert cancer care.
* Virtual visits allow for unrushed, informative consultations with physicians.
* Effective virtual visits require preparation, clear communication during the visit, and thorough documentation in the electronic medical record with follow-up information via email.
* The Cleveland Clinic successfully integrated virtual visits into their cancer care pathway.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   This publication does *not* provide specific treatment recommendations for NETs. It suggests utilizing virtual visits to *support* treatment decisions and ongoing care, but does not evaluate or compare therapies like Somatuline or PRRT. It advocates for better communication *around* treatment, not the treatment itself.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The benefits of virtual visits apply to all cancer patients, including those with NETs, who may benefit from increased access to specialists and more convenient follow-up care. This is particularly relevant for patients who live far from specialized centers or have difficulty traveling.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   This is an essay describing a clinical experience (implementation of a program) at the Cleveland Clinic, not a clinical trial. There are no patient numbers reported related to efficacy or outcomes. The evidence is based on observational experience and is of very low strength regarding NET therapy itself. The referenced NCT ID (NCT03034200) is for a study of ONC201, but this publication does not discuss the results of that study.
----------------------------------------

12. Phase II Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors including Pheochromocytoma-Paraganglioma and Desmoplastic Small Round Cell Tumor.
   PMID: 35022321
   Study: Phase 2 Study of ONC201 in Neuroendocrine Tumors (NCT03034200)
   Publication Date: 2022
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication explores ONC201, a DRD2 antagonist, as a potential therapy for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). While the study includes NETs, the primary focus appears to be on pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma (PC-PG) and desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), making its direct relevance to pancreatic NETs less clear without further data on DRD2 expression in this specific subtype. However, exploring novel targets is valuable, and DRD2 expression could potentially be a biomarker for ONC201 response in *some* NET patients.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * ONC201 is a bitopic DRD2 antagonist, meaning it blocks dopamine-like receptors.
* Preclinical activity of ONC201 has been demonstrated in desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT).
* DRD2 receptor expression is higher in PC-PG compared to other cancers, suggesting potential for greater efficacy in this subtype.
* The study investigates ONC201 in a broader range of NETs, but specific results for pancreatic NETs are not detailed in the abstract.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The study investigates ONC201 as a potential therapeutic option for NETs. However, based solely on this abstract, a direct recommendation for this specific pancreatic NET patient is *not* possible. Further investigation into DRD2 expression levels in the patient’s tumor (via immunohistochemistry or similar methods) is crucial before considering ONC201. If DRD2 expression is high, ONC201 could be considered within a clinical trial setting.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The study population includes patients with various NETs, including PC-PG and DSRCT. For this pancreatic NET patient, suitability depends entirely on DRD2 expression levels in their tumor. Patients with high DRD2 expression are more likely to benefit.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is currently limited to a Phase II study (NCT03034200). Phase II studies are designed to assess efficacy and safety, but are not definitive. The abstract does not provide patient numbers, response rates, or detailed safety data. Therefore, the evidence is preliminary and requires confirmation in larger, Phase III trials.

13. [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus long-acting octreotide versus high&#x2011;dose long-acting octreotide for the treatment of newly diagnosed, advanced grade 2-3, well-differentiated, gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETTER-2): an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study.
   PMID: 38851203
   Study: Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET (NCT03972488)
   Publication Date: 2024
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication directly addresses the optimal first-line treatment for advanced, well-differentiated, grade 2-3 GEP-NETs, a category encompassing the patient’s pancreatic NET with lymph node and liver metastases. The study compares PRRT (Lutetium-177 Dotatate) combined with maintenance octreotide LAR to high-dose octreotide LAR alone, offering crucial guidance for treatment selection.

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   *   The NETTER-2 trial demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in Progression-Free Survival (PFS) with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE plus long-acting octreotide compared to high-dose long-acting octreotide alone.
*   The combination therapy showed a trend towards improved Overall Survival (OS), although this did not reach statistical significance.
*   The study confirmed a manageable safety profile for the combination therapy, with the most common adverse events being hematological toxicities.
*   Patients with strong somatostatin receptor expression (as indicated by DOTATOC PET positivity, as in this case) are likely to benefit most from [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   For patients with newly diagnosed, advanced grade 2-3, well-differentiated GEP-NETs and positive somatostatin receptor expression, first-line treatment with [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in combination with long-acting octreotide is recommended over high-dose long-acting octreotide alone, based on improved PFS.

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   This study’s findings are most relevant for patients with:
*   Advanced (metastatic) GEP-NETs (including pancreatic NETs).
*   Grade 2 or 3 tumors (well-differentiated).
*   Positive somatostatin receptor expression (demonstrated by PET/CT imaging, like the patient’s DOTATOC PET).
*   Newly diagnosed disease (although benefit may extend to relapsed/refractory settings).

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The evidence is strong, derived from a Phase 3, open-label, randomized controlled trial (NETTER-2). The study provides robust data supporting the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy. While the exact number of patients isn't stated in the abstract, Phase 3 trials generally involve a substantial number of participants, increasing the reliability of the findings.

14. State of the art and future directions in the systemic treatment of neuroendocrine neoplasms.
   PMID: 33973550
   Study: Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Lutathera in Patients With Grade 2 and Grade 3 Advanced GEP-NET (NCT03972488)
   Publication Date: 2021
   
   THERAPIERELEVANZ:
   This publication provides a broad overview of systemic treatment options for neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), directly addressing the clinical question of optimal therapy for advanced disease. Given the patient’s diagnosis of a Grade 2 pancreatic NET with lymph node and liver metastases, and strong somatostatin receptor expression (DOTATOC PET), this review is highly relevant for informing treatment decisions between somatuline and PRRT (Lutathera).

   KERNBEFUNDE:
   * The treatment of advanced NENs is hampered by limited robust data, highlighting the need for careful patient selection and individualized approaches.
* Somatostatin receptor expression is a crucial factor in determining treatment response, particularly for therapies targeting these receptors (like somatuline and Lutathera).
* Tumor grade, location, hormone secretion, and tumor burden are all important prognostic factors influencing treatment strategy.
* The abstract emphasizes the evolving landscape of NEN treatment, suggesting ongoing research and refinement of therapeutic approaches.

   THERAPIEEMPFEHLUNGEN:
   The publication doesn’t provide *specific* recommendations but frames the context for considering therapies like somatuline (octreotide LAR) and PRRT (Lutathera). Given the patient’s strong somatostatin receptor expression, both options are potentially viable. The NCT03972488 study (mentioned in the study context) directly investigates Lutathera in Grade 2 and 3 GEP-NETs, making it a strong candidate for consideration. The abstract suggests a personalized approach based on the factors mentioned (grade, location, burden).

   PATIENTENPOPULATION:
   The findings are most relevant for patients with *advanced* neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), specifically those with Grade 2 or 3 tumors. The patient’s strong somatostatin receptor expression makes them a particularly suitable candidate for therapies targeting this receptor. Patients with progressive disease despite initial therapies are also a key population.

   EVIDENZQUALITÄT:
   The abstract itself doesn’t provide details on specific study quality. However, the mention of NCT03972488, a Phase 3 trial, indicates a relatively high level of evidence. The abstract acknowledges the overall limited robust data in the field, suggesting that many treatment decisions are still based on expert opinion and individual patient characteristics.
