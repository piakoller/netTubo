      "brief_summary": "Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) is based on specific somatostatin receptor targeting with radiolabelled analogues 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE. These two most commonly used radiopeptides, 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE, produce overall objective response rates of 15-35%. PRRT is generally well tolerated with mild toxicity, if the necessary precautions, such as the co-administration of nephroprotective amino acids or the adjustment of the administered activity, are taken.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by surgical resection for resectable non-functioning PanNETs at high risk of recurrence.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the Rate of postoperative 90-day morbidity and mortality after neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by pancreatic resection and the secondary endpoints are:\n\n1. Rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for primary lesions' assessment, and modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), for liver metastases' assessment, if detected\n2. Quality of life (QoL) after neoadjuvant PRRT followed by pancreatic surgical resection.\n\nThe study is designed as a prospective phase II single-arm trial. 8 Italian centers will participate to the study (6 surgical sites, 2 nuclear medicine sites).\n\nPatients will be recruited for 12 months. The study will end 2 months after operation of the last patient enrolled and the total duration of the study will be 24 months.\n\nSample size estimation: 30 patients",
      "detailed_description": "Rationale:\n\nIn a recent study un initial experience was reported with neoadjuvant PRRT followed by surgical resection in patients affected by PanNETs. In this study, patients with resectable or potentially resectable PanNETs at high risk of recurrence after surgery who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT were compared with a group of patients who underwent upfront surgery. Of note, patients who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT had a significant lower risk of developing pancreatic fistula and a lower risk of postoperative complications. Moreover, among those patients who underwent curative resection, patients who received PRRT had a progression-free survival significantly longer after compared to upfront surgery. Neoadjuvant PRRT may be a valuable option to reduce the risk of failure after surgery in patients with PanNETs who are at high risk of recurrence. Nevertheless, the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT has never been investigated in a prospective trial.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by surgical resection for resectable non-functioning PanNETs at high risk of recurrence.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the Rate of postoperative 90-day morbidity and mortality after neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by pancreatic resection and the secondary endpoints are:\n\n1. Rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for primary lesions' assessment, and modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), for liver metastases' assessment, if detected.\n2. Quality of life (QoL) after neoadjuvant PRRT followed by pancreatic surgical resection.\n\nThe study is designed as a prospective phase II single-arm trial. 8 Italian centers will participate to the study (6 surgical sites, 2 nuclear medicine sites).\n\nPatients will be recruited for 12 months. The study will end 2 months after operation of the last patient enrolled and the total duration of the study will be 24 months.\n\nSample size:\n\nBy using the Single-Stage Phase II sample size method, we estimated a sample size of 30 patients to test if the proportion of patients without postoperative complications (responses) is more than or equal to 57% (p1 ) or less than equal to 39% (p0 ).\n\nTo be enrol in the study, all the patients should have a cytological/histological confirmation of PanNET and meet one or more inclusion criteria. Moreover, all the exclusion criteria should have been ruled out.\n\nPatients will undergo the following laboratory examinations at week 0, week 1, week 9, week 17, week 25, week 38, week 40, week 45-52: blood cell count, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, cloride, calcium, glucose, bilirubin, AST, ALT, LDH, GGT, ALP, Albumin, urine test. Gravindex will be executed at week 0, week 1, week 9, week 17, week 25, week 40 and they will be asked to fill a quality of life questionnaire at wwk 0, week 38, week 40-52.\n\nEnrolled patients will be treated with standard pancreatic resection according to PanNET localization, after a course (4 cycles) of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE.\n\nPatients will receive a cumulative activity of 29.600 MBq (800 mCi), divided in 4 administrations (or cycles) of 7.400 MBq (200 mCi) each, with treatment intervals of 6-8 weeks. The per-cycle activity of 177Lu-DOTATATE (and consequently the cumulative activity) might be reduced if relevant blood and renal toxicity, or other side effects, will occur during the course of PRRT.\n\n177Lu-DOTATATE will be slowly injected intravenously over a period of 30 minutes and using a dedicated pump-system of infusion.\n\nDuring the administration of the therapy, performed into a dedicated room of the Nuclear Medicine Division, the Health Physics staff will monitor the patient by means of an ionization chamber, in order to check the completeness of the radiopeptide administration.\n\nIn order to obtain an adequate hydration of the patient and to protect the renal parenchyma during the phase of excretion of the radiopharmaceutical from an excessive tubular reuptake of radiopetide, the administration of the radiopharmaceutical will be preceded and followed (without interruption) with intravenous infusion of 1000 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution containing L-Arginine hydrochloride and/or Lysine.\n\nThe gamma emission of 177Lu (113 and 208 KeV, relative abundance 6 and 11%, respectively) allows a suitable observation of the radiopharmaceutical biodistribution during the entire therapeutic phase.\n\nAfter 16-24 hours from administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE (and for each treatment cycle) patients will undergo anterior and posterior whole body scan (imaging will be acquired on a 128x512 matrix, by means a double-headed gamma-camera, equipped with a low-energy high-resolution collimator (LEHR), with energetic window set on 177Lu peaks.) in order to verify the correct bio-distribution of the radiopharmaceutical and its focal uptake into the target lesions.\n\nMoreover, at 1st and 4th cycle, when feasible and indicated, a more accurate imaging evaluation will be performed by using SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging (6-24 hours after administration), in order to quantify percentage of radiopharmaceutical uptake and half-life, absorbed dose, effective biological dose (BED), equivalent uniform dose (EUD) both in target lesions and critical organs (bone marrow and kidney) and correlate these parameters with the response to the treatment) and with the toxicity profile.\n\nAll patients will be re-evaluated 3 months after the 4th cycle of PRRT, in order to assess the rate of objective radiological response, according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1).\n\nPatients will undergo standard pancreatic surgery plus lymphadenectomy at one of the participating surgical site identified in the protocol. Pancreatic resection will be performed according to the localization and extended to nearby organs and/or vessels when invasion is present. Concomitant liver resection may be performed in the presence of liver metastasis.\n\nAssessment of outcomes. 90-day post-operative mortality and morbidity will be classified according to the definition proposed by Dindo et al.\n\nThe rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-OTATATE according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for primary lesions' assessment, and modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), for liver metastases' assessment, if detected.\n\nThe quality of life (QoL) at diagnostic workup, after neoadjuvant PRRT and after the pancreatic surgical resection, will be evaluated by EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire.\n\nData will be collected with CRFs and information will be recorded in a protected database.",

      "brief_summary": "Measurement of plasma chromogranin A remains the most commonly used biomarkers for both screening and monitoring of patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET), despite several limitations that include: lack of a reference CgA standard; wide variations depending on the used assay in different laboratories; and varying sensitivity ranges from 60 to 90% with low specificity \\<50%, depending on the population studied.\n\nSurprisingly, and to the best of our knowledge, only three studies with small numbers of participants have been published that have investigated possible effects of food intake on the measurement of CgA. Most have been performed in healthy controls or patients on treatment with proton pump inhibitors for chronic gastritis (up to n = 11 per group) but only one study has investigated patients with GEP-NET, where n = 6 patients with gastric NET were included.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aim to assess the time dependent effects of normally ingested diet (5-item English breakfast; or tea or coffee; or ongoing fasted state) on plasma chromogranin A measurements, using timed measurements over 180 min following an \\> 10 hours overnight fast, in a randomised double-crossover design. The investigators aimed to include 25 - 35 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a GEP-NET of varying primary tumour location, tumour stage, grade; and presence or absence of treatment with long acting somatostatin analogues; as well as 10 - 15 healthy controls. In an additional small subgroup of patients who are initiated on treatment with GLP-1 analogues i.e. for type 2 diabetes or obesity, the investigators aim to establish whether injection of GLP-1 analogues has any effects on plasma CgA measurements.",

We will conduct a study of all newly occurring GEP-NET and lung NET cases aged 18 years and older diagnosed between 01/01/2018 through 09/30/2024 across 14 sites participating in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), enrolling an average of 215 patients per site over the 3 year study period (2515 patients total), allowing up to 60 months of follow-up for medical record outcomes. Participants will complete four online or paper surveys over 18 months; these surveys will focus on patient-reported outcomes, including questions on quality of life, treatment decisions, and experiences with cancer care. Survey data will be linked to participant medical record data to achieve study aims.",
      "detailed_description": "NETs are a group of neoplasms that occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and the lungs, collectively referred to as gastroenteropancreatic (GEP-NETs) and lung-NETs. There are currently fewer than 180,000 patients living with this condition in the United States, meeting the criteria for rare disease status. NETs are typically slow growing, with vague signs and a myriad of symptoms (carcinoid syndrome) leading to diagnostic delays. Thus, NET patients typically experience a prolonged clinical course with active disease, and many have significant symptom burdens. However, assessment of quality of life outside of therapy trials remains scarce and of poor quality. What's more, over half of GEP-NETs are diagnosed with spread of their disease at diagnosis and are not candidates for curative surgery. Fortunately, many of these tumors are amenable to long-term medical treatment with somatostatin analogues (SSAs)- which slow down the production of hormones, especially serotonin, which helps to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. However, living with distant spread of the disease increases the probability for the disease to progress. Following failure of first-line SSA therapy there are no clear consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of other therapeutic options. NET patients are left wondering not only 'what therapy would be best to try next?', but 'if I were to take this option now, what treatment options will be closed off to me in the future?' and clinicians are unsure as to how best to tailor treatment selection on the characteristics of the patient and their tumor.\n\nThere is currently no large nationally recruiting prospective (forward in time) observational study of NET patients. Our large study will robustly generate real-world evidence on the frequency and sequence of commonly used treatments for GEP and lung NET patients in relation to Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and survival/progression, endpoints that matter most to NET patients, their caregivers, and clinicians involved in their care. Given the lack of consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of treatments, evidence generated in this study will aid patient (and clinician) navigation and selection of the next most appropriate therapy, accounting for the preferences and needs of the individual patient, whilst respecting the underlying profile of their tumor. Moreover, the infrastructure this study will generate (i.e.: electronic identification of NET patients, entry and completion of tumor table data in PCORnet, and a unique NET patient health record portal), will foster future CER studies in NETs and other rare diseases.\n\nThe four specific aims of this project are:\n\n1. To describe the frequency of treatment regimens received by line of therapy, and examine their association with symptom burden and changes in 6, 12 and 18 month health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes. The influence of patient preferences, beliefs, attitudes, and experience of care on choice of these treatment regimens will also be examined.\n2. To examine the association of patient, clinical, and tumor characteristics on the selection of first-line and beyond treatment regimens and compare the effects of common treatment sequences on frequency of subsequent treatments received and outcomes of overall survival and disease progression.\n3. To compare the effectiveness of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) regimens on outcomes of renal toxicity, disease progression, and patient-reported symptoms and HRQoL.\n4. To disseminate lessons learned and expand enrollment of the prospective cohort to patient advocate organizations, and to use the infrastructure developed to aid in the study of other rare diseases.",

      "intervention": "Positron-Emission Tomography Imaging",
      "brief_summary": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a diagnostic imaging technique that uses positron emission (e-) to image changes in diagnosed tissues. Detector systems are an important part of PET scanners. They can convert gamma photons into fluorescent photons to obtain information about energy, time and position, of the gamma photons obtained through the use of an appropriate positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical. Conventional PET scanners are expensive mostly because they require the use of LSO (lutetium oxyorthosilicate) or LYSO (lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate) scintillation crystals. Such crystal scintillators are very costly and difficult to obtain, which limits accessibility of the PET- scanners. The prototype J-PET scanner tested in this trial uses plastic scintillators in which different physical phenomena occur compared to crystal scintillators. In addition, the J-PET scanner prototype is equipped with unique software enabling three-photon imaging, based on the annihilation resulting from the formation of the orto-positronium (o-Ps) in diagnosed tissue. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the clinical acceptability of such scanners based on plastic scintillators, which can additionally collect and process information on the lifetime of o-Ps derived from routinely used radiopharmaceuticals. Additionally, the aim of this study is to demonstrate the use of the new diagnostic indicator \"positronium biomarker\" in a prospective study, compared to routine diagnostic scanning.",
      "detailed_description": "The J-PET scanner is the world's first positron tomograph based on plastic strip scintillators to measure the lifetime of the ortho-positronium (o-Ps) atom. This is a modular scanner, designed and installed at the Department of Experimental Particle Physics and Applications of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. The J-PET scanner is based on technology patented in 2014 and 2016.\n\nThe J-PET scanner, unlike PET scanners commonly used in diagnostics, has three important features:\n\n1. J-PET scintillators are made of plastic instead of expensive-to-produce LSO (lutetium oxyorthosilicate) or LYSO (lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate) scintillation crystals use in regular PET scanners;\n2. J-PET is modular and can be adapted to the patient's size and expanded to a total-body PET scanner because;\n3. J-PET can be used to test an additional parameter called the \"positronium biomarker\" which has not been used so far.\n\nAd. 1. Conventional PET scanners use LSO or LYSO scintillation crystals, which exploit the photoelectric effect and convert gamma photons into fluorescent photons to obtain information on the energy, time and position of gamma photons emitted by the positron annihilation (e+) process obtained by using an appropriate e+ emitting radiopharmaceutical. In plastic scintillators used in J-PET, the Compton effect is used, i.e. the phenomenon of scattering of high-energy photons on free or weakly bound electrons of the scintillator.\n\nAd. 2. The modular J-PET scanner can also be easily integrated with existing computed tomography (CT) systems, allowing for simultaneous conduction of both types of examinations.\n\nAd. 3. Positronium imaging is applied in the J-PET scanner. The PET technique uses radioisotopes that emit positron radiation (beta+). Traditional PET scanners image the distribution of gamma ray photons produced by the annihilation of an electron (e-) and a positron (e+). Annihilation may be preceded by the appearance of a positron atom - a quasi-stable system composed of an electron (e-) and its antiparticle - positron (e+), which occurs in approximately 30-40% of all annihilations occurring in the patient's body.\n\nThe time of such annihilation taking place through the state of the positronium atom depends on whether a positronium will be created in which e- and e+ will have parallel spins (triplet state ↑↑, this system is called ortho-positronium - o-Ps) or antiparallel spins (state singlet ↑ ↓, this system is called para-positronium - p-Ps). The average life time of o-Ps in vacuum is more then 1000 times longer (142 nano-seconds \\[ns\\]), then the average life time of p-Ps (125 pico-seconds \\[ps\\]). The average lifetime of o-Ps in a vacuum is over 1000 times longer (142 nanoseconds \\[ns\\]) than the average lifetime of p-Ps (125 picoseconds \\[ps\\]). The second difference is that o-Ps annihilation takes place over 3 photons, which has not been detected so far and which traditional PET. the annihilation time of the o-Ps atom can be an additional diagnostic parameter (\"positronium biomarker\") to be measured and analyzed in the J-PET scanner.\n\nThe clinical application of such \"positronium biomarker\" in terms of lesion detection, image quality and quantification is yet to be determined, which this study aims to address.",

With the exception of hyperthyroid patients receiving I-131 therapy, these procedures are all part of the standard of care at GSTT. Hyperthyroid patients will be required to have one whole-body scan at 24hrs post-therapy activity administration in addition to their standard care. This will not result in additional radiation exposure.\n\nThe decision to proceed with MRT will have been agreed upon at the relevant multidisciplinary meeting in accordance with current practice guidelines. Pre and post-therapy blood tests, whole body and SPECT/PET imaging will be followed as per current GSTTFT protocols. Patients will be asked to undertake the following:\n\n1. Neuroendocrine tumour and thyroid cancer patients: 1-7 days treatment whole-body gamma camera and SPECT /CT scan. (Part of standard of care post-treatment monitoring at GSTTFT).\n\n   \\*Hyperthyroid patients: 24-hour post-treatment whole-body gamma camera scan.

(Maximum reimbursement 50 £)\n\nFor the purpose of this study, two dosimetry methods will be used and compared.\n\n1. Whole-body self-monitored retention measurements study (SELFIE study):\n\n   A handheld radiation monitor (ATOMTEX model AT6130, Belarus) will be used to follow the time course of radioactivity clearance in each patient. The measurement device (SELFIE device) will be introduced to patients by a member of the medical physics team. Patients will be shown how to operate and record readings obtained and will also receive illustrated written instructions to build confidence. The devices are user friendly and patients will be asked to record the measurements twice daily using a diary sheet, typically taking about one minute to complete on each occasion. Measurement can begin immediately following administration and will continue for 28 days afterwards.\n\n   Following MRT administration, a standard whole-body dosimetry measurement will be taken by a medical physicist at 1 and 2 meters distance. The patient will begin to take SELFIE readings at the same time under supervision so that their records can be compared with the physicists' results.\n\n   After 28 days, patients will be asked to return the diary sheet and SELFIE monitor by post to GSTTFT in a pre-paid, pre-addressed envelope.\n\n   On completion of the 28-day exercise, patients will be asked to complete and return a feedback questionnaire.\n\n   The paper record of SELFIE readings will be reviewed by investigators from each patient for 28 days post-therapy.

SPECT/CT, PET/CT and whole-body scans will be performed in accordance with existing protocols at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. This will not result in additional radiation exposure. (Schedule illustrated in 16.1 Appendix).\n\nThe SUV of target and non-target tissues will be calculated from quantitative pre and post-therapy PET/CT and post-therapy SPECT/CT images. As a result, early tumour response and toxicity in patients undergoing molecular targeted radionuclide therapy can be studied.\n\nPatient-led dose rate (SELFIE) data and imaging data will be integrated to compare whole-body retention and evaluate sequential dose rate changes after repeated treatments.\n\nThe quality of SELFIE data will be assessed against pre-specified standards (completeness of data collection, data deviation).

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a network of rare tumors with common embryological origin. Functional imaging plays a major role in the extension assessment and tumor characterization of NETs. SPECT/CT with 111In-pentetreotide is the recommended test when tumors are well differentiated (grade G1 or G2). It has a real interest in diagnosis, in therapeutic decision-making (in particular by cold somatostatin analogues or in PRRT) and in the systematic follow-up of patients. Nevertheless, SPECT/CT procedure makes for a relatively long review. In addition, scintigraphy has a lower spatial resolution than PET technology and remains of limited interest for signal quantification.\n\nHowever, the ability to locate and quantitatively measure the absorption of radiopharmaceuticals in the target tissues is a major challenge in oncology for the characterization of the disease.\n\nRecent developments in radiopharmacy have made it possible to target NETs in PET imaging through the use of somatostatin analogues coupled with positron emitters, called 68Ga-DOTA peptides. The diagnostic performance of 68Ga-DOTApeptide PET/CT appears to be superior to SPECT/CT with 111In-pentetreotide. A marketing authorization has thus recently been issued in France for the use of 68Ga-DOTATOC.\n\nHistorically, the recommended quantification method in PET was based on the instantaneous measurement in static acquisition (3D) of the maximum of the standardized uptake value (SUVmax). This approach has the disadvantage to measure the signal at a time \"t\" for a single voxel of the image. Dynamic acquisition methods (4D) have been proposed to extract a radiotracer absorption coefficient (Ki) for a lesion. Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of Ki versus SUVmax in 18FDG PET/CT for the diagnostic management, therapeutic evaluation and prognosis of various solid cancers.\n\nHowever, no work has validated this approach in PET / CT at 68Ga-DOTATOC as part of the prognostic evaluation of NETs.\n\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic value of the tumor absorption coefficient Ki resulting from a 4D whole-body dynamic acquisition in PET / CT at 68Ga-DOTATOC in patients with well-differentiated NETs grade I or II according to the WHO classification",

CTC is believed to be a crucial step in cancer spreading to the bloodstream and giving rise to metastases. Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) specifically adds specificity to the analysis of the CTC.\n\nThe investigators would like to with molecular biological methods predict which patients requires special monitoring and individualized therapy and explore these tests as clinical decision support.\n\nPurpose and method\n\nIn a blood sample from patients with neuro-endocrine tumor (NET) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the investigators will by cell separation, flow cytometry and DNA sequencing and digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR):\n\n1. Identify and isolate the CTC and investigate these for tumor-specific mutations.\n2. Quantify ctDNA and analyze this for specific mutations, which in the past has been found frequent in NET and HCC.\n3. Compare findings of mutations on CTC and ctDNA with mutations in tissue biopsies.\n\nThe results are compared with the clinical data on disease course, including the effect of treatment and survival.\n\nSubjects 40 Patients with small intestinal/unknown primary NET before treatment with somatostatin analogues 30 patients with pancreatic NET before treatment with Everolimus 30 patients with presumed radically treated HCC 30 patients with HCC in treatment with Sorafenib A blood sample will be taken prior to the start of treatment, after 1 month after start of treatment and thereafter every 3.-6. month for up to two years.\n\nPerspectives In several cancer types molecular diagnostics have had significant influence in treatment and control strategy.

      "detailed_description": "This is a prospective, open label, real-world study to evaluate the feasibility of matched molecular targeted therapy in patients with refractory gastrointestinal cancer based on tumor molecular characteristics as standard treatment failure. This is a non-randomized trial designed to test molecular matching strategies based on patient genome information. The molecular tumor board (MTB) will recommend treatment, but the treatment decision is up to the attending physician. FoundationOne CDx was used for tissue genomic analysis. If possible, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor mutation load (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) status will also be evaluated. Based on this information, MTB, composed of multidisciplinary experts, will focus on the selection of customized, best matched drugs or combinations to target most of the genomic changes in each patient, also taking into account potential drug toxicity. The final treatment will be based on the choice of oncologists, who will formulate treatment plan by combining MTB discussion, patient preference, attention to complications, consideration of drug toxicity, insurance coverage of off label drugs and availability of clinical trials of research drugs, thus reflecting the actual clinical practice nowadays in China. The acquisition of drugs follows the actual situation in the real world and is not within the scope of this study design.\n\nThe principles of MTB treatment recommendations can be referred to the NCI-MATCH trial:\n\nGrade 1: FDA / NMPA approval; clear evidence and mechanism; concomitant diagnostic relationship between drug and target.\n\nGrade 2: The drug reaches the clinical end point (objective response rate, PFS or OS); there is evidence of target inhibition; there is strong evidence to predict relationship between the target and the drug.\n\nGrade 3: The drug has evidence of clinical activity and target inhibition; there is some evidence to predict the relationship between target and drug.\n\nGrade 4: Pre-clinical evidence of anti-tumor activity and evidence of target inhibition; there is hypothesis to predict the relationship between target and drug.\n\nPatients who meet the inclusion criteria and sign informed consent will be analyzed for tumor mutation by FoundationOne CDx detection. Biopsy specimens of metastatic foci can be selected for gene detection. If there is no targeted therapy among patients, the archived diagnostic tumor samples can also be used for detection. If the patient has received targeted therapy, the investigators will try to obtain biopsy samples after treatment. If the sample cannot be tested or the test results are not satisfactory, additional slices need to be sent to the laboratory. If the repeated test fails, repeat biopsy if the clinical conditions permit, or patients should be included in the unmatched treatment group.\n\nDetermining the interventability of gene mutations depends on genomic changes, allele frequency, and diagnosis. This study will combine the recommendations of MTB and gene testing reports to determine the interventability of mutated genes.\n\nInterventional mutation: cancers have FDA or NMPA approved therapies, or there are matching drugs in clinical trials.\n\nNon-interventional mutation: there is no FDA or NMPA approved treatment for cancers, and no matching drug is available in clinical trials.\n\nMTB should at least be composed of attending doctors, molecular pathology experts and bioinformatics experts. The research center is responsible for the establishment and holding of MTB. As management of patients enrolled in this study is essential, the research committee, including but not limited to the main investigator of the study and the treated medical oncologist, can provide advice as needed between MTB meetings to avoid treatment delays. By analyzing the genomic variation of patients, independent MTB recommends molecular targeted therapy that can inhibit the mutation directly or through related pathways or be included in relevant clinical trials. The independent research committee will use the \"N-to-1\" model of precision medicine to propose a matching therapy consisting of at least one drug that targets molecular changes. The investigators expect 50-70% of patients to carry intervening variants, and that proportion is rising rapidly as learning more about these pathways and drugs. The investigators expect that about 40% of patients with intervening variants will be able to receive molecular targeted \"matching\" therapy.",

      "brief_summary": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of concomitant main pancreatic duct exposure, repair, or reconstruction during minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation on long-term patient prognosis and quality of life.",
      "detailed_description": "Standard surgical procedures for benign or low-grade malignant pancreatic tumors is associated with increased risks of postoperative complications and long-term pancreatic functional impairment, while parenchyma-sparing pancreatectomy such as enucleation can reduce the incidence of complications and preserve healthy parenchyma, thereby preserve both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function. It has been reported that pancreatic tumor enucleation is a safe and feasible approach in preserving normal physiological function in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery.\n\nWith the growing emphasis on routine screenings and the application of high-quality thin-slice imaging techniques, the detection rates of pancreatic tumors have witnessed a steady increase. Additionally, there is a notable trend towards younger patients being diagnosed with pancreatic tumors. Consequently, in conjunction with ensuring safe and thorough tumor resection while maximizing preservation of pancreatic function, there is a current clinical demand to further reduce surgical trauma.\n\nLiterature reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that minimally invasive enucleation procedures offer well-known advantages associated with minimally invasive approaches, such as shorter postoperative hospital stays and lower overall complication rates. While the occurrence rate of severe complications, such as postoperative hemorrhage, remains relatively low, the development of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) continues to pose a challenging issue.\n\nThe distance between the tumor and the main pancreatic duct (MPD) is considered a crucial factor influencing the occurrence of POPF after enucleation. However, these data have been rarely described in previous studies, making it challenging to accurately assess their actual impact on the rate of POPF occurrence. Heeger et al. suggested that the risk of POPF increases with closer proximity of the tumor to the MPD. The incidence of POPF was higher in deep-seated tumors after pancreatic enucleation (distance to MPD \\<3 mm) compared to superficial tumors (\\>3 mm) (73.3% vs. 30.0%, P=0.002). Other studies have even limited this critical distance to 2mm. Some research has indicated that if the tumor invades or encases the MPD, enucleation surgery should be contraindicated, and standard resection should be preferred to avoid the risk of POPF postoperatively. However, a retrospective analysis by Strobel et al. on 166 cases of pancreatic tumor enucleation demonstrated that even tumors in close proximity to the MPD can be safely resected, although their study did not include cases with tumor encasement of the MPD.\n\nDuring the expansive growth of solid tumors such as neuroendocrine tumors and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, they can compress the MPD, causing inflammatory adhesions. Cystic tumors can also surround the MPD as they grow. Enucleation of these tumors may inevitably lead to exposure, injury, or transection of the MPD, necessitating repair and reconstruction. Recent years have seen successful cases reported of end-to-end anastomosis of the MPD. Minimally invasive techniques have also facilitated the promotion of MPD repair or bridging reconstruction surgeries. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive research data in this field.\n\nThe safety and feasibility of minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation procedures involving MPD exposure, repair, or reconstruction, the control of POPF, and the long-term prognosis and quality of life of patients after MPD repair or reconstruction remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a prospective cohort study. The results of this study will serve as a valuable reference for clinical practice and promote the development and application of minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation procedures.",

It was assumed that no well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with a mitotic- or a Ki-67- index above 20% existed.\n\nRecently, a proportion of neuroendocrine tumors corresponding to grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors with a proliferation- or Ki-67 index \\> 20% and with a well-differentiated morphology have been identified. This entity has been partially explored and may have a different survival than grade 3 NEC. Furthermore, targeted therapies, and used in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have not been assessed in this case.\n\nThe TENpath network is a pathological network whose goal is the systematic reading of all diagnosed cases of neuroendocrine tumors. As part of this network, nearly 3.000 neuroendocrine tumors were reviewed by pathologist experts. Of all the reviewed tumors, 167 were identified as well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors, observed Ki-67(5.6%) confirming the existence of this entity.\n\nTreatment and follow-up of well-differentiated grade 3 tumors are not consensus-based and recommendations are exclusively based on experts' opinions. The purpose of this study is to define the characterization of this entity and evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy on well-differentiated grade 3 digestive neuroendocrine tumors identified from the TENpath network.",

      "brief_summary": "Background: Liver metastases are common in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms, but often underestimated by preoperative imaging. Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) is the reference standard for staging of primary and metastatic liver tumors, with a diagnostic accuracy superior to that of CT and MRI. Rationale: The present study aims to evaluate the contribution of IOUS to staging of liver disease in patients with neuroendocrine tumor candidates for primary tumor resection classified as cM0 at preoperative imaging.\n\nThe study will collect a prospective series of 99 patients undegoing surgery for gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at the Humanitas Clinical Institute (coordinating centre) or at one of the participating centres in the period 2020-2023. All patients had to be cM0 tumor at preoperative imaging. Additional inclusion criteria: age\\>18 years, ability to give the informed consent for study participation; no other malignancies in the previous 5 years; preoperative staging including abdominal CT and DOTATOC PET-CT performed ≤60 days before surgery.\n\nThis prospective observational multicentre study aims to elucidate the proportion of patients with gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cM0 at preoperative imaging that have intraoperative detection of liver metastases at IOUS.\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n- Performances of IOUS in identifying liver metastases in patients with neuroendocrine tumor classified as cM0 at preoperative imaging\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n* Impact of IOUS on the therapeutic strategy\n* Performances of preoperative imaging (CT, MRI and PET-CT) in comparison with those of IOUS\n\nThe study will collect a prospective series of 99 patients undergoing surgery for gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at the Humanitas Clinical Institute (coordinating centre) or at one of the participating centres in the period 2020-2023.\n\nThe study includes the following steps:\n\nPreoperative / enrollment: All patients candidates to resection of gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor will be considered for the study. Only cM0 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study must have performed a preoperative abdominal CT scan with contrast medium and a DOTATOC-PET-CT (both performed ≤60 days before surgery).\n\nIntraoperative: During surgery, the investigator will perform, as standard in our clinical practice, an accurate exploration of the liver by inspection, palpation and IOUS. The investigator will record the identification of any liver lesion. If one or more nodules suspect of being neuroendocrine liver metastases are identified, it will be necessary, whenever possible, as already routinely performed, to carry out a biopsy or to remove it (if superficial) for histological confirmation of the diagnosis. After completion of liver staging, the primary tumor will be resected.\n\nPostoperative / follow-up: Enrolled patients will have standard postoperative management.\n\nStandard statistical analyses will be performed. Per-patient and per-lesion analyses will be performed to asses performances of preoperative imaging modalities (CT, MRI, PET-CT) and of intraoperative ones (inspection, palpation, and IOUS).",

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are generally slow growing, but some can be aggressive and resistant to treatment. Compared to healthy cells, the surface of these tumor cells has a greater number of special molecules called somatostatin receptors (SSTR). Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and conventional imaging are used to detect NETs.\n\nThis study proposes 18F-AmBF3-TATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is superior to current imaging techniques. The goal is to evaluate the biodistribution and safety of 18F-AmBF3-TATE PET/CT for neuroendocrine tumour imaging.",

The 18F-AmBF3-TATE radioactive tracer is manufactured for this study under a Clinical Trial Application filed with Health Canada.\n\nAfter providing informed written consent subjects will complete a medical history questionnaire.\n\nMonitoring of adverse events There will be short-term evaluation of adverse events by comparison of vital signs before and after administration of 18F-AmBF3-TATE . Eighteen to seventy-two hours after 18F-AmBF3-TATE administration the participant will return to the imaging department to perform a follow up safety assessment and routine blood draw. The study coordinator will ask the participant if they have experienced any adverse events during that time period and complete the adverse event questionnaire.\n\nFollow-up Assessments\n\nThe following information will be collected up to 12 months following the PET/CT scans:\n\nInitiation of a new treatment, Laboratory results and pathology reports, Results of imaging studies, Final clinical diagnosis by physician and relevant clinical notes. The study is expected to take up to 1 year for accrual.",

Detection of NEN and monitoring of response to therapy is still challenging due to their cellular heterogeneity. Initial preclinical studies suggest that NEN imaging with the use of SSTR2-Antagonist may be advantageous in comparison to the widely used SSTR2-Agonists.\n\nRecently, novel radiopharmaceuticals, based on SSTR2-Antagonists, were shown to provide superior SSTR2 visualisation than currently used agonists. The need for molecular imaging of NEN is expected to grow significantly in the near future due to their increasing incidence and prevalence. Although a persistent trend to shift the molecular imaging of NEN from conventional SPECT/CT gamma cameras to PET/CT has been observed in the last decade, labelling the compound with Tc-99m offers significant advantages by its extremely wide availability, low cost and low radiation exposure to patients. Effective and accessible molecular imaging methods as an integral part of personalised patient management are needed to optimise selection and follow-up of available therapeutic modalities. The Tc-99m-labeled SSTR2-Antagonist \\[99mTc\\]Tc-TECANT1 is expected to be an effective, widely available compound for quantitative assessment of SSTR2 NEN status, allowing a personalised therapeutic approach.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from various endocrine glands, endocrine cells within non-endocrine tissue and diffuse endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and genitourinary tract. Detection of NEN and monitoring of their response to therapy is challenging due to their varied location (often-unknown primary focus) and cellular heterogeneity. NEN exhibit a wide range of histological appearances and biological behaviors, and may all potentially behave in an aggressive manner, irrespective of the initial diagnosis. Consequently, the prediction of clinical outcomes in an individual patient is often difficult and inaccurate. According to some national registries, the incidence of NEN increased more than 6-fold and the prevalence more than 8-fold between 1973 and 2012, making NEN the second most prevalent diagnosis in gastrointestinal malignancies, thus representing a growing challenge. The rise in the incidence can be partly attributed to increased awareness of the disease and better detection methods. Diagnostic imaging is an integral part of the management of patients with NEN by localising the primary or recurrence site, determining the extent of the disease and evaluating response to therapy. Nuclear medicine with single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) is a branch of molecular imaging: in contrast to anatomical imaging, it depicts functional changes and biological characteristics of target tissues, providing a unique insight into the biology of malignant disease, and has established itself as an excellent tool in personalized medicine. The characteristic feature of NEN is an overexpression of somatostatin receptors (SSTR) on cell membranes. Molecular imaging techniques utilise the ability of SST analogues labelled with radioactive (single-photon or positron emitting) nuclides to bind to the SSTR. A combination of molecular and anatomical imaging (hybrid imaging, SPECT/CT and PET/CT) is currently the most sensitive approach to visualisation of SSTR-positive tumours. In NEN patients the prognosis depends on the grade and stage of the tumour. However, SSTR expression determines not only efficacy of staging using molecular imaging methods, but also efficacy of antiproliferative therapy with SST analogues both not radiolabelled (\"cold\") and labelled with a therapeutic radionuclide thus enabling Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) as the main approach to personalised NEN patients' management. Traditionally, radiolabelled SST analogues were constructed aiming at their agonistic behaviour, based on their internalisation after SSTR activation and consequent retention within the tumour cells, believed to be crucial for efficient molecular imaging and therapy. Recently, it has been shown that novel molecular probes, SSTR antagonists, recognise more binding sites and hence improve diagnostic efficacy, especially when the density of SSTR is low. Accumulating preclinical and clinical data using both SPECT and PET tracers shows that high-affinity SSTR antagonists can provide better SSTR visualisation than agonists. Preclinical data and subsequent clinical evaluation demonstrated higher tumour uptake of an In-111-labelled antagonist \\[111In\\]In-DOTA-sst2-ANT (\\[111In\\]In-DOTA-BASS) compared to the agonist \\[111In\\]In-DTPA0-octreotide or \\[111In\\]In -DTPA0-octreotate, as well as superior tumour-to-background ratios. One of the first reports describing the SSTR2 antagonist LM3 indicates the high potential of gallium-68 (Ga-68) and copper-64 (Cu-64) radiolabelled LM3 in PET/CT. The authors demonstrated strong dependence of the affinity and pharmacokinetics of the SST-based radiolabelled antagonists on the chelator and radiometal, also confirmed using another SSTR antagonist, namely JR11. The Superiority of the SSTR antagonist was demonstrated in the Phase I/II clinical study using a positron emitter, \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NODAGA-JR11 and in a pilot study conducted with beta-emitting, therapeutic radionuclide (lutetium-177, Lu-177) labelled SSTR antagonist \\[177Lu\\]Lu-DOTA-JR11. As a result, research in the field is currently strongly focused on SSTR antagonists. Ga-68-labelled SST analogues have already established PET as a unique tool for personalising treatment of NEN. Nevertheless, single-photon emitting radiopharmaceuticals still represent the cornerstone of molecular imaging, particularly those based on Technetium-99m (Tc-99m). Its physical properties (half-life of 6 hours, optimal energy of 140 keV for imaging and lowest radiation exposure), widest on-site availability and cost-effectiveness are of major importance for routine clinical applications. Medical diagnostic imaging techniques using Tc-99m account for approximately 80% of all nuclear medicine procedures, representing 30-40 million examinations worldwide every year; even in developed countries, the number of gamma cameras in use exceeds by far the number of PET systems. Considering the above-mentioned characteristics Tc-99m is perfect for research with new radiotracers and is still recognised as the workhorse of diagnostic nuclear medicine. Quantifiable uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in target tissue using standardised methods and metrics such as standardised uptake value (SUV) is currently a unique feature of PET allowing highly personalized approaches to patient management and is part of clinical routine. It was shown also in NEN that the quantitative approach is able to adequately predict and evaluate the response to various treatments available, including \"cold\" and radiolabelled somatostatin analogues (PRRT). However, single-photon quantitative imaging has developed significantly and is also entering clinical routine. Identical quantitative metrics are becoming available with the use of SPECT/CT systems (SPECT SUV) with comparable accuracy and clinical applicability. The development of a quantitative SPECT imaging approach in NEN, in combination with improved, widely available radiopharmaceuticals, would therefore represent a highly significant improvement in management, tailored to the needs of each individual patient.",

Circulating biomarkers that are associated with GEP-NETs are limited to measurements of plasma chromogranin A (CgA). The investigators have developed a PCR-based tool to quantitate (score) the circulating GEP-NET molecular signature (\"liquid\" biopsy) with high sensitivity and specificity. This signature can identify all types of GEP-NETs including small (1cm) non-metastatic tumors, is significantly reduced after tumor debulking and is decreased following surgical \"cure\". Elevated post-surgical scores are associated with tumor recurrence within 6 months in \\~40% of cases. Current NET treatment protocols are associated with tumor recurrence (progression free survival) ranging from 5-18 months. The majority of patients will experience a relapse within 18 months irrespective of the treatment approach. The investigators hypothesize that a PCR measurement of circulating NET mRNA can accurately predict the extent of surgical resection (tumor removal) and elevated scores can predict tumor relapse before this occurs. This biomarker protocol seeks to test this hypothesis and evaluate whether changes in plasma CgA are as effective in predicting resection and recurrence.",

Current grading of neuroendocrine tumors are based on the 2010 WHO classification. This classifies grade 3 tumors as the neuroendocrine tumor with mitosis \\> 20 per 10 high power field or Ki-67 labeling index \\> 20%. Etoposide-based chemotherapy, mostly as the combination with cisplatin, has been the mainstay of the treatment for patients with grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors. However, a recent large retrospective analysis has suggested this regimen may not be effective in relatively low Ki-67 labeling index. Therefore, the investigators designed a clinical trial testing temozolomide-capecitabine combination, which has been mostly investigated in well differentiated (ie., grade 1 or 2) neuroendocrine tumors, in patients with grade 3 and low Ki-67 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.",

      "detailed_description": "Current guidelines recommend FNA and FNB needles equally for pancreatic and other deep-seated lesions. However, some studies indicate that the sample adequacy for histologic evaluation is higher when using FNB compared with FNA needles. The diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor (NET), autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), and other gastrointestinal stromal tumors require high-quality tissue sampling for IHC diagnosis. Whether FNB is superior to FNA in these IHC-required lesions remains unclear.\n\nThe investigators performed this at 2 tertiary care centers in China. The study prospectively collected patients undergoing EUS for a solid mass (\\>1 cm) in the pancreas, abdomen, mediastinum, or pelvic cavity from December 2014 diagnosed with AIP, NET, mesenchymal tumors, and Lymphoma. Patients accepted FNB or FNA according to doctors' and patients' willingness in a real-world setting. All procedures were performed by experienced endosonographers; cytologists and pathologists were blinded to the sample collection method. Patients were followed for at least 48 weeks, and final diagnoses were obtained after surgery, imaging analysis, or resolution of the lesion. The primary aim was to compare diagnostic yields of EUS-FNA with EUS-FNB for all solid masses, then separately as AIP, NET, mesenchymal tumors, and lymphoma. The secondary endpoint was the quality of the histologic specimen.",

      "detailed_description": "The ANTARES study is a phase II \"basket\" trial designed to evaluate the tissue-agnostic efficacy of the monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with advanced or metastatic rare tumors. A \"basket\" trial is an innovative type of clinical trial where patients with different types of cancers, but sharing a common molecular feature (in this case, PD-L1 expression), are treated with the same therapy, regardless of the tumor's site of origin. This approach allows for the evaluation of treatments targeting specific molecular characteristics, independent of the primary cancer type.\n\nRare tumors, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), have an incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people per year. Although each rare cancer type is individually uncommon, collectively they account for 25-30% of all malignancies and are often underrepresented in clinical trials due to recruitment challenges and limited funding. As a result, patients with rare cancers generally have a poorer prognosis compared to those with more common tumors.\n\nIn this study, patients with advanced or refractory rare malignancies expressing PD-L1, with a combined positive score (CPS) of ≥10, will be treated with nivolumab. Treatment will be administered until disease progression or for a maximum duration of 12 months, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of this tissue-agnostic immunotherapy approach. Efficacy will be measured according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, with objective response as the primary endpoint. Additionally, the study will assess response biomarkers, including PD-L1, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and microvesicles, to better understand the correlation between biomarker expression and clinical outcomes.\n\nThis multicenter trial, with an estimated duration of four years, will be conducted at Institute of Cancer of the State of São Paulo (ICESP) and other partner institutions. The study aims to overcome existing barriers in rare cancer treatment by offering an innovative approach that explores the potential of personalized therapies based on molecular characteristics, rather than the tumor's primary site",

This study will also asses the safety of Lu-DOTA-TATE, and the quality of life of the patients treated with Lu-DOTA-TATE.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine (NET) tumours have secretory and metabolic pathways not typically found in other cancers that can be utilized for molecular imaging and therapeutic targeting. The most important is somatostatin. Somatostatin receptors are useful tools in the diagnosis and treatment of NET tumours because the somatostatin analogue octreotate can be radiolabeled with lutetium-177 for imaging and therapy.\n\nIn selected populations of patients, radioisotope therapy in expert hands has been shown to be a safe and effective palliative therapy with stable disease, progression free survival benefit, symptom control and improvements in quality of life. Lutetium-177 (DOTA0, Tyr3) octreotate has been used in a significant number of clinical studies shown to be safe and effective as a therapeutic agent in patients with NET tumours. The investigators intend to further confirm these benefits with lutetium-177 octreotate, which could form the basis for a national registry study leading to registration of this therapeutic intervention.",

Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and (iii) rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours).\n\nThe role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.\n\nThis protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of nivolumab \\& ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 2 clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with rare cancers. This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab. If the safety profile is acceptable and clinically efficacy is seen, this study would support the use of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with these cancers.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, they are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. The rare care project has defined a rare malignancy as a cancer with an incidence of less than 6/100000/year. It is estimated that 42,000 people are diagnosed with a form of rare or less common cancer in Australia every year (www.canceraustralia.gov.au). The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of these patients. Given the recent success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a whole range of different cancer types, it can be postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. It is proposed here that patient cohorts which fall within three distinct tumour streams will be examined, with all patients receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy. The three tumour streams are defined as: upper GI malignancies (comprising intra-hepatic/ extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal cancers).); neuroendocrine tumours (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours). Although overall response rates for individual tumour types will not be established due to sample size (target 20 patients per tumour stream, n=60 total), descriptive information of individual patient responses will guide immune-directed therapies to responsive rare tumour types and may be broadened to tumour streams.",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well temozolomide and capecitabine work compared to standard treatment with cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, capecitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Certain types of neuroendocrine carcinomas may respond better to treatments other than the current standard treatment of cisplatin and etoposide. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and capecitabine may work better than cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with this type of neuroendocrine carcinoma, called non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.",

To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the PFS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the response rate (RR) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the RR of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nII. To assess the overall survival (OS) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the OS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nIII. To evaluate the toxicities associated with the combination of temozolomide and capecitabine and the combination of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide, respectively, in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the impact of each treatment regimen on PFS, RR and OS based on marker of proliferation Ki-67 index in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. (Laboratory) II. To assess the prognostic significance of well differentiated versus poorly differentiated non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in relationship to survival and response to treatment. (Laboratory) III. To assess the agreement in Ki-67 status between that reported by institutional pathologist and that reported by central pathology review. (Laboratory)\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 10-14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) on days 1-3 or carboplatin IV on day 1. Patients also receive etoposide IV on days 1-3.

These patients have important supportive care needs that represent a major challenge for improving treatment tolerance and patient survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\n\nMalnutrition and sarcopenia (muscle wasting and dysfunction) are associated with an increased risk of death, complications from chemotherapy, infections, emergency procedures and hospitalizations, and increased costs of care. Therefore, malnutrition and sarcopenia represent a major clinical target in GI cancers.\n\nInterventions targeting malnutrition/sarcopenia should be implemented as early as possible in patients' pathways, these syndromes being reversible at early stages but not at late stages.\n\nA multidisciplinary assessment at diagnosis and therapeutic approach combining nutritional support and and adapted physical activity (APA) in addition to anticancer treatments should be systematically implemented in patients with advanced GI cancers.\n\nThis type of intervention complies with the standards recommended by the National Cancer Institute (INCa) to promote the practice of physical activity during and after treatment in oncology.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without nivolumab works in treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer or cancer that has come back. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy and nivolumab may work better at treating non-small cell lung cancer.",

      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare neoplasms, but with increasing incidence and prevalence in the last decades. Although they may manifest in the most diverse tissues, the vast majority of cases will affect organs of the digestive tract and lung. At diagnosis, more than half of the cases present metastatic disease, and among patients with localized disease, up to one-third will have recurrence of the disease. Unfortunately, the minority of patients with metastatic disease are eligible for curative intent. Although there are many types of NET, they are often studied together as a group because their cells share common histological findings, have special secretory granules, and the ability to secrete bioactive amines and polypeptide hormones. Approximately 25 percent of the tumors present functional hormonal syndromes (situation of great morbidity for these patients), being the carcinoid syndrome, the most common one. From the molecular point of view, these neoplasias are largely dependent on the activation of the mTOR pathway and neoangiogenesis. Another striking feature of neuroendocrine cells is the expression of cell surface hormone receptors whose activation or blockade may exert an important regulatory function. The discovery of somatostatin, and consequently its receptors, is one of the major advances in the treatment of this neoplasm. Due to the increased ability of somatostatin to inhibit the secretion of several hormones, its antitumor property has long been studied. However, only after the development of synthetic long-life formulations can their use be used in clinical practice. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (G1 and G2 according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification) present in more than 80 percent of somatostatin receptor cases. In this population, the use of somatostatin analogues promotes symptomatic improvement of functioning syndromes in the order of 70 to 77 percent and biochemical improvement around 50 percent . Regarding antiproliferative activity, two phase III studies evaluated the role of octreotide LAR and of lanreotide autogel, both somatostatin analogs, in the population of well differentiated tumors and, almost entirely, somatostatin receptor hyperexpressors when evaluated by octreoscan. In these studies, the use of somatostatin analogue was associated with reduced risk of progression or death from 53 percent to 66 percent when compared to placebo. Currently, this class of drugs is often considered as the first treatment option for patients with progressing metastatic disease, when the strategy of watchful waiting is not opted for (because they are tumors of sometimes indolent behavior, some cases are selected for observation only). In general, there are few options for systemic therapies that are approved for these tumors in addition to somatostatin analogs (mTOR and antiangiogenic inhibitors), none of which clearly demonstrate overall survival gain, are costly and none are available for use in the public health system (SUS). Therefore, it is very important to develop studies with new therapies for patients with NET, especially, molecularly defined therapies with greater access to patients. In this context, other anti-hormonal therapies could be explored in patients with NET, such as the role of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, as well as their receptors. A few studies have evaluated the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in NET and suggest interesting results. One of the largest series was conducted at the AC Camargo Cancer Center where the immunohistochemical expression of these receptors was evaluated in 96 patients with NET from various sites. About 35 percent of the cases presented positivity for some hormonal receptor (HR) in the tumor tissue. Among the HR positive cases, there was no difference between sex, more frequent in thin, pancreatic and lung tumors and in well differentiated tumors (G1 and G2 by the WHO). Viale et al. Evaluated the expression of progesterone receptors (PR) in 96 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Nuclear immunoreactivity for PR was observed in 58 percent of cases, with no difference in PR expression according to gender, age, or functioning syndromes. About 163 primary tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic site and 115 metastases were evaluated by Zimmermann and colleagues for expression of female hormone receptors. Progesterone receptor was more frequently found in pancreatic tumors and rarely in non-pancreatic (p \\<0.001), estrogen receptor was more frequently expressed in non-pancreatic tumors (\\<0.001) and in women (p: 0.019). There was no difference between primary site and presence of metastases. Apparently, HR positive tumors may present a more favorable evolution. A study evaluated 160 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors operated for expression by PTEN immunohistochemistry (negative regulator of the mTOR pathway) and PR. Approximately 69 percent of the cases were positive for PR and PTEN, 28 percent were positive for one of the two markers and only 3 percent were negative for both. Combined positivity for PTEN and PR was associated with metastasis-free survival in stages I and II (p \\<0.001) and overall survival in all patients (p \\<0.001), even after adjustment for other prognostic variables. Patients with negative PR and PTEN tumors had the shorter survival times when compared to those who had only one or both markers (p \\<0.001). 9 Similarly, other author demonstrated a retrospective analysis of 277 patients with neuroendocrine tumors (95 percent vs. 76 percent, p \\<0.05), and a higher survival rate (p \\<0.05) than in the control group (p \\<0.05) 0.015). Even rarer in the literature is the role of antiestrogen therapies as a form of control of this neoplasia. Case reports point to antiproliferative activity of tamoxifen in patients with NET and, in some cases, patients presenting more than 12 months of disease control.11 Reports of control of carcinoid syndrome and even regression of associated retroperitoneal fibrosis have also been described. However, the only study to assess the activity of tamoxifen in neuroendocrine tumors dates back to 1984. Sixteen patients were evaluated clinical benefit in only 19 percent of cases and no radiological response. However, in this study, no patient was previously selected for HR tumor expression or degree of differentiation, which the investigators believe limited benefit in disease control. Therefore, based on the premise that there is a need for research and treatment strategies for this rare neoplasm; there is clear therapeutic embezzlement in the public heath system due to the high cost of the treatments approved in the country for this neoplasia; NET are tumors that may present positivity to estrogen and / or progesterone receptors; evidence points to the possibility of antiproliferative effect using hormonal therapy, the investigators propose a phase II study of tamoxifen for patients with well differentiated NET and positive for HR, estrogen and / or progesterone expression.",

The objective of this study is to evaluate if the maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) on PET/CT in NETs inversely correlates with Ki-67 score on initial biopsy. If this hypothesized correlation between SUV and Ki-67 score is reproduced, then DOTATATE would serve as a non-invasive method to assess cellular proliferation and therefore prognosis of these patients.",

The CXCR4 receptor is a marker of poorly differentiated cells. Pentixafor is a peptide that targets these CXCR4 receptors. By combining it with gallium-68, a radionuclide, pentixafor can then be evaluated as an imaging agent to detect high-grade neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n\\[68Ga\\]Pentixafor is a radio-labelled imaging agent used for positron emission tomography (PET). The dose is small, known as a tracer dose. It is designed to capture information about the body and how the body is working without interfering or causing an effect.\n\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate how the \\[68Ga\\]Pentixafor is distributed through the body after injection and how it is taken up by the organs of the body. The study will also examine if the imaging is reproducible to determine if the PET images show the same uptake of the study drug across different scans.\n\nThis study is an RDRC study - the equivalent to a phase 0 study.

      "detailed_description": "When patients are suspected of having neuroendocrine tumours, they will usually undergo various imaging scans such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and octreotide scintigraphy (octreoscan) to try to identify the primary tumour. During the patients' course of disease, they will continue to have various CT, MRI, and/or octreoscans. Sometimes, despite using scans, laboratory tests, and examination, it is still difficult to properly diagnose neuroendocrine tumours.\n\nDoctors have found that most neuroendocrine tumours make too much of a hormone called somatostatin on their cell surface. Because of this doctors have been using positron emission tomography (PET) scans using a special contrast dye called 68Ga-DOTATATE in hopes of better diagnosing and managing neuroendocrine tumours. 68Ga-DOTATATE can label the cells that have somatostatin (such as neuroendocrine tumour cells) so that the PET scan can take better pictures and doctors can better diagnose and manage the disease.\n\nHowever, despite 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans showing promise, it is still not widely accessible. Because of this, researchers are creating a registry for patients who may need 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans to:\n\n* Identify their primary tumour where the doctor suspects is a neuroendocrine tumour\n* Staging of the neuroendocrine tumour\n* Restage the tumour prior to surgery/radiotherapy or help to assess the tumour where standard scans such as CTs, MRIs, or octreoscans are not properly showing your tumours despite other clinical or laboratory tests showing that your disease has progressed\n* For other issues when confirmation of site of disease and/or disease extent may impact clinical management of the neuroendocrine tumour.\n\nThis registry help the participant's treating physician to obtain approval for the participant to undergo 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans for their neuroendocrine tumour.",

Staging: For the staging of patients with localized primary NETs and/or limited metastasis where definitive surgery is planned.\n  * Group C. Restaging: Restaging of patients with NET where surgery or peptide-receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) is being considered; OR, where conventional imaging is negative or equivocal at time of clinical and/or biochemical progression.\n  * Group D.

PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as niraparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cetrelimab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

To begin researching this drug, we need to determine if \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET is safe and tolerable when used as a cancer treatment. As a safety study, it is unknown if the treatment is safe or effective.\n\nThe study will also estimate the radiation dose to the kidneys for this treatment. To calculate this radiation dose, imaging is also performed with the sister drug, \\[203Pb\\] VMT-α-NET using SPECT/CT imaging. Each participant is assigned a radiation dose to the kidneys that cannot be exceeded. The study is testing the safety of the specific radiation dose to the kidneys when using \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET.\n\nParticipants are assigned a radiation dose based on how other participants have tolerated the \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET. The amount of \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET administered varies person-to-person because of each person's unique tumor uptake of \\[203Pb\\] VMT-α-NET and how long it lasts in the body.\n\nThe study involves 2 treatments, about 8 to 10 weeks apart. The drug is given by infusion once per treatment. The participants also receive an infusion of amino acids to help protect the kidneys as well as medications to help protect against nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).\n\nOnce a participant is administered the \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET, they must be followed (i.e. come back to the clinic) for at least 6 months for safety assessments. Safety assessments include blood tests to check bone marrow, kidney, and liver function as well as urinary tests to check kidney function. Participants will also have imaging at 6 months post-treatment to measure how their tumors responded to therapy.\n\nParticipants will have lifelong follow-up for this study.",

      "detailed_description": "With increasing use of high-resolution conventional imaging, pancreatic incidentalomas are being diagnosed more frequently. In two recent surgical series, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinomas account for 10-15 % of all pancreatic incidentalomas, the majority ( 75-90 % of cases) well differentiated. The factors affecting the behaviour of pancreatic NETs are differentiation, histological grade, staging, size and intratumoral microvascular density. In updated World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the grading system is based on tumor differentiation, the rate of proliferation and Ki-67 index. The management of pancreatic NETs depends on tumor stage and on presence or not of hormonal syndrome. By definition, the incidentally discovered pancreatic NETs (PNETs) are unassociated with hormonal syndromes (nonfunctioning) and detected in patients who undergo diagnostic evaluations for unrelated conditions.\n\nThe therapeutic approach for hormonally functional tumor, or large tumor (\\> 2 cm) with local, vascular or lymph nodes invasion, highly suggestive of malignancy, or in presence of metastasis, is well admitted: surgery is indicated or should be discussed.\n\nHowever, the attitude is less consensual for small (≤ 2 cm) non-functioning (NF) and non-metastatic lesions. There is a paucity of literature reporting pancreatic neuroendocrine incidentalomas and their characteristics. However, given their increased incidence, they are an emerging problem and require changes in treatment guidelines. In English, American or French recommendations, systematic surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is currently recommended in all medically fit patients. The follow-up (FU) is possible for tumors \\<2 cm (T1) located in the pancreatic head and for which enucleation is not feasible. This therapeutic approach has two limitations: 1) the significant incidence of these tumors, because of the widespread use of routine imaging, and the improved technology of multi detector CT scan, the fortuitous discovery of small pancreatic incidentalomas is becoming more common. 2) Pancreatic surgery carries significant postoperative morbidity even in high-volume tertiary centers and even in parenchyma-preserving resection. This may results in many pancreatic resections for tumors with unknown natural history. On the other hand, the follow-up may be a factor of considerable anxiety, and carries the risk, actually difficult to assess, to let the tumor grow between two monitoring controls, with the possible evolution to the irreversible metastatic stage of the disease.\n\nAs a result, the investigators are unceasingly facing a dilemma: how to manage asymptomatic patients with small incidentally detected, potentially benign NETs? Several recently published retrospective studies discuss the \"non- surgical\" management of the small NF incidentally detected pancreatic NETs (IPNETs) and highlight the necessity of developing guidelines for management of these patients. A strict correlation between tumor size and malignancy of these tumors was demonstrated in the single-center retrospective Italian study of Bettini and col. , which included all patients with NF PNETs who underwent curative (R0) resection during 18 years.

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms originating from neuroendocrine cells located throughout the body. They secret various peptides and cause various symptoms (carcinoid syndrome) or not. The incidence of NETs was not well-known till recently when Yao et al. and Hausa et al. published their surveys of NETs using data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and from the Norwegian Registry of Cancer (NRC). The incidence of NETs in Taiwan by using the Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) data was increased from 0.3 to 1.51 per 100,000 from 1996 to 2008. The increased incidence for NET worldwide probably was partially due to the awareness and improvement of diagnostic technology. Compared with the incidence in western countries, the incidence of NET is much lower in Taiwan. And the incidence of NETs in Asian Pacific Islanders was also lower than the whites and blacks in US. Gastroenteral-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs), accounting for half to two thirds of all NETs, is the most common site of NETs. As the progress in the understanding of pathophysiology for GEP-NET, there are two novel targeted agents shown to be effective for the treatment of GEP-NET. Meanwhile, response to mTOR inhibitor was better for Asian than Caucasian in the phase III study using everolimus for advanced pancreatic NETs. These information suggests that there is racial difference for either genetic or environmental risk factors and these factors result in different incidence and/or clinical outcome. Currently, there is limited data for thorough epidemiologic study in Taiwan. The aim of this study is to collect clinical information for GEP-NET, and survey the prognostic factors for GEP-NET in Taiwan. the investigators suppose that this epidemiologic study would provide a database potentially to improve the diagnosis, and treatment of GEP-NET. This study plans to include 600 GEP-NET patients. NET patients diagnosed after 2011.1.1 is included in this study.\n\nFurthermore, the investigators will provide the check of immunohistochemical staining for the tumor tissue of GEP-NET patients, including the functioning status (insulinoma, glucagonoma, gastrinoma, VIPoma) and the degree of differentiation, the expression of SSTR2 or SSTR5 and the check of possible primary site for unknown primary NET patients.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine cancer.",

These tumors arise from special cells called neuroendocrine cells, which are found in these organs and release hormones to regulate various bodily functions. GEP-NETs can be slow-growing, and symptoms may vary depending on their location and size.\n\nAcromegaly is a condition where a person's body produces too much growth hormone. This excess hormone can cause certain body parts, like the hands, feet, and face, to enlarge over time. It typically occurs because of a tumor on the pituitary gland in the brain, which is responsible for regulating hormones. Acromegaly can lead to various health issues if not treated, but medications or surgery can often help manage the condition.\n\nLong-acting somatostatin analogs (LA-SSAs) are indicated for patients with Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and acromegaly who are not eligible for surgery or when surgery fails to achieve remission.\n\nData for this study will be collected after the treatment switch from the Ipsen lanreotide syringe to the Pharmathen lanreotide syringe has occurred, using one round of one-to-one qualitative telephone and/or videoconference interviews with patients.

Alkylating agents (ALKY) are one of the main systemic treatments used, at least for advanced duodeno-pancreatic NETs, with a response rate of 30 to 40% and a median progression-free survival of 4 to 18 months. Chemotherapy is one of the few therapeutic weapons, along with everolimus, somatostatin analogs, and metabolic radiotherapy, for lung NETs, called typical and atypical carcinoids, even if the level of proof of efficacy for these treatments is lower than for duodeno-pancreatic NETs. Considering the available retrospective data, O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) appears to be a predictive factor of the response to ALKY. Oxaliplatin (OX) has demonstrated an interesting activity, with response rates between 17% and 30%. In a first retrospective study we showed that Gemox is effective in NET, and more recently that its activity is similar to that of ALKYs, but without being influenced by the MGMT status. Prospective studies are needed but our data suggests that ALKY should be offered first to patients with methylated MGMT tumors while Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy should be offered first to patients with unmethylated MGMT tumors.\n\nIn this project, we wish to evaluate the contribution of the MGMT methylation, evaluated in the tumor, in predicting the Objective Response (OR) in patients treated with ALKY and to evaluate a treatment with alkylating agents versus Oxaliplatin in patients with a duodeno-pancreatic or lung or unknown primitive NET.",

Neuroendocrine cancers: Atypical bronchial carcinoid, neuroendocrine carcinoma and Grade 3 NETs independent of primary site (SCLC excluded)\n2. Biliary tract cancers: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma\n3. Gynaecological malignancies: Ovarian clear cell carcinoma, uterine clear cell carcinoma, uterine/ovarian carcinosarcoma, uterine leiomyosarcoma and vaginal/vulva squamous cell carcinoma\n4. Mismatch repair protein deficient (MSI-H) cancers (excluding colorectal carcinoma).\n\nThe role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.\n\nThis protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of nivolumab \\& ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 2 clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in immunotherapy sensitive rare cancers. This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) \\>6 months and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, patients are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. CA209-538 examined this treatment combination in three 'baskets' of rare cancers: rare upper gastrointestinal, gynaecological and neuroendocrine cancers. The cancers on study all individually had an incidence of \\<2/100000/year. The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of rare cancer patients. Given the success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a range of different cancer types, it was postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. CA209-538 enrolled 120 rare cancer patients on study, clinical benefit rate was \\>30% across all baskets, long term survival follow-up is underway.\n\nThis study will enrol 240 participants, across 4 cohorts with histotypes which demonstrated clinical benefit on CA209-538. All participants will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy.",

      "brief_summary": "This study is designed to identify the best tolerated doses of \\[131\\]Iodine-MIBG and \\[90\\]Yttrium-DOTATOC when co-administered to treat midgut neuroendocrine tumors. These drugs (131I-MIBG, 90Y-DOTATOC) are radioactive drugs, known as radionuclide therapy. Currently, the safest and best tolerated doses of these drugs (when combined together) is unknown.",
      "detailed_description": "\\[131\\]Iodine-MIBG and \\[90\\]Yttrium-DOTATOC are radioactive drugs designed to treat specific tumor cells. These drugs are a combination of the radiation (131-Iodine, 90-Yttrium) and a protein that targets the tumor cell (MIBG or DOTATOC). Because these proteins are attracted to, and stick to, the tumor, the radiation is centered in the tumors. This kills more tumor cells and minimizes radiation-damage to healthy tissues, like the heart and lungs.\n\nTwo organs still absorb some of the radiation, though: bone marrow and the kidney. These organs limit how much radiation can be given to tumors, but we don't know how much radiation is too much. Too much radiation to bone marrow can result in anemia. Too much radiation to the kidneys can result in kidney failure. From prior radiation therapies, we have a general idea of how much radiation we can give safely.\n\n131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC have never been given together. We want to give them together because many times, tumors are actually groups of different types of cells. This means, not all the cells respond to therapy the same way. If some tumor cells survive therapy, the tumor will continue to grow and eventually come back. We know some mid-gut neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have targets for DOTATOC and some other mid-gut NETs have targets for MIBG. We also have now identified that some people with mid-gut NETs have different tumors: some with targets for MIBG and some with targets for DOTATOC. For these people, this means treating only with 131I-MIBG or 90Y-DOTATOC will not be enough to treat their cancer. They need both radioactive drugs.\n\nBecause we are combining these radioactive drugs, this study is known as a first-in-man study. We are also using a special imaging to help us estimate the radiation dose to the bone marrow and to the kidneys. This is what decides the final dose of 131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC.\n\nBefore receiving therapy, participants will be asked to undergo imaging to verify they have both MIBG and DOTATOC tumor types:\n\n* participants are given very small doses of radioactive drugs\n* a special camera (SPECT/CT) collects images (scans)\n* imaging (scans) are done over 3 calendar days\n* blood samples are taken at that time, too, to measure the circulating amount of tracer doses\n\nIf the scans show a participant has both MIBG and DOTATOC tumors, therapy is given:\n\n* a customized dose of 90Y-DOTATOC is given on day 1 of a treatment cycle. This is given outpatient.\n* a customized dose of 131I-MIBG is given on day 2 of a treatment cycle. This is given inpatient (admitted to the hospital).\n* participants are monitored through blood tests to identify the side effects of therapy.\n\nEach participant can have up to 2 cycles of therapy. The cycles are 12 weeks apart.\n\nThe doses for 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I-MIBG are decided based on radiation to the bone marrow and radiation to the kidney. Doses are decided by how well other participants have done on this study.\n\nParticipants have life long follow-up for this study. This is very important, because a study like this has not been done.",

      "brief_summary": "Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) are a sub-group of aggressive neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN). The most common primary sites are broncho-pulmonary and digestive. The gastroentero-pancreatic NECs (GEP-NEC) represent 7-21% of all of the NENs.\n\nRecent data on the initial presentation of GEP-NEC have been reported in two retrospective studies and a French cohort study. No standard second-line treatment has been defined for NECs. Despite a very negative prognosis, these NECs have a certain amount of chemosensitivity, close to that of bronchial NECs. Multiple-drug therapies such as Folfiri, or Folfox, or single drug treatments such as temozolomide are the proposed options but with a low level of proof Bevacizumab associated with a cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown promising results in well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET), known for being hypervascular. The efficacy of bevacizumab has also been suggested in patients with NEC, but never in the context of a phase II study. Its combination with Folfiri is efficient and well tolerated in metastatic colorectal cancer. The combination Folfiri-bevacizumab potentially represents an optimized treatment compared to chemotherapy with only Folfiri. No phase II or III studies have reported results for these patients, and no on-going phase II or III trial have been identified to date.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to show that, after the failure of a first-line chemotherapy using platinum-etoposide, the combination Folfiri-bevacizumab allows significant prolongation of overall survival in adult patients with GEP-NEC.",

      "detailed_description": "Rationale: The majority of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients present with metastases, most often including liver metastases. These patients have a poorer prognosis and lower quality of life.\n\nCurrently, intravenous administered somatostatin-bound radionuclides (177Lu-dotatate) have shown to improve tumor response rates and progression free survival (PFS). Despite of the increased tumor response rate and PFS, liver metastases still remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Patients with liver metastases have a worse outcome in terms of overall survival after treatment with 177Lu-dotatate compared to patients with limited or no liver metastases.\n\nObjective: to investigate the impact of intra-arterial (IA) administration of 177Lu-dotatate on the intrahepatic biodistribution in patients with NET liver metastases. Our primary objective is to evaluate if there is a difference in post-treatment tumor-to-non-tumor (T/N) activity concentration ratio on SPECT/CT between the intra-arterial treated liver lobe and the intravenous treated liver lobe.\n\nStudy design: Multicenter, interventional, block randomized, phase 2 clinical trial. We use a within-subject controlled design where the administration of 177Lu-dotatate is randomized between the right or left hepatic artery. Selective IA administration of 177Lu-dotatate allows for intra-patient comparison between IA administration (one lobe) versus IV 'administration' (the other lobe). The contralateral liver lobe and the rest of the body receive treatment by second pass IV route.\n\nStudy population: 26 patients with NET liver metastases (\\> 18 years old). Intervention: Treatment will be randomized between selective right or left hepatic artery administration of 177Lu-dotatate (Four administrations of 7.4 GBq; each via the same randomly allocated hepatic artery during angiography).\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: To assess if there is a difference in post-treatment tumor-to-non-tumor (T/N) activity concentration ratio on SPECT/CT between the intra-arterial treated liver lobe and the intravenous treated liver lobe. The T/N activity concentration will be measured on SPECT/CT. The primary endpoint will be assessed after the first treatment cycle. The T/N activity ratios of the second, third, and final treatment cycle will be assessed as secondary endpoint. Tumor response, toxicity, extrahepatic uptake and kidney uptake are secondary endpoints. Intra- and inter-patient differences will be studied.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: As with the standard IV treatment with 177Lu-dotatate, the treatment consists of four cycles. During each cycle, patients will be admitted for 1 night and undergo physical examination, laboratory examination, angiography with administration of the treatment dose, and post-treatment imaging. Risks include standard complication risks related to angiography (bleeding or infection). No additional risks with relation to the treatment itself are expected compared to the standard IV treatment (nausea, vomiting).",

At present, it is not possible to distinguish whether a small lymph-node is site of metastases or not without performing frozen sections. In a previous study ex-vivo from European Institute of Oncology SI-NET presented a high uptake of a beta-emitting radiotracer, 90Y-DOTA-TOC. Five SI-NET showing SSR positivity at PET with 68Ga DOTA-TOC received 5 mCi of 90Y-DOTA-TOC the day before surgery.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Liver-directed therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial embolization, yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization, and cryoablation may help activate the immune system in order to shrink tumors that are not being directly targeted. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is a form of targeted treatment that is performed by the use of a small molecule, which carries a radioactive component attached to a peptide. Once injected into the body, this small molecule binds to some specific sites on tumor cells called receptors and emit medium energy radiation that can destroy cells. Because this radionuclide is attached to the peptide, which binds receptors on tumor lesions, the radiation can preferably be targeted to the tumor cells in order to destroy them. Giving pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy may work better than pembrolizumab alone.",

      "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS\n\nBackground\n\nNeuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that can arise at any site in the gastrointestinal tract, that are known by their ability to over express somatostatin receptors. Originally called carcinoid tumours, these tumours are rising in incidence. In patients with incurable disease, several systemic options have demonstrated activity but few have been compared in prospective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs). 177Lu-Octreotate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and CAPTEM have shown promising activity in initial single arm trials. Prospective RCTs are needed to build on these early trials to determine the optimal role of these therapies in clinical practice.\n\nCONTROL NETs is a parallel group phase II randomised open label trial of Lutetium-177 Octreotate (177Lu-Octreotate (Lutate)) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and capecitabine (CAP)/temozolomide (TEM) chemotherapy (chemotherapy): (i) versus CAPTEM alone in the treatment of low to intermediate grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs); (ii) versus PRRT alone in the treatment of low to intermediate grade midgut neuroendocrine tumours (mNETs).\n\nGeneral aim\n\ni) To determine the relative activity of CAPTEM/PRRT in biopsy-proven, low to intermediate grade, unresectable, metastatic 68Ga-octreotate PET-avid NETs in the following parallel phase II studies: Group A: pNETs and Group B: mNETs.\n\nii) To inform future comparative phase III RCTs to determine the optimal therapies in pNETs and mNETs.\n\nDesign\n\nTwo parallel non-comparative group randomised, controlled, multi-centre phase II, 2 arm open-label controlled trials with 2:1 allocation (experimental : control)\n\n1. Study A: pNETs: PRRT/CAPTEM vs. CAPTEM (control)\n2. Study B: mNETs: PRRT/CAPTEM vs. PRRT (control)\n\nRandomisation will be performed using the method of minimisation.\n\nPatients will be stratified by:\n\n* Previous systemic therapy regimens (0,1 v 2)\n* WHO tumour grade: Low Grade - G1 (Ki67\\<3% (mitotic count \\<2)) vs. Intermediate Grade - G2 (Ki67 3-20% (mitotic count 2-20))\n* visceral only vs. visceral with bone metastases\n* Treating institution\n\nPopulation\n\nThe target population for this study is consenting adult patients with advanced, unresectable low or intermediate grade (Ki-67\\<20%) midgut neuroendocrine tumours (mNETs) or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs ), who have received ≤ 2 prior systemic therapies for advanced unresectable disease (including long acting somatostatin analogues).\n\nAssessments\n\n* Patients will be assessed at each treatment cycle for toxicity\n* CT including a 3 phase contrast CT of the liver will be undertaken at baseline, then every 2 months (pNET) or every 4 months (pNET) until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1.\n* 68Ga-DOTATATE PET CT Scan will be undertaken at baseline, then every 4 months until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1.\n* 18F-FDG PET Scan may be performed at the discretion of treating clinician at baseline, then every 2 months until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1) for G2 NETS.\n* 24-h whole-body planar gamma imaging will be undertaken on the day after administration of PRRT (every 2 months).\n* Serum biomarkers will be undertaken every 4 months until disease progression.\n* Quality of life assessments will be undertaken at every 2 months until disease progression using QLC C30 and QLQ-GINET21.\n* Health utilities will be evaluated with EQ-5D-5L every 2 months until completion of study follow up.\n\nStatistical considerations\n\nBoth studies are based on a Simon's two-stage design and are randomised using a 2:1 randomisation (Experimental: Control). A mix of approximately 30% G1 patients and 70% G2 patients is expected.\n\nStudy A, pNETs (n=90) will have 80% power with 95% confidence interval to exclude a 12 months PFS of 60% in favour of a more interesting rate of 77% in the experimental arm.\n\nFor Study B, mNETs (n=75), the PFS at 24 months in the control arm is expected to be 52%. Thus study B will have 80% power with 95% confidence interval to demonstrate a PFS rate at 24 months of 70% in experimental arm, a result that would warrant further investigation.\n\nA total sample size of 165 patients for the two studies will be accrued over 2 years.\n\nPatients will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years.",

      "brief_summary": "There is currently no standard treatment beyond first-line etoposide/platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with progressive poorly differentiated extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma. Therefore the treatment of patients whose disease progresses on or after this first-line treatment is an area of unmet need.\n\nCombination regimens such as irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid are a second-line treatment option currently used in Europe and world-wide for this subset of patients. However, there is currently no trial evidence supporting this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\nResults of the NAPOLI-1 phase III trial of liposomal irinotecan in the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma after gemcitabine-based therapy reported improved survival for those patients who received a combination of liposomal irinotecan with 5-FU/folinic acid compared to those patients who received 5-FU/folinic acid alone. Liposomal irinotecan has been found to show an improved distribution into tumour tissue in comparison to irinotecan, and this may have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nDocetaxel is standardly used as a second-line treatment option in patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed on primary etoposide-platinum combination therapy. Therefore this drug could also have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma as the biology of the disease is similar to small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe overall aim of the NET-02 trial is to select a treatment for continuation to a Phase III trial. The intention of the trial is to determine whether liposomal irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid and docetaxel are sufficiently active in this population of patients. If both treatments are found to be efficacious, selection criteria will be applied to select a treatment to take forward.\n\n102 eligible participants will be randomised to receive either liposomal irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid given every 14 days, or docetaxel given every 21 days. Participants will be treated for a minimum of 6 months or until discontinuation of treatment as per protocol.",
