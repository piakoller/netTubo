      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n- Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) come from cells of the hormonal and nervous systems. Some people have surgery to shrink the tumor. Sometimes the tumors come back. Researchers think that treatment with drugs based on knowing the defective gene might give better results.\n\nObjective:\n\n- To see if drugs selected based on the defective gene result in better tumor response. The drugs are Sunitinib and Everolimus.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- People age 18 and older with an advanced low- or intermediate-grade gastrointestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with:\n* Medical history\n* Physical exam\n* Scans\n* Blood, urine, and lab tests\n* The study team will see if participants should have surgery.\n* If yes, participants will:\n* Sign a separate consent\n* Have computed tomography (CT) scan before and after surgery\n* Have as much of the tumor removed as possible. A small piece will be tested for mutation type.\n* If no, participants will have a small piece of tumor removed for the testing.\n* If the surgery might cure them, the participant will leave the study. The other participants will be assigned to take either Sunitinib or Everolimus.\n* Participants will take their drug by mouth once a day. They will keep a medicine diary. Some will keep track of their blood pressure at least weekly.\n* Screening tests may be repeated at study visits. Participants also may have their heart evaluated.\n* About 30 days after the last day of their study drug, participants will have a follow-up visit that repeats the screening tests.\n* Participants will be contacted every 3 months after this visit.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas are a rare and heterogeneous group of neoplasms with unique tumor biology, natural history, and clinical management issues.\n* Most NETs are sporadic, but they can be part of familial cancer syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.\n* Well-differentiated, low or intermediate grade NETs have a heterogeneous natural history.\n* Surgery is the only curative treatment option in patients with localized early stage NETs.\n* The optimal management strategy for patients with advanced NETs is unknown.\n* The majority of NETs have somatic mutations in MEN1 and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B), and genes involved in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and/or overexpression of growth factors and their receptors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) that can be targeted for therapy.\n* Survival in patients with NETs and somatic mutations is better than patients with wild type NETs.\n* Sunitinib (multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and Everolimus (mTOR signaling pathway inhibitor) are currently approved for the treatment of progressive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic NETs.\n* However, mutation targeted therapy with Sunitinib or Everolimus has not been studied in this patient population.\n* The present proposal aims to determine if mutation targeting therapy for patients with advanced low- or intermediate grade NETs is more effective than historically expected results.\n\nObjectives:\n\n-To determine the progression-free survival in patients with NETs of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas treated with Sunitinib or Everolimus based on tumor genotyping.\n\nEligibility:\n\n-Patients with:\n\n* progressive, histologically or cytologically diagnosed low or intermediate grade locally advanced or metastatic NETs.\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years\n\nDesign:\n\n* Phase II open labeled clinical trial.\n* Tumor biopsy for tumor genotyping will be performed if the patient does not have archival tissue available and does not have MEN1, VHL or NF1.\n* Patients with somatic or germline mutations in MEN1/PDGFR/KIT/FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 will be treated with Sunitinib. (Arm 1)\n* Patients with somatic/germline mutations in NF1/PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/VHL will be treated with Everolimus. (Arm 2)\n* Patients with wildtype tumor will be treated with Sunitinib. (Arm 1)\n* Patients who have disease-progression on either Sunitinib or Everolimus will cross-over to the other drug.\n* Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.\n* Up to 120 patients will be accrued to the study. It is anticipated that 20-30 patients per year may enroll into this trial; thus accrual may be completed in 4-5 years.",

NOTE: In case one or both of these thresholds are exceeded, the patient can only be included after initiation of appropriate lipid lowering medication;\n8. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) or partners of WOCBP participating in this study must agree to use highly effective contraception while on treatment and for at least 8 weeks after end of treatment, because the effects of Sunitinib and Everolimus on the developing human fetus are unknown.

In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.\n9. Must have fully recovered from toxicities of any prior treatment with cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy, surgery, or other anti-cancer modalities (returned to baseline status as noted before most recent treatment or less than or equal grade 1).\n10.

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Sunitinib or Everolimus, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with Sunitinib or Everolimus.\n* Current treatment with therapeutic doses of Coumadin-derivative anticoagulants (low dose Coumadin up to 2 mg by mouth (PO) daily for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis is allowed).\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with study agents.\n* Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract or malabsorption syndrome, or the inability to take oral medication\n* Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as defined by hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) \\>8% despite adequate therapy. Patients with a known history or diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are on therapy and have had good blood sugar control may be included, even if the HbA1c is \\> 8% because this value can take up to 3-4 months to normalize\n* Patients who have received live attenuated vaccines within 1 week of start of Everolimus and during the study. Patient should also avoid close contact with others who have received live attenuated vaccines. Examples of live attenuated vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines\n* Patients who are on chronic treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents (topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed)\n* Patients with a history of non-compliance to medical regimens or who are considered potentially unreliable or will not be able to complete the entire study\n* Patients who are taking medications that are strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 AA4 (CYP3A4) or PgP and need to remain on these medications.
