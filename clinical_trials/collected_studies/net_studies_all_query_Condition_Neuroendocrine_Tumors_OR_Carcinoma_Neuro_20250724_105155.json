In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors have activity against a variety of tumor types. Carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor with a favorable safety profile that has been studied in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. Carfilzomib received accelerated approval from the U.S. FDA in 2012, based on a favorable response rate, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who received at least two prior therapies, and demonstrated disease progression within 60 days of completing the last therapy. In this multi-center study, the investigators propose to evaluate carfilzomib for the treatment of patients with advanced neuroendocrine cancers.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well berzosertib (M6620) works when given in combination with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) compared with topotecan alone in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has come back (relapsed), or small cell cancer that arises from a site other than the lung (extrapulmonary). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work by damaging the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in tumor cells, causing those cells to die and the tumor to shrink. However, some tumor cells can become less affected by chemotherapy because they have ways to repair the damaged DNA. The addition of M6620 could help topotecan hydrochloride shrink the cancer and prevent it from returning by blocking enzymes needed for DNA repair.",

To determine if the combination of berzosertib (M6620) with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) will result in an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to topotecan alone in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) with the combination of M6220 and topotecan in patients with relapsed SCLC and extrapulmonary small cell cancers.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis are not eligible due to their extremely poor prognosis and since it is unclear whether the investigational agent penetrates the blood-brain barrier. However, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days may be enrolled\n* Patients who have received prior topotecan therapy\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n  * Note: Patients who have had palliative radiotherapy may be included as long as they have recovered from any radiotherapy related adverse events (allow at least a week between radiotherapy completion and study treatment)\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy except hair loss and peripheral neuropathy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1)\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to M6620 or topotecan used in study\n* M6620 is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) should be avoided. Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or of which to minimize use. The Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card should be provided to patients. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 as a DDR inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620. These potential risks may also apply to topotecan used in this study\n* Patients with high grade neuroendocrine cancers, but with no small cell morphology will not be eligible\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome will not be eligible",

Evaluate the best overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (investigator-reported).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n1. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab-based therapy in this patient population.\n2. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in participants receiving pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.\n3. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in participants treated with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (median PFS and 18 wk PFS).\n4. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in participants receiving pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPart A: Participants are treated with pembrolizumab alone. An adaptive Simon's two-stage design was used, and the overall plan hinges on the activity of single agent pembrolizumab in the first stage of Part A. If there is sufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will expand to the second stage of Part A and forgo Part B. If there is insufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will proceed to the first stage of Part B (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy).\n\nPart B: Participants are treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (physician's choice, paclitaxel or irinotecan). Patients with stable disease (SD) or better after 9 cycles (27 weeks) of pembrolizumab-based therapy will have the option to continue with pembrolizumab alone, unless the first partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) is noted at 27 weeks.\n\nAll participants will undergo a pre-treatment tumor biopsy (unless the tumor is inaccessible and/or a biopsy is not felt to be in the participant's best interest). Participants may continue study treatment until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable adverse events, inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the participant, the participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, participant receives 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment.",

There is no limit to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received. Progressive disease should have been documented before entry into the study.\n* Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as greater than 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than 10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n* Target lesions cannot be selected within previously irradiated areas, if not newly arising or clearly progressing after irradiation as proven by repeat scanning.\n* Patients must have recovered from toxicity related to prior therapy to at least to grade 1 (defined by CTCAE 3.0 until December 31, 2010, and by CTCAE 4.0 beginning January 1, 2011) and must not have had major surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy (including any investigational agents), or hormonal therapy (other than replacement), within 4 weeks prior to entering the study.\n* Concurrent corticosteroids for myasthenia gravis, or other paraneoplastic syndromes which often accompany thymic malignancies are allowed. Inhaled steroids are also allowed. However since steroids might occasionally induce responses in thymic malignancies patients should be on a stable dose of steroids for greater than or equal to 8 weeks before enrollment in order not to confound the efficacy assessment.\n* Age greater than 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of IMC-A12 in patients less than 16 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 1 single-agent trials.\n* Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.\n* Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function (as defined below).

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to comply with intravenous administration schedule, and the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nINCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:\n\nBoth men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Every effort will be made to recruit women and minorities in this study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 3 months without steroids may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.\n* Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate, provided their blood glucose is within the normal range (fasting less than 120 mg/dL or below institutional upper limit of normal) and if they are on a stable dietary or therapeutic regimen for this condition.\n* Uncontrolled medical illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or uncontrolled, symptomatic congestive heart failure (American Heart Association (AHA) Class II or worse), uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients with poorly controlled viral loads (viral load greater than 50 copies HIV/ml), and/or AIDS-defining illnesses will be excluded due to the possibility that IMC-A12 may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events with respect to IMC-A12. HIV positive patients with thymic malignancies not meeting the above criteria can be considered for inclusion in the study.\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n* History of another invasive malignancy in the last five years. Adequately treated non-invasive, non-melanoma skin cancers, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, and surgically-removed papillary thyroid cancer will be allowed.\n* Prior treatment with drugs of the IGF-1R inhibitor class.\n* Patients with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy as assessed by the investigator.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because IMC-A12 is a monoclonal antibody to IGF-1R with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. IgG antibody may also potentially be secreted in milk and therefore breastfeeding women should be excluded.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to IMC-A12.",

      "brief_summary": "The incidence of new diagnosed patients with NET of the digestive tract including carcinoid and pancreatic islet cells tumors ranges from 2 to 10 per 100,000 in the western Countries (Kulke M, Mayer R. N Engl J Med 340:858-868, 1999). Despite of the low incidence, the prevalence of these tumors is high because of their relatively long survival estimated in 35% at 5 years for those patients with well or moderate differentiated tumors (Yao JC, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2008;26:3063-3072). In fact, digestive NETs are the second most prevalent tumors derived from the digestive tract after colorectal carcinoma.\n\nNETs are characterized by abundant vasculature, moreover VEGFR and VEGFR are overexpressed in 60-84% of the carcinoids and pancreatic islet cells NETs (Zhang et al. Cancer 2007;109:1478-1486). Other pro-angiogenic factors like the platelet derived growth factor (PDGFR) have been also involved in NET progression and development (Chaudhry A, et al.Cancer Res 1992;52:1006-12).\n\nPazopanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the VEGFR, PDGFR and KIT with a dual activity both as an antiangiogenic and also and anti-tumoral agent (Kumar et al. Mol Cancer Ther2007;6:2012-2021, Hurwitz et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:4220-4227). Pazopanib seems to have a better toxicity profile versus the other antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors and has already shown activity in several tumor types like renal cell carcinoma (Sternberg et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 5021), soft tissue sarcomas (Sleijfer et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:3126-32), hepatocellular carcinoma (Yau et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3561), colorectal cancer (Brady et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst.4133), and thyroid cancers (Bible et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3521).\n\nThe Spanish Group for Research in Neuroendocrine Tumors (GETNE) group is an active Member inside of the GENET group and has a large tradition in clinical trials in NETs. The investigators hypothesize that pazopanib may have at least as good activity and better safety profile than other VEGFR inhibitors in progressive advanced or metastatic NET tumors derived from the digestive tract.",

The primary objective of the study is to determine the radiologic response rate to this regimen in progressive, metastatic, differentiated neuroendocrine cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumor (NET) is a classification that has evolved over time to include a group of related tumors which all originate from neuroendocrine cells. This group includes carcinoid tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs), catecholamine-secreting tumors (e.g. pheochromocytomas), medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and small cell lung cancer. Carcinoid tumors are mostly derived from serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells, occuring most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract (67.5%) and the bronchopulmonary system (25.3%). Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) arise from the several types of pancreatic islet cells, which manifest as insulinomas, somatostatinomas or glucagonomas. NETs are broadly classified as functional or nonfunctional, as determined by whether plasma hormone elevation and endocrine symptoms occur. NETs are classified into two groups: 1) rapidly growing anaplastic small cell cancers such as small cell lung cancer and small cell carcinomas of the GI tract and 2) slow growing, more differentiated NETs such as carcinoid and PET.\n\nIn total, an estimated 12,000 - 15,000 cases of NETs (not counting small cell carcinomas) are diagnosed in the United States annually. The incidence of carcinoid tumors alone is estimated to be 2 per 100,000 in the United States (5,400 cases/yr/U.S.). PETs are less common, with about 1,000 new cases per year in the United States. Carcinoids and PETs are potentially curable by surgical resection; the 5-year survival rates in patients with localized carcinoid is 78.2%. However, these tumors are frequently indolent in their growth and patients often present with unresectable or metastatic disease (80% of all cases). The hormonal symptoms that may accompany their disease, as exemplified by carcinoid syndrome, complicate the management of these patients. Hormonal therapy, namely octreotide, is used to relieve symptoms and has been reported to have a response rate of 1-5% by itself. Metastatic disease is associated with significantly worse prognosis; carcinoid patients with visceral metastases have a 5-year survival rate of 38.5%. Based on the efficacy of the combination of cisplatin and etoposide in treating small cell lung cancer, these agents have been explored in the treatment of pancreatic islet cell tumors and carcinoids. In general, etoposide-cisplatin regimens have poor response rates for the slow growing, differentiated NET group with an average response rate of 7-10%. Furthermore, these cisplatin-etoposide regimens have been associated with significant toxicities, including frequent severe neutropenia, ototoxicity, neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.\n\nAn Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial of patients with metastatic or unresectable progressive pancreatic islet cell tumors, including poorly and well-differentiated PETs, showed that a regimen of streptozocin and doxorubicin had a significantly superior objective response rate compared to a combination of streptozocin and fluorouracil (69 versus 45%, p=0.05). The study used a definition for objective response that included regression of the tumor mass, regression of malignant tumor causing hepatomegaly or a reduction in excessive hormone production. Streptozocin-doxorubicin was also significantly superior to streptozocin-fluorouracil in terms of median time to tumor progression and of median overall survival (2.2 versus 1.4 years, p=0.004). However, significant toxicity was associated with either streptozocin-based regimen with roughly 80% in either arm experiencing vomiting that lasted throughout the 5-day course of streptozocin per cycle. Additionally, Grade 3/4 leukopenia occurred in 25% of patients who received streptozocin-fluorouracil, with one treatment-related death secondary to leukopenia complicated by sepsis. Notably, streptozocin has significant renal toxicity causing significant proteinuria. Thus, the doubtful efficacy of streptozocin-based combinations and the significant associated toxicity has limited the role of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment of differentiated NETs.\n\nIn the lab, the investigators have found that capecitabine (5-DFUR), an oral pro-drug for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and temozolomide were synergistic for induction of apoptosis in 2 human NET cell lines. The mechanism and pathways involved are under investigation, but it was found to be important for the synergism that temozolomide be exposed to the NET cell lines during the end of the capecitabine exposure. The team believes that the combination of temozolomide and capecitabine will prove to be an effective regimen. Our hypothesis is that the DNA damage induced by capecitabine by incorporation of 5-FdUTP into DNA and reducing thymidine pools by inhibition of thymidylate synthase via 5-FdUMP will synergistically potentiate the effect of temozolomide as an alkylator by reducing the repair activity of O6-alkylguanyl-alkyl-transferase (O6-AGAT). O6-AGAT is a DNA repair enzyme which removes temozolomide-alkylated groups from guanine. A 5-day regimen of temozolomide is vital to decreasing O6-AGAT levels by direct binding which leads to a suicide inactivation of O6-AGAT-mediated DNA repair. This saturates O6-AGAT after 23 days of temozolomide, thus allowing the last 23 days of dosing to induce alkylation of DNA and thereby induce apoptosis. The investigators found that cells with prior 5-FU exposure were more sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by temozolomide.\n\nAnother fundamental rationale and hypothesis which the investigators have developed into the synthesis of a novel regimen for NET is based upon cytokinetics and p53. NET are characteristically very slow growing, yet fatal, cancers with the great majority of them having wild type p53. Therefore, their drug resistance is probably not based upon mutational p53 causes because of the wild type p53 status but rather upon their slow cytokinetics. The best way to kill slow growing tumors with a long interval in G0 phase is with lipophilic alkylators (i.e. Temodar) and utilizing continuous exposure to antimetabolites such as Xeloda or continuous infusion 5-FU. Xeloda's half-life is 11 hrs so q 12 hr dosing is roughly equivalent to continuous infusion. The investigators believe that the hypothesis is correct and well grounded in pharmacologic and cell cycle principles.\n\nThe investigators have to date pilot experience of ten patients who received capecitabine, total of 1500 mg/m2/day/PO, for fourteen days, with temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2 given on the last five days of their course of capecitabine. All of our initial 10 patients with progressive, differentiated NET have had dramatic symptomatic pain relief and at least 75% reduction in their tumor markers. Five patients had metastatic carcinoid and 5 had metastatic pancreatic NET. All patients had progressive liver metastases, all 10 patients had failed octreotide therapy with long acting somatostatin, and 7/10 had failed prior chemotherapy regimens. One carcinoid patient had a complete response (CR) proven by surgery and is now without any tumor recurrence 22 months out from surgery and chemotherapy. Three patients had a partial response (PR) and one patient had a minor response (MR) in their liver metastases. Two other patients experienced stable disease (SD) for 6 and 8 months while on therapy. The overall response rate proven by CT or MRI scans (CR, PR and MR) is 50% to date. Overall, clinical benefit of this lab based regimen occurred in 7/10 patients (CR, PR, MR and SD).

      "detailed_description": "This study consisted of a Screening period, conducted up to 4 months before randomisation, followed by three phases: a 16-week, double blind (DB), randomised, placebo-controlled phase; a 32-week initial open label (IOL) phase; and a long term open label extension (LTOLE) phase.\n\nThe DB phase evaluated lanreotide Autogel versus placebo in subjects with a history of carcinoid syndrome (flushing and/or diarrhoea). This was followed by a 32-week IOL phase in which all subjects received lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks. Subjects in countries where lanreotide Autogel had not been approved for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome, who were well-controlled at the end of the 32-week IOL phase and chose to continue to receive lanreotide Autogel, were given the option of participating in a LTOLE phase. The LTOLE phase of the study was planned to end at least 2 years after the last subject had completed his/her participation in the 32-week IOL phase or when marketing approval for the treatment of symptoms of carcinoid syndrome had been obtained in the respective countries (whichever occurred first) or at any time the study was terminated by the Sponsor. The actual overall duration of the study was 6.5 years. During the LTOLE phase all subjects continued to be treated with lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks.\n\nThe study planned to enrol approximately 100 adult subjects worldwide. Screening continued until 115 subjects were enrolled in the study.",

NET are highly vascular tumors, and high VEGF expression has been correlated with worse clinical and pathological characteristics as well as poor prognosis. A novel antiangiogenic approach relies on targeting not only the endothelial cells but also rendering them more sensitive to VEGFR blockade by achieving pericyte detachment. In this study, the dose of sorafenib will be titrated up to a maximum of 800mg BID based on patients' toxicity and on a novel pharmacodynamic assay that measures inhibition of molecular target(PDGFR) in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dual VEGFR targeting is achieved by administering sorafenib plus metronomic low dose cyclophosphamide.",

Everolimus has been recently approved for its use in advanced pNETs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in Europe by the European Medical Agency (EMA).\n\nA randomized study is needed to have a clear knowledge about the best sequence for its administration; this is, before or after palliative chemotherapy.\n\nThere may or may not be any benefits from giving first each other treatment of the study. The information obtained from this study will help the physician improve the treatment and management of patients with advanced pNET.\n\nThis study was planned to compare STZ-5FU chemotherapy followed by everolimus upon progression versus the reverse sequence. However sequential studies with pNETs are hard to be managed in terms of time and costs. Therefore the protocol was amended to have PFS1 (progression free survival after course 1) as primary endpoint and PFS2 (i.e. progression free survival after both STZ based chemotherapy and Everolimus or the reverse order) as secondary endpoint. This information will be extremely valuable for the day to day clinical practice of pNETs oncologists",

      "detailed_description": "RAD001 is a new drug that is designed to block a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. Octreotide Depot is FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome and hormonal symptoms from certain islet cell carcinomas. Octreotide Depot may also help to block certain proteins that are important in tumor growth.\n\nBefore you can start treatment on the study, you will have what are called \"screening tests\". These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. You will be asked questions about your medical history and about any medications you are currently taking or have taken in the past. You will have a complete physical exam and your heart rate, temperature, breathing rate, blood pressure, height, and weight will be measured. You will be asked about your ability to perform every day activities. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart) and scans (either Computed Tomography/CT or Magnetic Resonance Imaging/MRI) to evaluate the cancer. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.\n\nIf the screening evaluations show you are eligible to take part in the study, you may begin treatment. You will take RAD001 by mouth once a day, every day while on study. You should take it in a fasting state or after no more than a light, fat-free meal. You should take RAD001 about the same time each day. Octreotide Depot will be given as an injection into the muscle of either buttock once every 4 weeks while on study. This will be done at M. D. Anderson. Four weeks (28 days) is called one course of treatment.\n\nClinic visits will occur every 2 weeks during the first 4 weeks and every 4 weeks from then on. At each clinic visit, you will be asked questions about your medical history and about any medications you are currently taking or have taken in the past. You will have a complete physical exam and your heart rate, temperature, breathing rate, blood pressure, height, and weight will be measured. You will be asked about your ability to perform every day activities. Blood samples (about 1 teaspoons) for routine tests will be collected every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks. After that, blood samples (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected every 4 weeks. CT or MRI scan(s) will be performed every 12 weeks.\n\nIf a sample of your tumor tissue that was removed previously is available, it will be analyzed for expression of proteins that may effect tumor growth. However, if a sample is not available, you will not be asked to undergo a biopsy to collect this tissue. This sample may analyzed at any time during the study.\n\nIf you experience severe side effects, treatment may be delayed, stopped, or you may receive smaller doses of RAD001 and/or Octreotide Depot. You may continue to receive up to at least 12 courses of study treatment unless the disease gets worse, you decide not to take part any longer, or your doctor decides it is in your best interest to stop treatment. It may be possible to continue treatment beyond 12 courses if you are benefitting from this treatment.\n\nWhen you stop study treatment, you will be asked to have some tests and evaluations done. About 4 teaspoons of blood will be taken for routine lab tests, You will also have a physical exam and CT scan or MRI scan will be done to check the size and location of your disease.\n\nThis is an investigational study. RAD001 is investigational and is not commercially available. The drug combination in this study is also investigational. RAD001 is manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. About 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.",

      "brief_summary": "PRECISION-NEC is a single-center, open-label, pilot feasibility study of molecularly defined subtypes of metastatic high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (HG-NEC). The hypothesis is that HG-NEC (excluding small cell carcinoma) can be segregated based on mutational analysis and that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assignment of therapy is feasible and will potentially improve the outcomes.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nThere is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.\n\nLCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015 World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.\n\nLCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.\n\nBased on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).\n\nSimilarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.\n\nTreatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent, driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently defined a new subtype of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in large-cell carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example.\n\nTo date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapies for metastatic HG-NECs, based on mutational profiles. This study will utilize recent genomic profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of optimal treatments.",

AMG 479 is an antibody that is made in the laboratory. Antibodies are highly specific proteins produced by the body's immune system that recognize foreign substances in the body. AMG 479 has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that AMG 479 may help to prevent the growth of some neuroendocrine tumors. The observed antitumor activity of AMG 479, together with the current limited treatment options available for patients with neuroendocrine tumors, warrant further investigation of AMG 479 in this patient population.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of neoplasms. NETs are commonly subclassified into two broad subgroups according to their site of origin: pancreatic NETs are thought to arise from the endocrine cells of the pancreas, whereas NETs of other sites such as the lungs or gastrointestinal tract are often referred to as carcinoid tumors. While histologically similar, carcinoid tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have demonstrated different response rates in prior phase II studies of antitumor agents. Because of these differences, we will perform the current study using two cohorts of patients (30 with carcinoid and 30 with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors). The statistical design, however, is the same for both cohorts. With 30 patients in each cohort, this study has 80% power assuming type I error of 6% to differentiate a \\>/=17% objective response rate from a \\</=5% objective response rate using a single stage design.

Once the Primary End-Point was reached:\n\n   1. Participants who received more than 76 weeks of treatment/assessment, stopped the study treatment (however somatostatin analogues could be received as subsequent treatment as per Investigator's discretion) but continued the long-term follow-up assessment for 5 years overall from the date of randomization of the last participant randomized.\n   2.

      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "phase": "PHASE2",
      "condition": "Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor G1; Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor G2; Refractory Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Carcinoma",
      "intervention": "Sapanisertib",
      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well sapanisertib works in treating patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic), does not respond to treatment (refractory), or cannot be surgically removed. Drugs such as sapanisertib may stop the growth or shrink tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate overall response rate associated with sapanisertib (MLN0128 \\[TAK-228\\]) in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).\n\nSECONDARY ENDPOINTS:\n\nI. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) associated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).\n\nII. To measure the safety and tolerability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with advanced PNETs.\n\nIII. To evaluate disease control rate associated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with advanced PNETs.\n\nIV. To measure duration of response rate associated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with advanced PNETs.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly for 2 years.",

The study will enroll at least 8 patients in the GEP-NET cohort and as many adolescents with PPGL as possible in the exploratory PPGL cohort.",
      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consists of the screening period (up to 2 weeks) followed by the treatment period (4 treatment administrations at 8-week interval), and the follow-up period (10 years).\n\nThe treatment period will consist of 4 Lutathera treatments administered at 8-week intervals. Lutathera administration will occur on Week 1 Day 1 of each cycle. Each patient will receive a total of 4 doses of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi). An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with each Lutathera dose for renal protection according to the approved Lutathera local prescribing information. An antiemetic will be administered prior to infusion of the AA solution for prevention of infusion-related nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe dosimetry and PK assessments will be performed during the first week after the 1st Lutathera dose, i.e. one time during the study treatment period for each patient. The dosimetry analysis will allow for estimation from the 1st Lutathera administration of the cumulative absorbed radiation dose from 4 Lutathera doses and also for taking a decision on the next dose levels. In the exceptional circumstances when dosimetry cannot be performed in a particular patient after the first Lutathera dose, it should be completed as soon as feasible upon a later dose. In order to minimize risk for each study subject, an accelerated analysis of dosimetry and safety data will be performed for each patient in the study, to enable the Investigator to take a decision for the subsequent Lutathera doses. The results of dosimetry assessments (imaging and blood dosimetry) will be provided to the investigators for their evaluation prior to administration of subsequent therapeutic cycles in each patient.\n\nA total follow-up period of 10 years (120 months) after the last Lutathera dose will take place for each patient who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This follow-up period will be comprised of a short-term follow-up of 6 months to evaluate cumulative Lutathera toxicities, followed by a long-term follow up of another 114 months.\n\nAn external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also operate in the study to evaluate accumulating safety and dosimetry data, to ensure the safety of adolescents enrolled in the study, and to provide recommendations to investigators as well as to the clinical team in charge of conducting the study.",

Estimate the objective response rate (RR) of ziv-aflibercept among patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET)s according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n\nII. Test the following hypotheses: that baseline perfusion computed tomography (CT) parameters can predict which patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) will respond to treatment with ziv-aflibercept.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate progression free survival (PFS) duration among patients treated with ziv-aflibercept.\n\nII. Evaluate the relationship between response rate and baseline blood volume (BV) and between response rate and baseline permeability surface (PS).\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BV expressed as relative change from baseline correlate with response to ziv-aflibercept.\n\nII. Determine whether post-treatment tumor blood flow (BF) (absolute measurement) correlates with response to ziv-aflibercept.\n\nIII. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BF and, BV, expressed as relative change from baseline, correlate with relative change in sum of tumor diameters (RECIST 1.1 measurements).\n\nIV. Determine the effect of ziv-aflibercept therapy on post-treatment blood flow (BF), BV, mean transit time (MTT), and PS at 4 weeks after treatment.\n\nV. Evaluate the changes in tumor perfusion parameters at time of progression.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography perfusion imaging at baseline, day 21 of course 1, and at time of progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.",

      "detailed_description": "The Study Drugs:\n\nAvastin is designed to prevent the formation of new blood vessels that help cancer cells to grow. RAD001 is designed to block a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells.\n\nStudy Groups:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two treatment groups. During Cycle 1, one group will receive Avastin and the other group will receive RAD001. Each study cycle is 3 weeks long. In Cycle 2 and every cycle after that, participants in both groups will receive both study drugs. There is an equal chance of being assigned to either group.\n\nRAD001 Administration:\n\nRAD001 tablets are taken once a day by mouth, followed by a large glass of water. The tablets are in a blister-pack under aluminum foil. The blisters should only be opened at the time you take the study drug.\n\nYou may either take RAD001 on an empty stomach or after a low-fat meal. Some examples of low-fat meals include: cereal with fat-free milk, muffin or bagel with fat-free spread, or fruit salad. You should avoid taking RAD001 after large fatty meals because this will lower the amount of RAD001 your body absorbs. Your dietary habits around the time you take RAD001 should be as consistent as possible throughout the study.\n\nYou should take RAD001 at about the same time each day. The study staff will give you a medication diary that you should bring to every study visit. You will be asked to use the diary by writing down the date and time you take RAD001, how many tablets you take, and any side effects you may experience.\n\nAvastin Administration:\n\nAvastin is given through a needle in a vein in the arm. The first dose will be given over about 90 minutes. If no intolerable side effects occur, the second dose will be given over about 60 minutes, and if again no intolerable side effects occur, each dose after that will be given over about 30 minutes.\n\nOther Medications:\n\nIf you experience side effects from an Avastin infusion (such as fever/chills), you may receive additional medicine(s) at that time and before each later Avastin dose, in order to decrease the risk of side effects.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nOn Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive your assigned study drug.\n\nAt the beginning of Cycle 2 and every cycle after that, you will be asked about any side effects you are experiencing. You will have a complete physical exam performed, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will also be collected for routine tests.\n\nOn Day 8 of Cycles 1 and 2 only, about 2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn for routine tests. These blood draws may be done at a local lab closer to your home.\n\nEvery 9 weeks, to check the status of the disease, you will have either CT scans or MRI scans of the tumor(s). The scans will be the same type that you had performed during screening. You will also have additional blood drawn (about 1-2 tablespoons each time) to check any tumor markers that were found to be increased in your blood during the screening tests.\n\nIn order to learn about the flow of blood to the tumor, non-routine functional CT scans will be performed at the end of Cycles 1 and 3. When possible, these scans will be performed at the same times as the routine CT scans.\n\nLength of Study Treatment:\n\nYou may receive up to 12 cycles of study treatment, as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.\n\nThis is an investigational study. RAD001 is not commercially available or FDA approved for this type of cancer. Avastin is commercially available and FDA approved for the treatment of advanced cancer of the colon and rectum. At this time, this drug combination is being used for research only.\n\nUp to 36 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at The University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center.",

The only treatment for NETs is surgery, but most are found when they are too advanced for surgery. Researchers are looking for the best way to find NETs earlier, so that surgery can be successful. They want to test if the study drug can be used along with imaging devices to detect NETs.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To see how well a new experimental imaging agent, 68Gallium-DOTATATE, detects unknown primary and metastatic NETs in the gastrointestinal system and pancreas.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Adults over 10 years old with a suspected NET or family history of NET.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam, and have a blood test.\n* Participants will undergo three scans. For all of these, a substance is injected into their body, they lie on a table, and a machine takes images.\n* A standard computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\n* An octreotide scintigraphy Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT.\n* A 68Gallium-DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. The study drug is injected into a vein, usually in the arm. Low-dose X-rays go through the body. For about 40 minutes a large, donut-shaped device takes images of the body. The entire session takes 90 to 120 minutes.\n* Researchers will compare images from the three scans.\n* Participants will have 1 follow-up visit each year for 5 years. At this visit, they will have a medical exam, blood taken, and a CT scan.",

Furthermore, asymptomatic and symptomatic, sporadic and familial cases of NETs (such as Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), MEN1) will be included.\n* Demographic, clinical and pathologic data will be collected from the medical record and patient interview for each patient. Data will be stored in a computerized database.\n* After their initial on-study evaluation, patients will be staged according to findings on imaging studies with respect to primary tumor site, size and metastases. Surgical resection of NET and/or medical managements will be recommended based on standard practice guidelines. In patients who undergo surgical treatment, the samples will be immediately stored until molecular analysis.\n* Follow up will be done yearly for a total duration of 5 years.

      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may already be on Octreotide LAR.

Participants with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (e.g. celiac disease) are permitted to enroll.\n* Patient has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or on any other form of immunosuppressive medication. Adrenal replacement steroid disease are permitted in the absence of autoimmune disease.\n* The participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants with non-detectable viral loads on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cabozantinib and nivolumab.\n* The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluzone®) is allowed.\n* Pregnant or lactating females are excluded from this study because cabozantinib and nivolumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib and nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantinib and nivolumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n* Sexually active fertile subjects and their partners must agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier methods, including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and following treatment. Women of childbearing potential receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Contraception must be used for 4 months after last dose of cabozantinib.",

The purpose of the CRAD001K24133 study was to evaluate the safety profile of everolimus in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (pNETs) and to provide access of everolimus to this patient population. Everolimus was taken by participants until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, discontinuation from the trial for any other reason, or when it became commercially available for this indication, or until May 30, 2012, whichever came first. Prior to amendment 1, the study enrolled participants with NET of the lung (L-NETs) and gastrointestinal (GI) (GI-NETs) origin. The core study was stopped (per protocol) because everolimus was approved for pNETs. All ongoing patients with pNETs were switched to commercially available everolimus. For GI and lung NETs, everolimus was not approved at the time the core study was stopped. Therefore, patients with GI or lung NETs were not able to switch to commercial drug. To provide study medication access to these patients beyond 30 May 2012, the open label extension study, CRAD001K24133E1, was conducted. In the extension study, RAD001K24133E1, participants with GI or lung NETs who had not progressed during therapy with everolimus in the core study and who had not suffered from intolerable toxicity, were enrolled and treated with everolimus in order to provide data on long-term safety and efficacy. Patients were treated until it became commercially available in the respective indication or until documented tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity, any other reason or until study end on 31 May 2017, whichever came first.",

In patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), due to their heterogeneity and longer survival, it is expected that the prevalence of malnutrition is probably underdiagnosed, as well as the existence of a negative impact on different parameters (quality of life, survival). So far, the studies carried out on nutrition and NET are very scarce and none has been carried out so far in Spain.\n\nBefore being able to carry out nutritional intervention studies on these patients, it is necessary to know the reality of the nutritional status of patients with NETs in Spain. The main motivation for the NUTRIGETNE study is to evaluate the epidemiological status of nutrition in NETs in the spanish population. In addition to know the epidemiological picture, it is intended to study the nutritional status from different points of view: analytical, clinical, anthropometric, etc. Besides, the study of nutritional status will allow us to closely monitor the patients who have a higher risk of malnutrition and to propose early interventions for those, as well as the impact of their nutritional status on different parameters: survival, hospitalization, quality of life or responses to the treatments.\n\nNUTRIGETNE is a cross-sectional, open and multicenter study in which the nutritional status of patients with GEP NET in Spain will be evaluated.",

The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to assess the eligibility of the patient.

The duration of screening could be as short as one day but could not exceed 7 days. Patients who showed potassium level \\> 6.0 mmol/L (\\> 5.5 mmol/L for Poland only) at screening could have their potassium level corrected and could be re-screened afterwards.\n\nTreatment Phase:\n\nEligible patients were admitted to the in-clinic unit and dosed with arginine/lysine solution for infusion of 1,000 mL, which was administered intravenously over a period of 4 hours. Before the infusion (at 0 h time point), a set of baseline tests were performed. During and after the infusion, patient condition was monitored for evaluation of any adverse events. Only patients with a potassium level of ≤ 6 mmol/L at screening (\\> 5.5 mmol/L for Poland only) were allowed to be dosed. Potassium testing on the infusion day was performed at 0h (before the infusion), and at 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, and 24h after the start of infusion. Vital signs and ECGs were taken as specified in the assessment schedule. All patients were monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia, e.g. dyspnoea, weakness, numbness, chest pain and cardiac manifestations (conduction abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias). Other common adverse reactions during arginine/lysine solution administration are nausea and vomiting. Before the start of arginine/lysine solution infusion, an intravenous bolus of an anti-emetic was given. The choice of anti-emetic drugs was at the discretion of the physician.\n\nFollow-up Phase:\n\nAll patients were called for a safety follow-up in 48 hours after dosing.

      "brief_summary": "This phase III trial studies cabozantinib to see how well it works compared with placebo in treating patients with neuroendocrine or carcinoid tumors that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Cabozantinib is a chemotherapy drug known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and it targets specific tyrosine kinase receptors, that when blocked, may slow tumor growth.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether cabozantinib (cabozantinib S-malate) can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nIII. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).\n\nIV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors using CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE.\n\nV. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nVI. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nOTHER OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Results of the primary analysis will be examined for consistency, while taking into account the stratification factors and/or covariates of baseline quality of life (QOL) and fatigue.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare overall quality of life, disease-related symptoms, and other domains between the two treatment groups (cabozantinib versus \\[vs.\\] placebo) within each cohort of patients (pancreatic NET vs. carcinoid tumor). (Quality of Life Substudy Objective - A021602-HO1)\n\nPOPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To describe the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response relationships of cabozantinib in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors. (Population Pharmacokinetics Substudy Objective - A021602-PP1)\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and CT, MRI, and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study. Patients may crossover to receive cabozantinib S-malate at the time of disease progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks until disease progression or start of new anticancer therapy, and then every 6 months until 8 years after registration.",

The somatostatin receptor targeting of the therapeutic will be checked with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT imaging prior to therapy. Treatment consists of 3 cycles, 6-8 weeks apart. Cycle 1 dose is fixed with Cycles 2 and 3 doses to be determined by dosimetry-based calculation of renal doses from previous cycles not to exceed 23 Gy for the total renal dose.\n\nThe goals of this project are to\n\n1. Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of dosimetry-guided peptide receptor radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide in patients with neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.\n2. Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTATOC.\n3. Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) or 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT as an accurate technique for diagnosis, staging, treatment targeting, and monitoring response to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Disease not amenable to standard treatment (nonresectable or disease present after one or more surgeries and/or Sandostatin treatment) or subject has failed existing first line chemotherapy, biologic therapy, targeted agent therapy or radiation therapy.\n2. Participation in Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry.\n3. A pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) malignant neoplasm with at least one target lesion that is confirmed by conventional imaging and is determined to express somatostatin receptors by 68Ga-DOTATOC (TATE) PET within 6 months prior to treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC.\n4. The target lesion is one that either has never received external beam radiation or has been previously irradiated and has since demonstrated progression. Any local irradiation of the target lesion or any non-target lesions via external beam, conformal or stereotactic radiation treatments must have occurred more than 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Any full cranial-spinal radiation, whether or not a target lesion is included in the field, must have occurred more than 3 months prior to study drug administration.\n5. Life expectancy \\> 2 months at the time of study drug administration.\n6. Archival tissue from a previous biopsy will be required.\n7. Age ≥ 6 months-90 years at the time of study drug administration.\n8. Performance status as determined by Karnofsky ≥ 60 or Lansky Play Scale ≥ 60% at the time of study drug administration.\n9. Completion of Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire.\n10. Within 7-10 days of study drug administration, patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n    * absolute neutrophil count \\>1000/mm3\n    * Platelets \\>90,000/mm3\n    * total bilirubin \\<3X ULN for age\n    * AST(SGOT) \\& ALT(SGPT) \\<10X institutional upper limit of normal for age\n    * Urinalysis no greater than 1+ hematuria or proteinuria\n    * Renal function\\* Adults(age18 or \\>): Serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl; if serum creatinine is \\>1.2 mg/dL, nuclear GFR will be measured. GFR will need to be ≥ 80 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects ≤40 years old, ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects between 41-50; ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects between 51-60; ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects \\> 60 years old.\n\n    Children(age \\<18): nuclear GFR ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\n    \\* Renal function criteria based on our previous experience with 90Y-DOTATOC therapy and known changes in GFR with age13,21,33-35\n11. The effects of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 90Y-DOTATOC is a Class C agent with potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.\n2. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with 90Y-DOTATOC, breastfeeding should be discontinued until 6 weeks after the last administration of study drug.\n3. Surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n4. External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of \\<500 cGy to a single kidney or radiation to \\< 50% of a single kidney is acceptable).\n5. Prior PRRT with 90Y-DOTATOC (TATE) or 177Lu-DOTATOC (TATE) or 131I-MIBG therapy for this malignancy.\n6. Another investigational drug within 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n7. Concurrent, malignant disease for which patient is on active therapy.\n8. Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to complete this protocol.\n9. Any subject for whom, in the opinion of their physician, a 12-hour discontinuation of somatostatin analogue therapy represents a health risk. Also subjects who have received SandostatinLAR in the past 28 days or long-acting lanreotide within the past 8 weeks are excluded. Subjects may be maintained on short acting octreotide during the time from last injection of long-acting somatostatin analogue until 12 hrs prior to injection of study drug. Known antibodies to Octreotide, Lanreotide, or DOTATOC or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 90Y-DOTATOC.\n10. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) of study drug administration or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n11. Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n12. Subject weighs more than 450 pounds. (Subjects who weigh more than 450 pounds will not be able to fit inside the imaging machines.)\n13. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (due to cough, severe arthritis, etc.)",

For patients with progressive carcinoid tumors, progression-free survival (PFS defined by central review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] 1.1) will be compared between patients randomized to treatment with pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) versus placebo.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Overall survival (OS) will be compared between treatment arms. II. Objective response rate, duration of response, and time to treatment failure will be compared between treatment arms.\n\nIII. Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by central radiology review and local radiology review will be compared overall and within treatment arms.\n\nIV. Safety and tolerability of treatment with pazopanib/placebo will be evaluated within each treatment arm.\n\nV. PFS and other indicators of efficacy will be estimated in patients who crossover to pazopanib from placebo.\n\nVI. To determine the turn-around time for timely adjudicated central review. VII. To characterize the nature of discordance between local and central radiology review in assessment of progression.\n\nVIII. To characterize the type and rate of progression in carcinoid (at study entry, on-study, and at progression).\n\nIX. To develop new methods for modeling carcinoid growth and detecting treatment effects, and to perform simulations that advance new clinical trial designs to apply to future trials of carcinoid therapeutics.\n\nX. To assess for differences in quality of life (QOL)-related domains between the two treatment groups (pazopanib versus placebo).\n\nXI. To determine if the more brief measures of QOL-related domains provide comparable information to that which is provided by the longer assessments (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer \\[EORTC\\], neuroendocrine tumors \\[NET\\]21).\n\nXII. To provide validation data for the EORTC NET21 module in terms of responsiveness over time and differences across arms.\n\nXIII. To determine whether components of the plasma angiome panel that have been shown to be predictive previously (interleukin-6 \\[IL-6\\] and vascular endothelial growth factor \\[VEGF\\]-D) are predictive of a therapeutic advantage for pazopanib treatment in baseline samples from the patients treated on A021202.\n\nXIV. To determine whether other components of the plasma angiome panel tested (not IL-6 and VEGF-D) are predictive of a therapeutic advantage for pazopanib treatment in baseline samples from the patients treated on A021202.\n\nXV. To evaluate the changes in the plasma angiome markers after treatment with or without pazopanib over time.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. PFS at 6 months will be estimated within each treatment arm. II. Biochemical response (for chromogranin A, defined as a decrease of 50% or more in chromogranin A levels from baseline and for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid \\[5-HIAA\\], defined as a decrease of 50% or more in urinary 5-HIAA levels from baseline) will be compared between treatment arms among patients with elevated baseline levels of chromogranin A (CGA) and 5-HIAA.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) during screening. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and chest x-ray throughout the trial. Patients may optionally undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At the time of progressive disease, patients may cross-over to Arm I. Patients undergo ECHO or MUGA during screening. Patients also undergo CT, MRI, and chest x-ray throughout the trial. Patients may optionally undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 5 years.",
