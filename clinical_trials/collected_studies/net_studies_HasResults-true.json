      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",

Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and schedule.\n\nYou will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each cycle is 28 days.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle: questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).\n\nUrine tests will be performed every other cycle.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.\n\nAfter the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed: questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test, EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well berzosertib (M6620) works when given in combination with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) compared with topotecan alone in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has come back (relapsed), or small cell cancer that arises from a site other than the lung (extrapulmonary). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work by damaging the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in tumor cells, causing those cells to die and the tumor to shrink. However, some tumor cells can become less affected by chemotherapy because they have ways to repair the damaged DNA. The addition of M6620 could help topotecan hydrochloride shrink the cancer and prevent it from returning by blocking enzymes needed for DNA repair.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if the combination of berzosertib (M6620) with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) will result in an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to topotecan alone in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) with the combination of M6220 and topotecan in patients with relapsed SCLC and extrapulmonary small cell cancers.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI.

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis are not eligible due to their extremely poor prognosis and since it is unclear whether the investigational agent penetrates the blood-brain barrier. However, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days may be enrolled\n* Patients who have received prior topotecan therapy\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n  * Note: Patients who have had palliative radiotherapy may be included as long as they have recovered from any radiotherapy related adverse events (allow at least a week between radiotherapy completion and study treatment)\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy except hair loss and peripheral neuropathy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1)\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to M6620 or topotecan used in study\n* M6620 is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) should be avoided. Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or of which to minimize use. The Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card should be provided to patients. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 as a DDR inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620. These potential risks may also apply to topotecan used in this study\n* Patients with high grade neuroendocrine cancers, but with no small cell morphology will not be eligible\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome will not be eligible",

      "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of ramucirumab in advanced, progressive carcinoid tumors.\n\nCancer cells can make growth factors that cause the abnormal growth of new blood vessels. Ramucirumab is an investigational drug which works by blocking a receptor for a vascular growth factor, thereby preventing new blood vessels from forming. This may stop the cancer from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ramucirumab for treatment of Carcinoid Tumors.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed low- to intermediate-grade neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid tumor).\n* Carcinoid tumors of any site are eligible.

See Section 10 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n* Locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic disease.\n* Patients must have evidence of radiographic disease progression within the past 12 months. Progressive disease by RECIST criteria is not required.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status 0-1 (see Appendix A).\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/ mm3\n  * platelets ≥100,000/ mm3\n  * hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL\n  * total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit of normal, or ≤ 5× institutional upper limit of normal in the setting of liver metastases\n  * creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal\n  * urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (if urine dipstick or routine urinalysis is 2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate \\<1000 mg of protein in 24 hours)\n  * coagulation function Adequate coagulation function as defined by International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal. Patients on full-dose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose (minimum duration 14 days) of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin.\n  * The effects of ramucirumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because anti-antiangiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of Ramucirumab administration.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n* Patients who have undergone major surgery within 28 days or subcutaneous venous access device placement within 7 days prior to study enrollment.\n* Patients with elective or planned major surgery to be performed during the course of the clinical trial.\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients with any Grade 3-4 gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months prior to enrollment.\n* Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or any other significant thromboembolism (venous port or catheter thrombosis or superficial venous thrombosis are not considered \"significant\") during the 3 months prior to registration.\n* Patients who have experienced any arterial thromboembolic events, including but not limited to myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, or unstable angina, within 6 months prior to enrollment.\n* Patients with uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (\\>160 mmHg systolic or \\> 100 mmHg diastolic for \\>4 weeks) despite standard medical management.\n* Patients who have congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, clinically significant bradycardia, advanced heart block within the six months preceding enrollment.\n* Patients who have cirrhosis at a level of Child-Pugh B (or worse) or cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis.\n* Patients with a serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Patients receiving chronic antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and others), dipyridamole or clopidogrel, or similar agents. Once-daily aspirin use (maximum dose 325 mg/day) is permitted.\n* Patients with uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases.\n* Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or other adequately treated in situ cancer, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years.\n* Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis.\n* Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:\n\n  * Severely impaired lung function\n  * Any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infection/ disorders.\n  * Nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the treatment with the study therapy\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ramucirumab .\n* Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because ramucirumab is associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ramucirumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ramucirumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.",

The hypothesis is that HG-NEC (excluding small cell carcinoma) can be segregated based on mutational analysis and that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assignment of therapy is feasible and will potentially improve the outcomes.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nThere is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.\n\nLCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015 World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.\n\nLCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.\n\nBased on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).\n\nSimilarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.\n\nTreatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent, driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently defined a new subtype of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in large-cell carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example.\n\nTo date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapies for metastatic HG-NECs, based on mutational profiles. This study will utilize recent genomic profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of optimal treatments.",

In patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), due to their heterogeneity and longer survival, it is expected that the prevalence of malnutrition is probably underdiagnosed, as well as the existence of a negative impact on different parameters (quality of life, survival). So far, the studies carried out on nutrition and NET are very scarce and none has been carried out so far in Spain.\n\nBefore being able to carry out nutritional intervention studies on these patients, it is necessary to know the reality of the nutritional status of patients with NETs in Spain. The main motivation for the NUTRIGETNE study is to evaluate the epidemiological status of nutrition in NETs in the spanish population. In addition to know the epidemiological picture, it is intended to study the nutritional status from different points of view: analytical, clinical, anthropometric, etc. Besides, the study of nutritional status will allow us to closely monitor the patients who have a higher risk of malnutrition and to propose early interventions for those, as well as the impact of their nutritional status on different parameters: survival, hospitalization, quality of life or responses to the treatments.\n\nNUTRIGETNE is a cross-sectional, open and multicenter study in which the nutritional status of patients with GEP NET in Spain will be evaluated.",

To evaluate association of homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair deficiency (HRD) with the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib or olaparib monotherapy, as measured by rPFS, in mCRPC patients.\n\nIII. To evaluate the safety the combination of cediranib and olaparib and olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing in mCRPC patients and correlate that with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nII. To characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes, angiogenesis markers, and immune markers, by whole transcriptome sequencing and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIII. To characterize changes in immune tumor microenvironment in mCRPC patients by profiling expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIV. To identify baseline predictive biomarkers for rPFS or response and to identify on-treatment markers of acquired resistance in men with mCRPC receiving either olaparib plus cediranib or olaparib alone.\n\nV. To explore biomarker signatures that correlate with the clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib, including changes in gene expression or acquired mutations in tumor biopsies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.",

Patient has been permanently discontinued from pasireotide study treatment in the parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance to study procedures, withdrawal of consent or any other reason.\n2. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.\n3. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 30 days after the final dose of pasireotide s.c. and 84 days after the final dose of pasireotide LAR. Highly effective contraception is defined as either:\n\n   * Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n   * Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n   * Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to enrolling). For female patients on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n   * Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate \\<1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\n   * In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.\n   * Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.\n   * Sexually active males, unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 1 months after pasireotide s.c. last dose and 3 months after pasireotide LAR last dose, should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.",

The study will enroll at least 8 patients in the GEP-NET cohort and as many adolescents with PPGL as possible in the exploratory PPGL cohort.",
      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consists of the screening period (up to 2 weeks) followed by the treatment period (4 treatment administrations at 8-week interval), and the follow-up period (10 years).\n\nThe treatment period will consist of 4 Lutathera treatments administered at 8-week intervals. Lutathera administration will occur on Week 1 Day 1 of each cycle. Each patient will receive a total of 4 doses of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi). An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with each Lutathera dose for renal protection according to the approved Lutathera local prescribing information. An antiemetic will be administered prior to infusion of the AA solution for prevention of infusion-related nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe dosimetry and PK assessments will be performed during the first week after the 1st Lutathera dose, i.e. one time during the study treatment period for each patient. The dosimetry analysis will allow for estimation from the 1st Lutathera administration of the cumulative absorbed radiation dose from 4 Lutathera doses and also for taking a decision on the next dose levels. In the exceptional circumstances when dosimetry cannot be performed in a particular patient after the first Lutathera dose, it should be completed as soon as feasible upon a later dose. In order to minimize risk for each study subject, an accelerated analysis of dosimetry and safety data will be performed for each patient in the study, to enable the Investigator to take a decision for the subsequent Lutathera doses. The results of dosimetry assessments (imaging and blood dosimetry) will be provided to the investigators for their evaluation prior to administration of subsequent therapeutic cycles in each patient.\n\nA total follow-up period of 10 years (120 months) after the last Lutathera dose will take place for each patient who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This follow-up period will be comprised of a short-term follow-up of 6 months to evaluate cumulative Lutathera toxicities, followed by a long-term follow up of another 114 months.\n\nAn external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also operate in the study to evaluate accumulating safety and dosimetry data, to ensure the safety of adolescents enrolled in the study, and to provide recommendations to investigators as well as to the clinical team in charge of conducting the study.",

However sequential studies with pNETs are hard to be managed in terms of time and costs. Therefore the protocol was amended to have PFS1 (progression free survival after course 1) as primary endpoint and PFS2 (i.e. progression free survival after both STZ based chemotherapy and Everolimus or the reverse order) as secondary endpoint.
