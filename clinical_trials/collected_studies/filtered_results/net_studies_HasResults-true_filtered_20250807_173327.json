Every week, we will compile the top 5 stories in oncology, ranging from pivotal regulatory decisions to news updates and expert interviews spanning tumor types. Here’s what you may have missed this week: FDA Approves Perioperative Nivolumab for Resectable NSCLC On October 3, 2024, the FDA approved neoadjuvant nivolumab (Opdivo) plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant nivolumab monotherapy after surgery, for adults with resectable non–small cell lung cancer and no known EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements based on data from the phase 3 CheckMate-77T trial (NCT04025879). The median event-free survival was not reached (95% CI, 28.9-not estimable [NE]) in the nivolumab arm (n = 229) vs 18.4 months (95% CI, 13.6-28.1) in the chemotherapy arm (n = 232; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78; P = .00025). Locally Produced CAR T-Cell Therapy Elicits 92% ORR in R/R Multiple Myeloma Treatment with the academically sourced and produced, second-generation, BCMA-directed CAR T-cell therapy HBI0101 resulted in an objective response rate (ORR) of 92% in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (n = 84), according to updated data from a phase 1 trial (NCT04720313). Data, which were presented at the 21st International Myeloma Society Annual Meeting, indicated that the stringent complete response (CR)/CR rate was 55%, the very good partial response rate was 21%, the partial response rate was 16%, and the rate of progressive disease was 8%. FDA Grants Priority Review to Acalabrutinib in Treatment-Naive Mantle Cell Lymphoma The FDA has granted priority review to the supplemental new drug application seeking the approval of acalabrutinib (Calquence) for the treatment of patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma. The application is supported by data from the phase 3 ECHO trial (NCT02972840), which showed that at a median follow-up of 45 months, those who received acalabrutinib plus bendamustine and rituximab (Rituxan; BR; n = 299) experienced a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 66.4 months (95% CI, 55.1-NE) vs 49.6 months (95% CI, 36.0-64.1) for those given placebo plus BR (n = 299; HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.94; P = .0160). OncLive ’s September Roundup of Key FDA Approvals in Oncology This snapshot spotlights 8 key regulatory approvals that occurred in September 2024, including the anticipated decisions regarding adjuvant ribociclib (Kisqali) plus an aromatase inhibitor in hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative stage II and III early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence; isatuximab-irfc (Sarclisa) plus bortezomib (Velcade), lenalidomide (Revlimid), and dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not candidates for transplant; and amivantamab-vmjw (Rybrevant) plus chemotherapy for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R substitution mutations whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR inhibition. Revisit Every OncLive On Air Episode From September 2024 This recap spotlights the 9 total episodes of OncLive On Air that were released in September 2024. Among the top episodes were those of the FDA Approval Insights subseries, featuring insights from Jennifer Crombie, MD, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Allison Betof Warner, MD, PhD, who spoke to the approvals of epcoritimab-bysp (Epkinly) in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and afamitresgene autoleucel (Tecelra) in unresectable or metastatic synovial sarcoma, respectively; and an installment of How This Is Building Me , where host D. Ross Camidge, MD, PhD, sat down with Kadrin Wifong, MD, of PeerView Institute for Medical Education, to discuss the life events that led Wilfong to medical school and how she jumpstarted her career in oncology-focused education.",

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors have activity against a variety of tumor types. Carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor with a favorable safety profile that has been studied in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. Carfilzomib received accelerated approval from the U.S. FDA in 2012, based on a favorable response rate, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who received at least two prior therapies, and demonstrated disease progression within 60 days of completing the last therapy. In this multi-center study, the investigators propose to evaluate carfilzomib for the treatment of patients with advanced neuroendocrine cancers.",

Measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST v 1.1 criteria.\n3. Patients currently receiving or previously treated with single agent sandostatin LAR® are eligible. However, this is not a mandatory criterion to be included in the study.\n4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score of 0 or 1.\n5. Adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function.\n6. Predicted life expectancy \\> 12 weeks.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, adenocarcinoid, globlet cell carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, anaplastic carcinoid, pulmonary neuroendocrine and small cell carcinoma are not eligible.\n2. Patients who had radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, biologic therapy, investigational agents, or chemotherapy for cancer within 21 days or 5 half-lives of any chemotherapy or biologic/targeted agent, whichever is longer, prior to first treatment day of the study.\n3. Concurrent severe, intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment.\n4. Major surgical procedures ≤28 days of beginning study drug, or minor surgical procedures ≤7 days. No waiting required following port-a-cath placement.\n5. Previously untreated brain metastases. Patients who have received radiation or surgery for brain metastases are eligible if therapy was completed at least 2 weeks prior to study entry and there is no evidence of central nervous system disease progression, mild neurologic symptoms, and no requirement for chronic corticosteroid therapy.\n6.

      "detailed_description": "This is a Phase 2 peptide receptor radionuclide therapy trial of 90Y-DOTATOC in patients with somatostatin receptor positive tumors. The somatostatin receptor targeting of the therapeutic will be checked with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT imaging prior to therapy. Treatment consists of 3 cycles, 6-8 weeks apart. Cycle 1 dose is fixed with Cycles 2 and 3 doses to be determined by dosimetry-based calculation of renal doses from previous cycles not to exceed 23 Gy for the total renal dose.\n\nThe goals of this project are to\n\n1. Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of dosimetry-guided peptide receptor radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide in patients with neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.\n2. Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTATOC.\n3. Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) or 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT as an accurate technique for diagnosis, staging, treatment targeting, and monitoring response to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Disease not amenable to standard treatment (nonresectable or disease present after one or more surgeries and/or Sandostatin treatment) or subject has failed existing first line chemotherapy, biologic therapy, targeted agent therapy or radiation therapy.\n2. Participation in Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry.\n3. A pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) malignant neoplasm with at least one target lesion that is confirmed by conventional imaging and is determined to express somatostatin receptors by 68Ga-DOTATOC (TATE) PET within 6 months prior to treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC.\n4. The target lesion is one that either has never received external beam radiation or has been previously irradiated and has since demonstrated progression. Any local irradiation of the target lesion or any non-target lesions via external beam, conformal or stereotactic radiation treatments must have occurred more than 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Any full cranial-spinal radiation, whether or not a target lesion is included in the field, must have occurred more than 3 months prior to study drug administration.\n5. Life expectancy \\> 2 months at the time of study drug administration.\n6. Archival tissue from a previous biopsy will be required.\n7. Age ≥ 6 months-90 years at the time of study drug administration.\n8. Performance status as determined by Karnofsky ≥ 60 or Lansky Play Scale ≥ 60% at the time of study drug administration.\n9. Completion of Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire.\n10. Within 7-10 days of study drug administration, patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n    * absolute neutrophil count \\>1000/mm3\n    * Platelets \\>90,000/mm3\n    * total bilirubin \\<3X ULN for age\n    * AST(SGOT) \\& ALT(SGPT) \\<10X institutional upper limit of normal for age\n    * Urinalysis no greater than 1+ hematuria or proteinuria\n    * Renal function\\* Adults(age18 or \\>): Serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl; if serum creatinine is \\>1.2 mg/dL, nuclear GFR will be measured. GFR will need to be ≥ 80 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects ≤40 years old, ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects between 41-50; ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects between 51-60; ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects \\> 60 years old.\n\n    Children(age \\<18): nuclear GFR ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\n    \\* Renal function criteria based on our previous experience with 90Y-DOTATOC therapy and known changes in GFR with age13,21,33-35\n11. The effects of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 90Y-DOTATOC is a Class C agent with potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.\n2. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with 90Y-DOTATOC, breastfeeding should be discontinued until 6 weeks after the last administration of study drug.\n3. Surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n4. External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of \\<500 cGy to a single kidney or radiation to \\< 50% of a single kidney is acceptable).\n5. Prior PRRT with 90Y-DOTATOC (TATE) or 177Lu-DOTATOC (TATE) or 131I-MIBG therapy for this malignancy.\n6. Another investigational drug within 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n7. Concurrent, malignant disease for which patient is on active therapy.\n8. Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to complete this protocol.\n9. Any subject for whom, in the opinion of their physician, a 12-hour discontinuation of somatostatin analogue therapy represents a health risk. Also subjects who have received SandostatinLAR in the past 28 days or long-acting lanreotide within the past 8 weeks are excluded. Subjects may be maintained on short acting octreotide during the time from last injection of long-acting somatostatin analogue until 12 hrs prior to injection of study drug. Known antibodies to Octreotide, Lanreotide, or DOTATOC or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 90Y-DOTATOC.\n10. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) of study drug administration or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n11. Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n12. Subject weighs more than 450 pounds. (Subjects who weigh more than 450 pounds will not be able to fit inside the imaging machines.)\n13. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (due to cough, severe arthritis, etc.)",

Prior liver-directed or ablative treatment must be completed at least 28 days prior to registration.\n  * Prior radiation therapy: Radiation therapy must be completed per the following timelines\n\n    * i) Radiotherapy to the thoracic cavity or abdomen within 4 weeks prior to registration.\n    * ii) Radiotherapy to bone lesions within 2 weeks prior to registration.\n    * iii) Radiotherapy to any other site within 4 weeks prior to registration.\n    * NOTE: In all cases, there must be complete recovery and no ongoing complications from prior radiotherapy.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL\n  * platelets ≥100,000/mcL\n  * total bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (or 2.0 x ULN in patients with documented Gilbert's Syndrome)\n  * AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 × ULN or ≤ 3 × ULN for participants with documented liver metastases\n  * creatinine \\<1.5 × ULN Or creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min (using Cockcroft-Gault formula) for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n  * Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤ 1\n  * PT/INR or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test \\< 1.3 the laboratory ULN within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n* Negative urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.\n* Participant must be able to swallow pills.\n* The participant is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Major surgery (eg, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 8 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Complete wound healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month before first dose and from minor surgery (eg, simple excision, tooth extraction) at least 10 days before first dose. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants who have received a prior cabozantinib.\n* Participants who have received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti- PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)\n* Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.\n* The participant has tumor in contact with, invading, or encasing major blood vessels or radiographic evidence of significant cavitary pulmonary lesions.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cabozantinib or nivolumab.\n* Participants receiving any strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 within 14 days prior to registration are ineligible. Chronic treatment with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 is not allowed.\n* Cardiovascular disorders including:\n\n  * Congestive heart failure (CHF): New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III (moderate) or Class IV (severe) at the time of screening;\n  * Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) \\> 150 mm Hg systolic or \\> 100 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment;\n  * Any history of congenital long QT syndrome;\n  * QTcF interval \\>500 msec\n  * Any of the following within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment:\n\n    * unstable angina pectoris;\n    * clinically-significant cardiac arrhythmias;\n    * stroke (including transient ischemic attack (TIA), or other ischemic event);\n    * myocardial infarction;\n* GI disorders particularly those associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula formation including:\n\n  * Tumors invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer disease, active inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease), active diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis or acute obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric outlet obstruction\n  * Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months before screening\n* Thromboembolic events within 6 months of registration.\n\n  * Note: Low dose aspirin ≤ 81 mg/day is allowed. Anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of LMWH is allowed in patients who are on a stable dose of LMWH for at least 6 weeks prior to registration. Treatment with warfarin is not allowed.\n* The subject has experienced any significant bleeding episodes, including:\n\n  * Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment\n  * Clinically significant hemoptysis (\\> 0.5 teaspoon) within 3 months of the first dose of study treatment\n  * Any other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the start of study treatment\n  * Individuals with a history of different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.\n* Participant has an active infection requiring IV antibiotics\n* Any active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (e.g. celiac disease) are permitted to enroll.\n* Patient has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or on any other form of immunosuppressive medication. Adrenal replacement steroid disease are permitted in the absence of autoimmune disease.\n* The participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants with non-detectable viral loads on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cabozantinib and nivolumab.\n* The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluzone®) is allowed.\n* Pregnant or lactating females are excluded from this study because cabozantinib and nivolumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib and nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantinib and nivolumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n* Sexually active fertile subjects and their partners must agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier methods, including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and following treatment. Women of childbearing potential receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Contraception must be used for 4 months after last dose of cabozantinib.",

It was broadly classified into three groups based on the initial response to cisplatin/etoposide therapy, platinum-refractory, platinum-resistant, and platinum-sensitive, extensive stage SCLC inevitably relapses, at which point the only standard options are to rechallenge with the first-line chemotherapeutic regimen in the case of sensitive disease or to start the topoisomerase I inhibitor, topotecan. Sensitive disease is defined by a response to the first-line therapy and a treatment-free interval of at least 90 days, while the definitions of refractory and resistant disease, respectively, are nonresponse to the first-line treatment or relapse within 90 days. As an important predictor of response to the second-line treatment, the clinical cutoff of three months (or two months in some cases) for resistant and sensitive disease, which along with performance status prognostically separates patients into high- and low-risk categories, dictates subsequent management. This case report presents a resistant SCLC patient enrolled on a Phase II clinical trial called QUADRUPLE THREAT (formerly TRIPLE THREAT; NCT02489903 ) who responded to reintroduced platinum doublets after sequential priming with the resistance-reversing epi-immunotherapeutic agent, RRx-001. In the QUADRUPLE THREAT clinical trial, both during priming with RRx-001 and during sequential treatment with platinum doublets, the patient maintained a good quality of life and performance status.

One of these trials is designated TRIPLE THREAT ( NCT02489903 ), because it explores the conditioning or priming effect of RRx-001 on three tumor types - non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors - prior to re-administration of platinum doublets. In follow-up to a recent case study, which describes early monotherapeutic benefit with RRx-001 in a refractory EGFR-mutated NSCLC tumor, we present subsequent evidence of a radiological partial response to reintroduced platinum doublets after RRx-001. For the 50% of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who progress on EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (without evidence of a T790M mutations) as well as platinum doublets and pemetrexed/taxane, no other clinically established treatment options exist. A retrial of these therapies in EGFR-positive NSCLC patients via priming with epigenetic agents such as RRx-001 constitutes a strategy to 'episensitize' tumors (i.e. reverse resistance by epigenetic means) and to extend overall survival.

Platinum-taxane combination is the initial treatment of choice in ovarian cancer and the \"go-to regimen\" for patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive disease. However, platinum resistance is an inevitable and uniformly fatal development. One of the \"Holy Grails\" in ovarian cancer, besides early detection, is to reverse this resistance and retreat with a platinum doublet regimen. Because of the correlation between therapeutic resistance and poor clinical outcomes, this case, which potentially demonstrates a new avenue of anticancer development in epithelial ovarian cancer provided it is repeatable with other ovarian patients, was felt to merit a report.

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are grouped together as a single class on the basis of histologic appearance, immunoreactivity for the neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A and synaptophysin, and potential secretion of hormones, neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and neuropeptides. Nevertheless, despite these common characteristics, NETs differ widely in terms of their natural histories: high-grade NETs are clinically aggressive and, like small cell lung cancer, which they most closely resemble, tend to respond to cisplatin and etoposide. In contrast, low-grade NETs, which as a rule progress and behave indolently, do not. In either case, the treatment strategy, apart from potentially curative surgical resection, is very poorly defined. This report describes the case of a 28-year-old white male with a diagnosis of high-grade NET of undetermined primary site metastatic to the lymph nodes, skin and paraspinal soft tissues, treated with the experimental anticancer agent RRx-001, in the context of a phase II clinical trial called TRIPLE THREAT ( NCT02489903 ); serial sampling of tumor material through repeat biopsies demonstrated an intratumoral inflammatory response, including the amplification of infiltrating T cells, which correlated with clinical and symptomatic benefit. This case suggests that pseudoprogression or RRx-001-induced enlargement of tumor lesions, which has been previously described for several RRx-001-treated patients, is the result of tumoral lymphocyte infiltration.

This report presents the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian male with extensive-stage refractory SCLC who was restarted on platinum doublets as part of a clinical trial called TRIPLE THREAT ( NCT02489903 ) involving pretreatment with the epi-immunotherapeutic agent RRx-001, and who achieved a partial response after only 4 cycles. The patient had received a platinum drug twice before, in 2009 for a diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) and in 2015 for SCLC, suggesting that RRx-001 pretreatment may sensitize or resensitize refractory SCLC patients to first-line chemotherapy.

In general, the longer-lived the responses in first line, the better the outcome in second line, with the opposite prognosis for shorter-lived responses. Resistant SCLC is defined as relapse within 90 days of platinum-doublet treatment, and predictably correlates with shortened survival compared with sensitive disease, defined as relapse after 90 days. Case report: We present a patient with platinum-resistant SCLC that was rechallenged with cisplatin/etoposide in the context of the clinical trial TRIPLE THREAT ( NCT02489903 ) after treatment with, and progression on, the resistance-reversing anticancer agent RRx-001. Conclusion: The prolonged partial response of this platinum-resistant SCLC to reintroduced carboplatin/etoposide after RRx-001 belies and contradicts the prevailing orthodoxy in oncology that rechallenge with chemotherapy after the emergence of resistance is an exercise in futility and risk, which potentially exposes patients to toxicity without benefit. © 2016 S.

Methods: Patients were treated with RRx-001 4 mg IV on day 1 of each week of a 21-day cycle followed at progression by re-challenge with etoposide 80-100 IV mg/m 2 on days 1, 2 and 3 and cisplatin 60-80 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 or carboplatin AUC 5-6 IV on day 1, every 21 days. The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and overall response rate to platinum regimen. Results: Twenty-six patients were enroled and received at least one dose of RRx-001. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 (range 1-9) and 19 (73.1%) patients had platinum-resistant disease. In the intention-to-treat population, one patient (3.8%) had complete response and six (23.1%) had partial response on platinum plus etoposide. The estimated median and 12-month OS from enrolment were 8.6 months and 44.1%, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event from RRx-001 was mild discomfort at the infusion site (23%). Conclusions: RRx-001 followed by re-challenge with platinum plus etoposide chemotherapy is feasible and associated with promising results. Clinical trial registration: NCT02489903 .

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive lung tumor, characterized by a rapid doubling time and the development of widespread metastases, for which immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved to overcome T cell anergy. In light of its dismal prognosis, and lack of curative options, new therapies for extensive-disease SCLC are desperately needed. Methods: RRx-001 is a small molecule Myc inhibitor and down-regulates CD47 expression on tumor cells. We evaluated the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pre and post RRx-001 treatment in a phase 2 clinical trial, called QUADRUPLE THREAT, where patients with previously treated SCLC received RRx-001 in combination with a platinum doublet. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02489903 . Fourteen patients with SCLC were analyzed to investigate the association between clinical outcome and PD-L1 expression on CTCs pre and post RRx-001. The correlation between the binary clinical outcome (clinical benefit vs. progressive disease) and the change of PD-L1 expression on CTCs after RRx-001 was analyzed using a logistic regression adjusting for baseline PD-L1 expression. Results: The logistic model McFadden goodness of fit score was 0.477. The logistic model analyzing the association between decreased PD-L1 expression on CTCs after RRx-001 and response to reintroduced platinum doublet had an approximate 92.8% accuracy in its prediction of clinical benefit. The estimated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) displayed a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.99). Conclusions: These results suggest that PD-L1 expression on CTCs decreased after RRx-001 was significantly correlated with response to reintroduced platinum-based doublet therapy. Monitoring PD-L1 expression on CTCs during RRx-001 treatment may serve as a biomarker to predict response to RRx-001-based cancer therapy.

      "condition": "Carcinoid Tumor",
      "intervention": "Ziv-aflibercept",
      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and schedule.\n\nYou will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each cycle is 28 days.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle: questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).\n\nUrine tests will be performed every other cycle.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.\n\nAfter the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed: questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test, EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.",

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Objectives: Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are characterized by their expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This trial investigated the activity of Ziv-aflibercept, a recombinant protein that binds to and inhibits the activity of VEGF, in patients with advanced NETs ( NCT01782443 ). Methods: A single-arm, phase II trial enrolling patients with advanced, progressive extrapancreatic NET. Patients were treated with Ziv-aflibercept 4 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle; the starting dose was reduced to 2 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle because of hypertension-related events. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Results: The trial enrolled 19 patients (13 male:6 female). Patients received a median of 7 cycles (range, 1-18 cycles). The median progression free survival was 11.8 months (95% confidence interval, 3.2-16.1 months), and the median overall survival was 36.4 months (95% confidence interval, 16.1-not reached). Best responses by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 are as follows: 1 (5%) partial response, 13 (68%) stable disease, 2 (10%) with progressive disease, and 3 (15%) unevaluable. Hypertension occurred in 18 patients (95%), including grade 3-4 hypertension in 12 patients (63%). Conclusions: Although the progression free survival is similar to other VEGF inhibitors in NET, toxicity may preclude further investigation. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well berzosertib (M6620) works when given in combination with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) compared with topotecan alone in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has come back (relapsed), or small cell cancer that arises from a site other than the lung (extrapulmonary). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work by damaging the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in tumor cells, causing those cells to die and the tumor to shrink. However, some tumor cells can become less affected by chemotherapy because they have ways to repair the damaged DNA. The addition of M6620 could help topotecan hydrochloride shrink the cancer and prevent it from returning by blocking enzymes needed for DNA repair.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if the combination of berzosertib (M6620) with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) will result in an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to topotecan alone in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI.

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis are not eligible due to their extremely poor prognosis and since it is unclear whether the investigational agent penetrates the blood-brain barrier. However, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days may be enrolled\n* Patients who have received prior topotecan therapy\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n  * Note: Patients who have had palliative radiotherapy may be included as long as they have recovered from any radiotherapy related adverse events (allow at least a week between radiotherapy completion and study treatment)\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy except hair loss and peripheral neuropathy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1)\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to M6620 or topotecan used in study\n* M6620 is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) should be avoided. Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or of which to minimize use. The Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card should be provided to patients. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 as a DDR inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620. These potential risks may also apply to topotecan used in this study\n* Patients with high grade neuroendocrine cancers, but with no small cell morphology will not be eligible\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome will not be eligible",

A phase 2 study showed antitumor activity with the addition of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitor berzosertib to topotecan. Objective: To investigate whether the addition of berzosertib to topotecan improves clinical outcomes for patients with relapsed SCLC. Design, setting, and participants: Between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2022, this open-label phase 2 randomized clinical trial recruited 60 patients with SCLC and relapse after 1 or more prior therapies from 16 US cancer centers. Patients previously treated with topotecan were not eligible. Interventions: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone (group 1), 1.25 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 through 5, or with berzosertib (group 2), 210 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2 and 5, in 21-day cycles. Randomization was stratified by tumor sensitivity to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) in the overall population and among patients with platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant tumors. The PFS and OS for each treatment group were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare PFS and OS between the 2 groups, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the treatment hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Results: Of 60 patients (median [range] age, 59 [34-79] years; 33 [55%] male) included in this study, 20 were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone and 40 to receive a combination of topotecan with berzosertib. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 21.3 (18.1-28.3) months, there was no difference in PFS between the 2 groups (median, 3.0 [95% CI, 1.2-5.1] months for group 1 vs 3.9 [95% CI, 2.8-4.6] months for group 2; HR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.46-1.41]; P = .44). Overall survival was significantly longer with the combination therapy (5.4 [95% CI, 3.2-6.8] months vs 8.9 [95% CI, 4.8-11.4] months; HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.29-0.96], P = .03). Adverse event profiles were similar between the 2 groups (eg, grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, 11 of 20 [55%] vs 20 of 40 [50%], and any grade nausea, 9 of 20 [45%] vs 14 of 40 [35%]). Conclusions and relevance: In this randomized clinical trial, treatment with berzosertib plus topotecan did not improve PFS compared with topotecan therapy alone among patients with relapsed SCLC. However, the combination treatment significantly improved OS. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03896503 .

Evaluate the best overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (investigator-reported).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n1. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab-based therapy in this patient population.\n2. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in participants receiving pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.\n3. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in participants treated with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (median PFS and 18 wk PFS).\n4. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in participants receiving pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPart A: Participants are treated with pembrolizumab alone. An adaptive Simon's two-stage design was used, and the overall plan hinges on the activity of single agent pembrolizumab in the first stage of Part A. If there is sufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will expand to the second stage of Part A and forgo Part B. If there is insufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will proceed to the first stage of Part B (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy).\n\nPart B: Participants are treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (physician's choice, paclitaxel or irinotecan). Patients with stable disease (SD) or better after 9 cycles (27 weeks) of pembrolizumab-based therapy will have the option to continue with pembrolizumab alone, unless the first partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) is noted at 27 weeks.\n\nAll participants will undergo a pre-treatment tumor biopsy (unless the tumor is inaccessible and/or a biopsy is not felt to be in the participant's best interest). Participants may continue study treatment until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable adverse events, inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the participant, the participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, participant receives 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.\n2. Be at least 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.\n3. Have a histologically proven locally advanced or metastatic high grade (G3) poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC).\n\n   1. Includes small cell and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary or any extrapulmonary site (and poorly differentiated NEC, not otherwise specified)\n   2. Includes neuroendocrine prostate cancer (de novo or treatment-emergent) of prostate if small cell or large cell histology (histologic evidence of both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinoma may be present in same patient).\n   3. Other mixed tumors, e.g. mixed neuroendocrine neoplasms (MINENs) with NEC plus adenocarcinoma, squamous or acinar cell component are allowed if the high grade (small or large cell) NEC component comprises \\>50% of the original sample or subsequent biopsy.\n4. Have progressed during or after completion of first line systemic chemotherapy.\n\n   1. No limit to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens.\n   2. Early progression on/after adjuvant chemotherapy counts as firstline therapy.\n5. Have at least one measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.\n6. Patients must agree to have a biopsy of primary tumor or metastatic tissue at baseline, and there must be a lesion that can be biopsied with acceptable clinical risk (as judged by the investigator).\n\n   1. Patients with unsuccessful baseline biopsies may undergo an additional biopsy attempt (at the same or a different site, determined by the investigator).\n   2. For patients with an intact primary and no metastatic site that can be safely biopsied, biopsy of the primary is acceptable, but must be approved by the principal investigator.\n   3. Baseline tumor biopsy may be omitted if the tumor is inaccessible and/or a biopsy is not thought to post exceptionally high procedural risk due to location or other factors\n7.

The efficacy of CPI in combination with chemotherapy remains under investigation. Methods: Patients with advanced, progressive EP-PDNECs were enrolled in a two-part study of pembrolizumab-based therapy. In Part A, patients received pembrolizumab alone. In Part B, patients received pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. Primary endpoint: objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints: safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Tumours were profiled for programmed death-ligand 1 expression, microsatellite-high/mismatch repair deficient status, mutational burden (TMB), genomic correlates. Tumour growth rate was evaluated. Results: Part A (N = 14): ORR (pembrolizumab alone) 7% (95% CI, 0.2-33.9%), median PFS 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.7-21.4), median OS 7.8 months (95% CI, 3.1-not reached); 14% of patients (N = 2) had grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Part B (N = 22): ORR (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy) 5% (95% CI, 0-22.8%), median PFS 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.4), median OS 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.1-8.2); 45% of patients (N = 10) had grade 3/4 TRAEs. The two patients with objective response had high-TMB tumours. Discussion: Treatment with pembrolizumab alone and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was ineffective in advanced, progressive EP-PDNECs.

Telotristat etiprate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Studying the changes within the tumor cells via AMT-PET may help doctors better understand how tumors respond to treatment with telotristat etiprate.",

To evaluate the effect of telotristat etiprate (telotristat ethyl) treatment in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) using carbon C 11 alpha-methyltryptophan (alpha-\\[11C\\]methyl-?L-?tryptophan) (AMT)-?positron emission tomography (PET) as measured by changes in tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Show that NETs will have increased AMT uptake on PET, as compared to surrounding non-tumor tissue at baseline.\n\nII. Use compartmental modeling (in tumors with the left ventricle of the heart in the field-of-view) to measure change in AMT retention.\n\nIII. Measure change in AMT retention as mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants undergo AMT-PET within 7 days prior to, and 9-14 days after start of telotristat etiprate treatment. Participants receive telotristat etiprate orally (PO) three times a day (TID) for 9-14 days.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 3 months.",

The trial utilized a step-up dosing strategy for obrixtamig to mitigate immune-mediated toxicities. The study enrolled patients who progressed after 1 or more lines of platinum-based treatment with or without a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. Three dose levels of obrixtamig were evaluated in the study. Interim results showed an encouraging overall response rate (ORR) of 70% (95% CI, 47%-87%), with responses maintained at 69% (95% CI, 39%-91%) among the 13 patients who underwent confirmatory imaging. Wermke noted that these early findings may suggest synergistic activity between obrixtamig and topotecan, warranting further exploration. Wermke noted that safety outcomes were consistent with expectations based on the known toxicity profiles of each agent alone. Topotecan-associated cytopenias were reported, including neutropenia (68%) and thrombocytopenia (92%), though no associated infectious or bleeding complications occurred. Obrixtamig-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 48% of patients; these were mostly grade 1 effects (44%), with a few grade 2 cases (4%). No grade 3 or higher CRS was observed. Additionally, neurotoxicity including immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome was rare, with only two patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 muscle spasms.",

The efficacy of cabozantinib in the treatment of previously treated, progressive extrapancreatic or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is unclear. Methods: We enrolled two independent cohorts of patients - those with extrapancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and those with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors - who had received peptide receptor radionuclide therapy or targeted therapy or both. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib at a dose of 60 mg daily or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review. Key secondary end points included objective response, overall survival, and safety. Results: In the cohort of 203 patients with extrapancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, the median progression-free survival with cabozantinib was 8.4 months, as compared with 3.9 months with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.59; P<0.001). In the cohort of 95 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, the median progression-free survival with cabozantinib was 13.8 months, as compared with 4.4 months with placebo (stratified hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.42; P<0.001). The incidence of confirmed objective response with cabozantinib was 5% and 19% among patients with extrapancreatic and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, respectively, as compared with 0% with placebo. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were noted in 62 to 65% of the patients treated with cabozantinib, as compared with 23 to 27% of the patients who received placebo. Common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher included hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, and thromboembolic events. Conclusions: Cabozantinib, as compared with placebo, significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with previously treated, progressive advanced extrapancreatic or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of cabozantinib. (Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others; CABINET ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03375320 .).

                "full_content": "Jennifer Chan, MD, MPH Interim data from the phase 3 CABINET trial (NCT03375320) demonstrated significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with cabozantinib (Cabometyx) vs placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic or extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) following progression on prior systemic therapy. As such, the trial will be unblinded and discontinued following a unanimous decision from the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. 1 Adverse effects that occurred with cabozantinib in the trial were consistent with its known safety profile, and no new signals were reported. Detailed findings from the trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and discussed with the FDA. “As there is no standard of care for patients with advanced pancreatic or extrapancreatic neuroendocrine tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy, we are pleased to see that cabozantinib improved outcomes for two additional patient populations living with advanced, difficult-to-treat cancers,” Will Berg, MD, senior vice president, Medical Affairs, Exelixis, stated in a news release. “We are grateful for the recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to unblind the CABINET study early due to a dramatic improvement in efficacy and look forward to discussing these findings with the US Food and Drug Administration.” CABINET is a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, pivotal phase 3 trial that enrolled 290 patients into 2 cohorts of patients with pancreatic NETs (n = 93) and extrapancreatic NETs (n = 197) in the United States. To be eligible for enrollment, patients must have well or moderately differentiated, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic or extra-pancreatic NETs by local pathology, 2 measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 criteria, and disease progression in the 12 months prior to enrollment after at least one FDA-approved line of therapy other than somatostatin analogs. Prior therapy must have included either everolimus (Afinitor), sunitinib (Sutent), or lutetium Lu 177 dotatate ( 177 Lu dotatate; Lutathera) in patients with pancreatic NETs; everolimus in patients with lung NETs; and everolimus or 177 Lu dotatate in patients with gastrointestinal NETs. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive oral cabozantinib once daily or placebo in 28-day cycles in each of the 2 cohorts. 2 In addition to the primary end point of PFS in each cohort, secondary end points included overall survival, radiographic response rate, and safety. Following documentation of disease progression, patients were unblinded, and those receiving placebo were allowed to cross over to open-label therapy with cabozantinib. 1 “Patients with progressive neuroendocrine tumors have limited treatment options. At present, after progression on previous therapies, the treatment path is unclear, underscoring the need for additional options for this disease that is rising in incidence,” Jennifer Chan, MD, MPH, study chair for the CABINET trial and clinical director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center and director of the Program in Carcinoid and Neuroendocrine Tumors at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, stated in the release. “These promising findings from the CABINET trial, in which cabozantinib showed an efficacy benefit for patients with pancreatic and extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, are welcome news and show the potential for cabozantinib to address important unmet needs for this community.” References Exelixis announces positive results from phase 3 CABINET pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in advanced pancreatic and extra-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.

                "full_content": "Jennifer A. Chan, MD, MPH Patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NET) who experienced progression following prior therapy experienced a significant improvement in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) after treatment with cabozantinib (Cabometyx) compared with placebo, according to findings from the phase 3 CABINET trial (NCT03375320) presented during the 2023 ESMO Congress . At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, patients with extra-pancreatic NETs (epNETs) who received the TKI (n = 129) experienced a median PFS of 8.3 months vs 3.2 months with placebo (n = 68; stratified HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30-0.66; P < .0001). Additionally, at a median follow-up of 16.7 months, patients with pancreatic NETs (pNETs) achieved a median PFS of 11.4 months vs 3.0 months in the cabozantinib (n = 62) and placebo (n = 31) arms, respectively (stratified HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.49; P < .0001). “There’s an unmet need for new treatment options for patients with advanced NETs,” Jennifer A. Chan, MD, MPH, clinical director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center and director of the Program in Carcinoid and Neuroendocrine Tumors at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, said during the presentation. “Multiple studies have shown that VEGF pathway inhibitors are active against NETs.” CABINET enrolled patients with well- to moderately-differentiated, grade 1 to 3 NETs. Patients needed to have disease progression (PD) according to RECIST criteria within 12 months prior to random assignment and have PD after or intolerance of at least 1 prior FDA-approved systemic therapy, excluding somatostatin analogs. Concurrent use of somatostatin analogs was permitted if administered at a stable dose for at least 2 months. Patients in both the epNETs and pNETs subgroups were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either cabozantinib at 60 mg daily or daily placebo until PD. Patients in the placebo arm were allowed to crossover and receive cabozantinib 60 mg daily after PD. The primary end point was PFS by blinded independent central review, and secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, safety, and tolerability. In the epNETs group, at baseline, patients in the cabozantinib and placebo arms had a median age of 66 years (range, 28-86) vs 66 years (range, 30-82), respectively. Most patients in both arms had an ECOG performance status of 1 (64% vs 52%), well-differentiated disease (79% vs 84%), grade 2 disease (63% vs 66%), and received concurrent treatment with somatostatin analogs (62% vs 65%). The median number of prior lines of therapy received was 2 (range, 1-7) vs 2 (range, 1-6), respectively, and the median time from diagnosis to random assignment was 87 months (range, 10-489) vs 83 months (range, 13-340). Similarly, in the pNETs group, patients in the cabozantinib and placebo arms had a median age of 60 years (range, 29-79) vs 64 years (range, 39-79), respectively. Most patients in both arms were men (56% vs 58%), had well-differentiated disease (90% vs 97%), had grade 2 disease (63% vs 63%), and received prior treatment with somatostatin analogs (97% vs 94%). The median number of prior lines of therapy received was 3 (range, 1-9) vs 2 (range, 0-7), respectively, and the median time from diagnosis to random assignment was 84 months (range, 1-213) vs 83 months (range, 18-197). In the epNETs cohort, patients in the cabozantinib and placebo arms underwent a median number of 5 (range, 0-35) and 3 (range, 0-24) cycles of therapy, respectively. At the data cutoff, 22% and 16% remained on treatment, respectively. Reasons for treatment discontinuation included PD (36% vs 50%), adverse effects (AEs; 20% vs 15%), consent withdrawal (9% vs 4%), alternate therapy (3% vs 1%), physician decision (2% vs 6%) and death (5% vs 3%). In the pNETs cohort, patients in the cabozantinib and placebo arms underwent a median number of 7 (range, 0-38) and 4 (range, 0-12) cycles of therapy, respectively. At the data cutoff, 24% and 13% of patients remained on treatment, respectively. Reasons for treatment discontinuation included PD (35% vs 71%), AEs (16% vs 0%), consent withdrawal (5% vs 10%), and intercurrent illness (5% vs 3%). Additional data from the study revealed that the median OS in the epNETs cohort was 21.9 months vs 22.4 months in the cabozantinib and placebo arms, respectively (stratified HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.56-1.46; log-rank P = .34). In the pNETs cohort, the median OS was 43.5 months vs 31.0 months in the cabozantinib and placebo arms, respectively (stratified HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.34-1.73; log-rank P = .26). In terms of safety, patients in the cabozantinib (n = 124) and placebo (n = 63) arms of the epNETs cohort experienced grade 3 (59.7% vs 33.3% respectively), grade 4 (7.3% vs 1.6%), and grade 5 (8.9% vs 7.9%) AEs. Commonly occurring grade 3 or higher AEs consisted of hypertension (27.4% vs 4.8%), fatigue (13.7% vs 7.9%), and diarrhea (10% vs 3%). Investigators noted that of the 11 grade 5 AEs that were observed in the cabozantinib arm, events were unrelated or unlikely to be related to treatment in 8 patients and possibly related in 3 patients. In the pNETs cohort, patients in the cabozantinib arm (n = 60) experienced grade 3 (56.7%), grade 4 (8.3%), and grade 5 (3.3%) AEs; those in the placebo arm (n = 30) experienced grade 3 AEs (43.3%). The most common grade 3 or higher AEs included hypertension (26.7% vs 20.0% respectively), fatigue (13.3% vs 3.3%), and hyperglycemia (8.3% vs 10.0%). The grade 5 AEs in the cabozantinib arm were determined to be unrelated to treatment. “The interim analyses and both of the cohorts showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful difference in PFS in patients treated with cabozantinib,” Chan concluded. “Based on these results, the DSMB voted unanimously to stop accrual to the trial, unblind all patients, and all those receiving placebo to crossover to cabozantinib. The AEs that we observed were consistent with the known safety profile of cabozantinib. Based on these results, cabozantinib may become a new treatment option for patients with previously treated, progressive NETs.” Reference Chan J, Geyer S, Ou FS, et al.

The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of ramucirumab in advanced, progressive carcinoid tumors.\n\nCancer cells can make growth factors that cause the abnormal growth of new blood vessels. Ramucirumab is an investigational drug which works by blocking a receptor for a vascular growth factor, thereby preventing new blood vessels from forming. This may stop the cancer from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ramucirumab for treatment of Carcinoid Tumors.",

Once-daily aspirin use (maximum dose 325 mg/day) is permitted.\n* Patients with uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases.\n* Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or other adequately treated in situ cancer, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years.\n* Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis.\n* Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:\n\n  * Severely impaired lung function\n  * Any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infection/ disorders.\n  * Nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the treatment with the study therapy\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ramucirumab .\n* Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because ramucirumab is associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ramucirumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ramucirumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.",

This trial investigated the activity of ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and inhibits activity of VEGF, in combination with somatostatin analog therapy in patients (pts) with advanced extra-pancreatic NET. Methods: We conducted a single-arm phase II trial enrolling pts with advanced, progressive extra-pancreatic NET. Patients were treated with ramucirumab 8 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints toxicity, radiographic and biochemical tumor response rate, and overall survival (OS). Results: The trial enrolled 43 patients. Primary tumor sites included small intestine 20 (46%), lung 10 (23%), thymus 3 (7%), rectum 1(2%), kidney 1(2%), and unknown primary 8(18%). Median PFS was 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.0-25.6 months), and median OS was 24.9 months (95% CI, 20.7-43.1 months). Best response by RECIST 1.1: partial response 5% (95% CI, 0.6%-15.8%). Chromogranin A levels dropped by at least 50% in 10% of the 37 patients who had elevated levels at baseline. Most common all-grade adverse events included fatigue (84%) and hypertension (84%). Conclusion: Ramucirumab demonstrated efficacy and safety in this single-arm phase II trial. These findings support the continued evaluation of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of NET.

Pre-clinical data demonstrates a potential synergistic role for cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibition and everolimus to treat this disease. In this phase II multicenter study, patients with advanced foregut WDNETs received combination ribociclib and everolimus until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The first 12 patients received ribociclib 300 mg three weeks in a row with a 1 week break and everolimus 2.5 mg daily (recommended phase II dose). Due to unexpected hematologic and infectious toxicities, the trial was put on hold, modified, and an additional 9 patients received ribociclib 200 mg and everolimus 2.5 mg daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Archived pre-treatment tumor was profiled by next-generation sequencing to evaluate for genomic markers of drug response. Twenty-one patients were treated (median age, 56; range, 24 to 77). The study did not meet the pre-specified criteria to advance to stage two. No patients experienced an objective response. Thirteen patients (62%) experienced stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months (95% CI, 2.8 months to not reached). Eleven of the first 12 patients (92%) developed grade 2 or more myelosuppression. Ten patients (84%) experienced treatment interruption and 8 patients (67%) required dose reduction. Genetic testing in archival tumor tissue samples failed to identify a predictive biomarker of disease stabilization. The combination of ribociclib and everolimus had insufficient activity to warrant further investigation in foregut WDNETs. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03070301 .

The (over) expression of some of these factors has been linked to poor prognosis. Cabozaninib, a VEGF inhibitor, in combination with atezolizumab, an inhibitor of PD-L1, may be active in endocrine tumors by overcoming the resistance to prior antiangiogenic drugs.\n\nThe trial will include patients with advanced and refractory tumors of endocrine system and patients would be allocated to six different cohorts according to the following tumor types.",

Secondary objectives include:\n\n* To evaluate the safety profile of cabozantinib and atezolizumab combination, according to NCI-CTCAE V5.0.\n* Duration of response (DoR) as per RECIST V1.1.\n* Progression-free survival (PFS): median PFS as per RECIST V1.1.\n* Overall Survival (OS): median OS as per RECIST V1.1.\n* Tumor biomarkers: translational sub-study (optional).\n\nTreatment:\n\nAll the subjects will be treated with the combination until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient consent withdrawal (whichever occurs first):\n\n* Cabozantinib 40 mg or 20 mg tablets, oral administration once daily continuously.\n* Atezolizumab 1200 mg administered intravenously (IV) every three weeks (cycle).\n\nRationale:\n\nEndocrine tumors from different origins (thyroid, lung, pancreas and digestive tract, adrenal gland and paraganglia) are characterized by being remarkably vascular and expressing several growth factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-α and -β. The (over) expression of some of these factors has been linked to poor prognosis. Cabozaninib, a VEGF inhibitor, in combination with atezolizumab, an inhibitor of PD-L1, may be active in endocrine tumors by overcoming the resistance to prior antiangiogenic drugs.\n\nPatients allocation:\n\nThe trial will include patients with advanced and refractory tumors of endocrine system and patients would be allocated to six different cohorts according to the following tumor types:\n\nCohort 1: Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of the lung and thymus (grades 1 and 2) after progression to somatostatin analogs, targeted agents, PRRT, and/or chemotherapy.\n\nCohort 2: Anaplastic thyroid cancer in first-line or after progression to chemotherapy or investigational drugs.\n\nCohort 3: Adrenocortical carcinoma after progression to chemotherapy and/or mitotane.\n\nCohort 4: Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma after progression to peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) if indicated, prior chemotherapy and biological therapy, such as somatostatin analogs, are allowed.\n\nCohort 5: Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors of digestive system after progression to somatostatin analogs, targeted agents, PRRT, and/or chemotherapy.\n\nCohort 6: Grade 3 neuroendocrine neoplasm of any origin, excluding small cell lung cancer, after progression to chemotherapy or targeted agents/PRRT.",

The hypothesis is that HG-NEC (excluding small cell carcinoma) can be segregated based on mutational analysis and that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assignment of therapy is feasible and will potentially improve the outcomes.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nThere is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.\n\nLCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015 World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.\n\nLCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.\n\nBased on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).\n\nSimilarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.\n\nTreatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent, driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently defined a new subtype of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in large-cell carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example.\n\nTo date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapies for metastatic HG-NECs, based on mutational profiles. This study will utilize recent genomic profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of optimal treatments.",

Due to its rarity there is a lacuna in our understanding of LCNEC's molecular biology. In 2016, Rekhtman and colleagues presented one of the largest molecular sequencing series of pulmonary LCNEC. They differentiated genomic profiles of LCNEC into two major subsets: small cell lung cancer (SCLC)-like, characterized by TP53 + RB1 co-mutation/loss, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-like, characterized by the lack of co-altered TP53 + RB1. This finding is of significance because at present LCNEC patients are often treated like SCLC. However, the universal genomic SCLC biomarker of TP53 and RB1 co-mutation was only found in 40% of their cohort. Since then various other scientists have looked into molecular profiling of LCNEC with markedly discordant results. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of publicly available next generation sequencing (NGS) data to evaluate the prevalence of TP53 + RB1 co-mutation in LCNEC. Method: We conducted a literature search using PubMed. Seven studies including 302 patients with pulmonary LCNEC and four studies including 20 patients with extra-pulmonary LCNEC underwent final analysis. Results: The prevalence of TP53 + RB1 co-mutation was 36% (109/302) among pulmonary LCNEC patients and 35% (7/20) among the extra-thoracic LCNEC cohort. This finding is in stark contrast to >90% TP53 + RB1 co-mutation in SCLC. Conclusion: It is now well established that LCNEC is molecularly distinct from SCLC. LCNEC seems to have two molecularly defined sub-cohort based on TP53 + RB1 co-mutation status. Future studies should look into prognostic and predictive implication of TP53 + RB1 co-mutation status in LCNEC. Prospective studies should be designed to characterize molecular subtypes and direct treatment accordingly. We are currently conducting a prospective pilot clinical trial wherein LCNEC patients are treated based on TP53 + RB1 co-mutation status. The study is currently enrolling. \"Next Generation Sequencing-Based Stratification of Front Line Treatment of Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (PRECISION-NEC).

Tawbi, MD, PhD The combination of the anti–LAG-3 agent relatlimab plus the PD-1 agent nivolumab (Opdivo) resulted in a superior progression-free survival (PFS) benefit over nivolumab alone, and the efficacy achieved with the doublet did not come at the cost of increased toxicity, according to Hussein A. Tawbi, MD, PhD, who added that these data underscore the potential for this regimen to become a new standard of care if approved. Primary results from thephase 3 RELATIVITY-047 (CA224-047) trial (NCT03470922) were presented during the 2021 ASCO Annual Meeting and showed that the median PFS of relatlimab/nivolumab per blinded independent central review was nearly double that observed with nivolumab monotherapy, at 10.12 months (95% CI, 6.37-15.74) vs 4.63 months (95% CI, 3.38-5.62), respectively (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.92; P = .0055). 1 Additional data presented during the 2021 ESMO Congress showed that the addition of relatlimab to nivolumab resulted in prolonged benefit beyond initial treatment and first progression and reduced the risk of progression or death after the next line of systemic therapy vs nivolumab alone.2 In September 2021, the FDA granted a priority review to a biologics license application for the fixed-dose combination for use in the treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older and weighing at least 40 kg who have unresectable or metastatic melanoma based on data from RELATIVITY-047.3 “We now have additional evidence that dual checkpoint inhibitor combinations are appropriate and a good strategy to pursue. We have a novel checkpoint inhibitor, an anti–LAG-3, that seems to be able to give us additional improvement in clinical activity [in patients with melanoma],” Tawbi said. “We [may soon] have a new combination added to our armamentarium for the first-line treatment of melanoma [and we can] potentially [consider this to be a] new standard of care in the coming months or years. [It is exciting] that we can give [this option] to our patients without the added [cost of toxicity].” In an interview with OncLive ® , Tawbi, professor and deputy chair of the Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology in the Division of Cancer Medicine; director of Melanoma Clinical Research and Early Drug Development; and director of Personalized Cancer Therapy in the Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology of the Division of Cancer Medicine, at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, discusses the safety and efficacy achieved with relatlimab plus nivolumab in the RELATIVITY-047 trial and sheds light on the clinical significance of the data in the melanoma treatment paradigm. OncLive ® : What was the rationale for the RELATIVITY-047 trial? Tawbi: Anti–PD-1 antibodies have changed the way that we treat patients with cancer. In melanoma specifically, we have been very lucky to have single-agent anti–PD-1 [agents] showing clinical activity. We also have single-agent anti–CTLA-4 [agents] showing independent clinical activity. We know that the combination of CTLA-4 and PD-1 is very effective and improves overall survival [OS] in patients with melanoma. That was the first dual checkpoint inhibitor combination to lead to improved OS and to gain FDA approval. We use it widely, especially in patients with brain metastases, and in other settings. The challenge with this combination has consistently been the fact that it also has significant toxicity, with up to 55% of grade 3 or 4 adverse effects [AEs]. We have been, as a field, working for a significant amount of time to identify novel targets and combinations that could either compare with dual checkpoint inhibition with CTLA-4 and PD-1, or improve upon it, but most importantly, help with decreasing the rate of toxicity. Anti–LAG-3 antibodies have emerged as 1 of several checkpoint inhibitors that have been in clinical trials that are trying to improve upon single-agent PD-1. The fact that LAG-3 is co-expressed with PD-1 on exhausted T cells made for a very good scientific rationale to try to inhibit LAG-3, just like we inhibit PD-1 and CTLA-4. [Additionally], preclinical models have shown excellent synergy with anti–PD-1 inhibition. This phase 3 trial was built on safety results from a phase 1 trial that showed that this dose is safe and has clinical activity, and then this randomized phase 2/3 trial was conducted to assess the potential improvement in PFS, and eventually in OS, over single-agent anti–PD-1. The rationale was strong, scientifically, and there was enough clinical data to warrant a phase 3 trial. The phase 3 trial was conducted globally; it [enrolled] 714 patients who were accrued from several continents. When we saw the data come out from the first analysis [of the trial], we were very pleased to see that it met its primary end point of improvement in PFS [achieved with] nivolumab and relatlimab given as a fixed-dose combination. Could you expand on the design of the trial? What were the results reported from the initial analysis of the trial? The study was designed as a seamless phase 2/3 trial, and [randomized patients] 1:1 to receive either nivolumab plus relatlimab or single-agent nivolumab. It was stratified by important factors, such as PD-L1 expression, LAG-3 expression, BRAF [mutational status], and [disease] stage. The first component of the study included approximately 400 patients who were randomized to the phase 2 [portion], and then the enrollment stopped as planned for an interim analysis after 6 months. The statistical design allowed for an independent data monitoring committee to analyze the PFS data and decide whether the study hit an interim efficacy end point that allowed it to proceed to phase 3. At the first analysis, the study reached that efficacy end point, and this allowed us to open the study to the phase 3 accrual, at which point more than 300 patients were added. The entire cohort [was then analyzed together]. This was an event-driven analysis, and the first analysis was conducted after the expected number of events had happened. Again, the study’s primary end point was met, with an improvement in PFS over single-agent PD-1. [Results showed that] the median PFS was 10.1 months [with the combination] vs 4.6 for single-agent nivolumab. However, we really focused on comparing the hazard ratios [HRs], which is important. The HR was 0.75 with a very significant P value of .0055. That tells us that if we treat patients with nivolumab and relatlimab, the risk of progression is decreased by 25% compared with nivolumab alone. The other result that is remarkable is the 1-year landmark. At the 1-year landmark, the PFS rate was 47.7% [with the doublet] compared with 36.0% for single-agent PD-1. Therefore, the benefit is not just early, but is also consistent until the 1-year mark. What should be taken away regarding the safety profile of the combination? That is the one of the most remarkable aspects of this combination. In oncology, we are used to the fact that if we want to give a patient more benefit, that must come at the cost of more toxicity. As such, there is the expectation that if you treat with a combination, [patients] may experience more immune-related AEs. In the phase 3 trial, the observed immune-related AEs in the combination arm were higher than the single-agent arm, with grade 3 or 4 treatment-related AEs [occurring in 18.9% of those who received the combination] vs 9.7% [of those who received single-agent nivolumab]. However, in the context of clinical practice and prior data with nivolumab monotherapy, most studies have shown a grade 3 or 4 AE rate [ranging from] 10% to 15%. Having a new combination that offers that much more PFS benefit with [just a minimal] increase in toxicity is remarkable. It is indistinguishable from [prior data with] single-agent PD-1 treatment. This is added value because we are used to having to pay the tax of toxicity [with effective combination regimens]. Now, our patients can thankfully have benefit with a limited increase in toxicity. What are the next steps for this combination? This is still an early result. Obviously, [the trial] met its primary end point, but it is still early. We still want to see long-term OS data, the durability of these responses, and we want to see this combination work in other settings. For example, this study excluded patients with brain metastases; it only enrolled treatment-naïve patients and it did not include patients with uveal melanoma. As such, [we still have] many questions, but it puts us in a place where we have a new tool in our armamentarium that can help our patients. Reference Lipson EJ, Tawbi HAH, Schadendorf D, et al.

In patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), due to their heterogeneity and longer survival, it is expected that the prevalence of malnutrition is probably underdiagnosed, as well as the existence of a negative impact on different parameters (quality of life, survival). So far, the studies carried out on nutrition and NET are very scarce and none has been carried out so far in Spain.\n\nBefore being able to carry out nutritional intervention studies on these patients, it is necessary to know the reality of the nutritional status of patients with NETs in Spain. The main motivation for the NUTRIGETNE study is to evaluate the epidemiological status of nutrition in NETs in the spanish population. In addition to know the epidemiological picture, it is intended to study the nutritional status from different points of view: analytical, clinical, anthropometric, etc. Besides, the study of nutritional status will allow us to closely monitor the patients who have a higher risk of malnutrition and to propose early interventions for those, as well as the impact of their nutritional status on different parameters: survival, hospitalization, quality of life or responses to the treatments.\n\nNUTRIGETNE is a cross-sectional, open and multicenter study in which the nutritional status of patients with GEP NET in Spain will be evaluated.",

In addition to blocking the formation of new blood cells in tumors, cabozantinib also blocks pathways that may be responsible for allowing cancers cells to become resistant to other \"anti-angiogenic\" drugs. Cabozantinib has been studied or is being study in research studies as a possible treatment for various types of cancer, including prostate cancer, brain cancer, thyroid cancer, lung cancer, and kidney cancer.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators wish to learn if cabozantinib is effective in treating patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine and carcinoid tumors.",
      "detailed_description": "Subjects will take cabozantinib orally, once per day, in cycles of 28 days.\n\nDuring each cycle subjects will have the following procedures:\n\n* Physical examination, including measurement of weight and vital signs\n* Questions regarding any side effects\n* Blood sample (about 1 tablespoon) for routine laboratory tests of blood cell counts, blood chemistries, organ function and blood clotting\n* Blood sample (about 4 tablespoons) for research test to measure biomarkers to assess the response to study drug\n* Urine sample for routine urine tests to monitor health\n\nOn Day 15 (beginning of week 3) during the first 3 cycles:\n\n* Physical examination, including measurement of weight and vital signs\n* Questions regarding any side effects\n* Blood sample (about 1 tablespoon) for routine laboratory tests of blood cell counts, blood chemistries, organ function and blood clotting\n* Blood sample (about 4 tablespoons) for research test to measure biomarkers to assess the response to study drug Subjects will receive a CT scan or MRI every two cycles (every two months) to evaluate disease.",

Three patients had partial responses (PRs) with respective target lesion shrinkages of 89%, 78%, and 56%. At a median follow-up of 4.6 months (range, 1.4-7.4) for 9 total patients, the median overall survival was not reached, and 6 of the 9 patients were still alive. Among patients with activated B-cell–like (ABC) DLBCL (n = 6), 4 patients responded and 1 had stable disease, translating to a disease control rate of 83%. “These results represent a promising step forward in improving outcomes for [patients with] DLBCL and underscores the potential of [tambiciclib] in combination with zanubrutinib to deliver meaningful clinical benefits,” Angelos Stergiou, MD, ScD hc, president and chief executive officer of SELLAS Life Sciences Group, stated in a news release. “Achieving an ORR that significantly exceeds expectations, along with a CR response and multiple PRs is a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation in tackling this challenging disease. We believe that the combination of [tambiciclib] and zanubrutinib demonstrates a synergy that could pave the way for more effective treatment options. Moving forward, GenFleet will determine the next steps regarding the trial’s continuation around lymphoma as SELLAS’ focus remains in acute myeloid leukemia and spliceosome – chromatin mutations, including ASXL1 mutations.” The ongoing multicenter, open-label, nonrandomized, single-arm phase 1/2 study is enrolling patients at least 18 years of age with relapsed/refractory DLBCL including DLBCL not otherwise specified, T-cell/histiocyte-rich LBCL, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, or LBCL transformed from indolent B-cell lymphoma. 2 Patients need to have disease that was relapsed or refractory following 2 to 4 prior lines of therapy that included an anthracycline and rituximab (Rituxan). Other key inclusion criteria consist of at least 1 measurable lesion; unsuitability to undergo stem cell transplant; an ECOG performance status of 0 to 2; and adequate organ function. Patients are excluded if they have primary or secondary central nervous system lymphoma; have primary resistance to CDK9 or BTK inhibitors; or have a history of organ transplantation or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In the phase 1 portion of the study, patients received tambiciclib at 75 mg, 60 mg, or 100 mg once per week in combination with 160 mg of zanubrutinib twice per day until disease progression. In phase 2, tambiciclib is being given at the recommended phase 2 dose identified in phase 1 along with the same zanubrutinib regimen. ORR is the primary end point of phase 2. Among the 9 patients enrolled and treated thus far in the phase 2 portion of the study, 6 had ABC DLBCL, and 3 had germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL. 1 Patients had a median age of 55 years and received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy (range, 2-4). Safety data showed that grade 3 or higher adverse effects occurred in 55.6% of patients. A genetic analysis showed that no evaluable patients (n = 6) harbored MYD88 or CD79B mutations, which could be predictive of improved response to BTK inhibitors. The patient who achieved a CR harbored a MYC amplification and a TP53 mutation. “These additional data from yet another indication help us further expand the scope of [tambiciclib],” Dragan Cicic, MD, chief development officer of Sellas, added in a news release. “In parallel with our very advanced clinical development in AML, we are continuously working on additional clinical and preclinical programs in other indications and uncovering genetic biomarkers that make all the difference in today’s drug development.” References SELLAS announces positive data from phase 2a trial of SLS009 in combination with zanubrutinib in DLBCL.

      "brief_summary": "The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of arginine/lysine solution administration on serum potassium levels. A systematic assessment of serum potassium levels was performed during infusion and up to 24 hours post start of infusion compared to baseline.",
      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consisted of a screening period followed by an infusion day with an optional overnight in-clinic stay, and a follow up call 48h post infusion.\n\nScreening Phase:\n\nAt screening, patient eligibility was determined according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, with evaluation of patient's vital signs, ECG and laboratory parameters. The duration of screening could be as short as one day but could not exceed 7 days. Patients who showed potassium level \\> 6.0 mmol/L (\\> 5.5 mmol/L for Poland only) at screening could have their potassium level corrected and could be re-screened afterwards.\n\nTreatment Phase:\n\nEligible patients were admitted to the in-clinic unit and dosed with arginine/lysine solution for infusion of 1,000 mL, which was administered intravenously over a period of 4 hours. Before the infusion (at 0 h time point), a set of baseline tests were performed. During and after the infusion, patient condition was monitored for evaluation of any adverse events. Only patients with a potassium level of ≤ 6 mmol/L at screening (\\> 5.5 mmol/L for Poland only) were allowed to be dosed. Potassium testing on the infusion day was performed at 0h (before the infusion), and at 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, and 24h after the start of infusion. Vital signs and ECGs were taken as specified in the assessment schedule. All patients were monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia, e.g. dyspnoea, weakness, numbness, chest pain and cardiac manifestations (conduction abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias). Other common adverse reactions during arginine/lysine solution administration are nausea and vomiting. Before the start of arginine/lysine solution infusion, an intravenous bolus of an anti-emetic was given. The choice of anti-emetic drugs was at the discretion of the physician.\n\nFollow-up Phase:\n\nAll patients were called for a safety follow-up in 48 hours after dosing. Patients were not scheduled to receive repeat dosing with arginine/lysine solution as concomitant medication with Lutathera® within 7 days of the arginine/lysine solution infusion in the study.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NETs), who are eligible for the treatment with Lutathera as per Lutathera label indication.\n* Patients who have provided a signed informed consent form to participate in the study, obtained prior to the start of any protocol related procedures.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Pre-existing hyperkalemia (\\>6.0 mmol/L at screening) if not adequately corrected before starting the LysaKare (arginine/lysine) infusion. For Poland only, pre-existing hyperkalemia (\\> 5.5 mmol/L at screening) if not adequately corrected before starting the LysaKare (arginine/lysine) infusion.\n* Instances when Lutathera is not recommended per the Lutathera Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC).\n* Pregnancy or lactation, positive pregnancy test at screening or pre-dose based on the contraindication for Lutathera.\n* Any significant medical or social condition which may interfere with the subject's ability to comply with the study visit schedule or the study assessments.\n* Patients who have received any investigational agent within the last 30 days.\n* Patients that have received a dose of Lutathera prior to the screening visit or are scheduled for Peptide Receptor Repeat (PRRT) treatment within 7 days of the study infusion of arginine/lysine solution.\n* Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.\n\nExclusion Criteria (Poland Only):\n\n- Pre-existing hyperkalemia (\\> 5.5 mmol/L at screening) if not adequately corrected before starting the arginine/lysine solution infusion.",

      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to learn if a new drug, ONC201 can make tumors become smaller or go away completely. Investigators also want to learn if ONC201 can prevent new deposits of cancer from appearing in new places in participants (metastases). A phase 2 study of ONC201 in PC-PG (pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma) and other neuroendocrine tumors will determine whether inhibition of DRD2 (a member of the dopamine receptor family) is safe in unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, refractory, or metastatic neuroendocrine cancers including PC-PG, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), Ewing sarcoma (PNET) or any other neuroendicrine tumor with a catecholamine or dopamine biomarker or autocrine or paracrine dependence on dopamine including cholangiocarcinoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma.\n\nONC201 is an investigational (experimental) agent and has a favorable safety profile in phase 1 and early phase 2 clinical trials in advanced cancers. This study design has been chosen to see whether ONC201 is associated with reduction of anti-hypertension medications, safety and significant efficacy against neuroendocrine tumors, especially PC-PG.",
      "detailed_description": "Primary Objective To demonstrate objective responses using MRI or CT, and/or PET-CT imaging. The same CT or MRI imaging to assess disease burden at study entry will be compared at week 6 and 3 months. Patients without progression at 3 months will continue treatment and have imaging at 6, 9 and 12 months after study entry. Metabolic response and/or biomarkers will be compared with study entry PET-CT and scans at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months.\n\nSecondary Objectives Progression - free Survival: This will be calculated according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) or development of new disease\n\nOverall survival: Overall survival will be determined by email or telephone contact.\n\nStudy Design: Phase 2 open-label fixed dose study Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors including PC-PG are rare diseases.\n\nThe current recommended phase II dose of 625 mg orally on 2 consecutive days every week will be used. The same imaging at study entry will be used at subsequent time points (CT or MRI for week 6 and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) Imaging modality choice will be influenced by the quality of prior scans of the subject and will be ordered so clinical comparison is possible.\n\nBecause of travel and lodging considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, some information by the study team/PI may be obtained using virtual visits and 2nd read of scans sent to Cleveland Clinic",

ONC201 is a bitopic DRD2 antagonist with preclinical ONC201 activity in desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT). Patients and methods: Patients (N = 30) with neuroendocrine tumors were treated on this investigator-initiated trial ( NCT03034200 ). ONC201 dose and schedule were 625 mg orally weekly in cohorts A (PC-PG) + B (other neuroendocrine tumors) and 625 mg orally on 2 consecutive days each week in cohort C, which included 5 responding patients. The primary endpoint was radiographic response measured using RECIST. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Results: In arm A (n = 10; all PC-PG), 50% (5/10) exhibited a partial response (PR) and 2 additional patients had stable disease (SD) >3 months. Median duration of therapy for arm A patients was 9 months (range: 1.5-33 months) with 5 patients treated >1 year. In arm B (n = 12), there were 1 PR (DSRCT) and 2 SD (DSRCT; neuroblastoma) >3 months. Median duration of therapy in arm A was 18 months (range: 1-33 months) and arm B was 3 months (range: 1.5-33 months). Arm C PC-PG (N = 8) showed 1 PR and 7 SD at 3 months, with median duration of therapy >10 months. There was no decline in Karnofsky performance status at week 12 for 28 of 30 patients and no dose modification due to treatment-related adverse events. Conclusions: Oral ONC201 was well tolerated in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and associated with clinical benefit, including tumor responses, particularly in some patients with DSRCT and the majority of patients with PC-PG.

Each subject will be followed up overall survival (OS) time or the date of withdrawal and subjects who remain alive after study completion will have their OS time censored on the last date known to be alive. Eligible subjects will be enrolled to receive at least one dose of sunitinib orally at 37.5 mg once a day on a continuous daily dosing regimen (CDD) or dosage modification is based on daily clinic practice. Subjects will be treated until disease progress, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal from the study at their own request, or until the final analysis for the study is performed. The NI study will capture observations that will be used for evaluating the safety profile of sunitinib, including: subject demographics, medical history and medications. Safety assessments, treatment data and any other laboratory examination results, which were done according to routine clinical practice, will be collected at all visits.",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without cediranib works in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib and cediranib may help treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",

To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured by radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), as compared to olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, radiographic response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1, and overall survival (OS), as compared to olaparib monotherapy in patients with mCRPC.\n\nII. To evaluate association of homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair deficiency (HRD) with the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib or olaparib monotherapy, as measured by rPFS, in mCRPC patients.\n\nIII. To evaluate the safety the combination of cediranib and olaparib and olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing in mCRPC patients and correlate that with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nII. To characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes, angiogenesis markers, and immune markers, by whole transcriptome sequencing and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIII. To characterize changes in immune tumor microenvironment in mCRPC patients by profiling expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIV. To identify baseline predictive biomarkers for rPFS or response and to identify on-treatment markers of acquired resistance in men with mCRPC receiving either olaparib plus cediranib or olaparib alone.\n\nV. To explore biomarker signatures that correlate with the clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib, including changes in gene expression or acquired mutations in tumor biopsies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.",

We investigated whether cediranib combined with olaparib improves the clinical outcomes of patients with prostate cancer. Methods: Patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were randomly assigned 1:1 to arm A: cediranib 30 mg once daily plus olaparib 200 mg twice daily or arm B: olaparib 300 mg twice daily alone. The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in the intention-to-treat patients. The secondary end points were rPFS in patients with HRR-deficient and HRR-proficient mCRPC. Results: In the intention-to-treat set of 90 patients, median rPFS was 8.5 (95% CI, 5.4 to 12.0) and 4.0 (95% CI, 3.2 to 8.5) months in arms A and B, respectively. Cediranib/olaparib significantly improved rPFS versus olaparib alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.617; 95% CI, 0.392 to 0.969; P = .0359). Descriptive analyses showed a median rPFS of 10.6 (95% CI, 5.9 to not assessed [NA]) and 3.8 (95% CI, 2.33 to NA) months (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.272 to 1.504) among patients with HRR-deficient mCRPC, and 13.8 (95% CI, 3.3 to NA) and 11.3 (95% CI, 3.8 to NA) months (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.321 to 2.988) among patients with BRCA2 -mutated mCRPC in arms A and B, respectively. The incidence of grades 3-4 adverse events was 61% and 18% in arms A and B, respectively. Conclusion: Cediranib combined with olaparib improved rPFS compared with olaparib alone in men with mCRPC. This combination was associated with an increased incidence of grades 3-4 adverse events. BRCA2 -mutated subgroups treated with olaparib with or without cediranib were associated with a numerically longer median rPFS. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02893917 .

                "full_content": "Joseph W. Kim, MD The combination of cediranib and olaparib (Lynparza) significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) compared with olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), according to findings from a phase 2 trial (NCT02893917), which were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . 1 However, the combination was also associated with an increased rate of adverse effects (AEs). At a data cutoff of October 1, 2020, and a median follow-up of 26.1 months, of the 90 patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the median rPFS was 8.47 months (95% CI, 5.37-12.00) in patients who received the combination vs 3.97 months (95% CI, 3.23-8.47) in patients who received olaparib alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.617; 95% CI, 0.392-0.969; P = .0359). “Our randomized study evaluated whether combining an antiangiogenic agent, cediranib, with olaparib can improve the outcomes of patients with mCRPC,” lead study author, Joseph W. Kim, MD, of Yale School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut, and colleagues, wrote. PARP inhibition is a standard treatment option for patients with mCRPC with deleterious homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations. Preclinical studies in prostate, breast, and lung cancer cell lines have shown that a hypotoxic tumor microenvironment downregulates HRR gene expression, thereby increasing PARP inhibition sensitivity. Olaparib has previously demonstrated improvements in rPFS and overall survival (OS) compared with abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) or enzalutamide (Xtandi). Cediranib, a pan-vascular EGFR inhibitor, has been shown in preclinical models to suppress HRR gene expression and increase sensitivity to PARP inhibition. Eligible patients for this phase 2 trial included those at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma that was metastatic, progressive, and castration-resistant by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria. Patients needed to have received at least 1 prior therapy for mCRPC, and they were required to have an ECOG performance status of 1 or less, a Karnofsky score of at least 70%, and adequate organ function. Patients were excluded if they had received prior PARP inhibitors, although prior platinum-based chemotherapy was allowed. This trial had a primary end point of investigator-assessed rPFS in the ITT population. Secondary end points included rPFS in patients with HRR-deficient and HRR-proficient mCRPC, OS, overall response rate (ORR) in patients with measurable disease by RECIST v1.1 criteria, prostate-specific antigen 50 (PSA50) response rate, and toxicity. Between August 2017 and February 2019, 90 patients with mCRPC were randomized 1:1. Arm A (n = 45) received cediranib orally at 30 mg once daily plus olaparib orally at 200 mg twice daily. In this arm, cediranib dose reductions to 20 mg and 15 mg once daily and olaparib dose reductions to 150 mg and 100 mg twice daily were permitted. Arm B (n = 45) received oral olaparib alone at 300 mg twice daily. In this arm, 2 dose reductions of olaparib, to 250 mg and 200 mg twice daily, were allowed. Patients in arm B had the option to cross over to arm A upon radiographic progression. In total, 38% (n = 17) of patients in arm B crossed over to arm A upon radiographic progression. Patients continued study treatment until radiographic disease progression, grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs) that did not resolve to grade 1 or less by 14 days, or withdrawal of consent. In each arm, 22% of patients (n = 10) had liver metastases. A total of 44% (n = 20) and 26% (n = 12) of patients in arms A and B, respectively, had received at least 2 prior cytotoxic chemotherapies. All patients underwent tumor biopsies at baseline and during week 4 of treatment. Patients also provided a whole-blood sample for germline DNA. Tumors were determined to be homologous recombination deficient (HRD) if they had a biallelic loss or deleterious mutation in the ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDK12 (somatic mutations only), NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D genes. Tumors without these mutations were classified as HRR-proficient. A total of 93% (n = 84) of patients had sufficient tumor samples for HRR gene sequencing with BROCA homologous recombination assay. This sequencing showed that 29% (n = 26) of these patients had tumors with at least 1 deleterious HRR gene mutation and were classified as having HRD-positive disease. Of these patients, 26% (n = 12) and 31% (n = 14) were in arms A and B, respectively. Among all 84 patients with sequenced tumors, the most common HRR gene mutations were in BRCA2 (18%; n = 16), CDK12 (9%; n = 8), and ATM (3%; n = 3). Of the patients with BRCA2 mutations, 9 were in arm A and 7 were in arm B. Two patients in each arm had germline BRCA2 mutations. One patient, whose best overall response was progressive disease, had a BRCA2 reversion mutation. Among the patients with HRD-positive disease, a descriptive analysis showed a median rPFS of 10.63 months (95% CI, 5.90-not assessed [NA]) in arm A and 3.83 months (95% CI, 2.33-NA) in arm B (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.272-1.504). Among patients with BRCA2 -mutated disease, a descriptive analysis showed a median rPFS of 13.8 months (95% CI, 3.3-NA) and 11.3 months (95% CI, 3.8-NA) in arms A and B, respectively (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.321-2.988). In patients with HRR-proficient disease, the median rPFS 5.47 months (95% CI, 3.73-11.77) and 4.03 months (95% CI, 3.73-8.47) in arms A and B, respectively (HR, 0.777; 95% CI, 0.448-1.348). At the median follow-up, 42 patients had died. The median OS was 11.77 months (95% CI, 10.33-NA) and 17.37 months (95% CI, 15.5-NA) in arms A and B, respectively (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.705-2.399). A total of 71% (n = 64) of patients were evaluable for objective response by RECIST v1.1 criteria. The ORRs were 19% (n = 6/31) and 12% (n = 4/33) in arms A and B, respectively. Of the patients with HRD-positive disease, the ORRs were 14% (n = 1/7) and 22% (n = 2/9) in arms A and B, respectively. Of the patients with HRR-proficient disease, the ORRs were 24% (n = 5/21) and 9% (n = 2/23) in arms A and B, respectively. The median durations of response were 4.3 months (range, 1.9-17.7) and 5.8 months (range, 2.8-21.4) in arms A and B, respectively. The PSA50 response rates were 20% (n = 9/45) in arm A and 13% (n = 6/45) in arm B. Of the patients with HRD-positive disease, the PSA50 response rates were 42% (n = 5/12) and 36% (n = 5/14) in arms A and B, respectively. Of the patients with HRR-proficient disease, the PSA50 response rates were 10% (n = 3/29) and 3% (n = 1/29) in arms A and B, respectively. Safety analyses with the combination were consistent with previous reports in other tumors, and safety analyses with the monotherapy were consistent with previous reports in prostate cancer. Of the 90 patients enrolled to the study, 89 received at least 1 dose of study treatment and were included in the safety analysis. In total, 94% (n = 84) experienced TRAEs. The frequency of TRAEs was similar between the 2 arms, at 95% and 93% in arms A and B, respectively. The incidence of grade 3 to 4 AEs was 61% in arm A and 18% in arm B. Grade 3 and 4 AEs in arm A included hypertension (23%), fatigue or asthenia (16%), and diarrhea (9%). There was also an increased incidence of other all-grade AEs in arm A, such as anorexia (48%) and weight loss (25%). AEs were manageable with supportive care but contributed to dose interruption. In total, 84% (n = 37) of patients in arm A and 36% (n = 16) of patients in arm B required dose reductions because of an AE. Additionally, 25% of patients in arm A discontinued treatment because of an AE. No acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome was reported. One patient in arm A experienced a fatal treatment-related intracranial hemorrhage. This patient had a history of fall prior to enrollment and died from subdural hematoma on day 5 of the study. “To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the potential efficacy of combining an antiangiogenic agent with a [PARP] inhibitor for patients with mCRPC. Further correlative studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of synergy between these 2 agents in prostate cancer and to provide a clearer direction for the clinical development,” the study authors concluded.

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of first-line [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE ( 177 Lu-Dotatate) treatment. Methods: NETTER-2 was an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, superiority, phase 3 trial. We enrolled patients (aged ≥15 years) with newly diagnosed higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 >20% and ≤55%), somatostatin receptor-positive (in all target lesions), advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours from 45 centres across nine countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. We used interactive response technologies to randomly assign (2:1) patients to receive four cycles (cycle interval was 8 weeks ± 1 week) of intravenous 177 Lu-Dotatate plus intramuscular octreotide 30 mg long-acting repeatable (LAR) then octreotide 30 mg LAR every 4 weeks ( 177 Lu-Dotatate group) or high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR every 4 weeks (control group), stratified by neuroendocrine tumour grade (2 vs 3) and origin (pancreas vs other). Tumour assessments were done at baseline, week 16, and week 24, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded, independent, central radiology assessment. We did the primary analysis at 101 progression-free survival events as the final progression-free survival analysis. NETTER-2 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03972488 , and is active and not recruiting. Findings: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Oct 13, 2022, we screened 261 patients, 35 (13%) of whom were excluded. We randomly assigned 226 (87%) patients (121 [54%] male and 105 [46%] female) to the 177 Lu-Dotatate group (n=151 [67%]) and control group (n=75 [33%]). Median progression-free survival was 8·5 months (95% CI 7·7-13·8) in the control group and 22·8 months (19·4-not estimated) in the 177 Lu-Dotatate group (stratified hazard ratio 0·276 [0·182-0·418]; p<0·0001). During the treatment period, adverse events (of any grade) occurred in 136 (93%) of 147 treated patients in the 177 Lu-Dotatate group and 69 (95%) of 73 treated patients in the control group. There were no study drug-related deaths during the treatment period. Interpretation: First-line 177 Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide LAR significantly extended median progression-free survival (by 14 months) in patients with grade 2 or 3 advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. 177 Lu-Dotatate should be considered a new standard of care in first-line therapy in this population.

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Purpose of review: Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are rare and heterogeneous malignancies whose natural evolution may be defined according to various prognostic factors, including localization of the primitive tumour, hormone secretory status, histological grade, tumour burden, tumour growth rate, expression of somatostatin receptors and fluorodeoxyglucose-avidity. The treatment of these tumours in an advanced setting is based on relatively little robust data. Recent findings: A recent pathological classification introduced a new category of high-grade but well differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NET G3), with markedly different behaviour from neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). Yet, the optimal treatment of those tumours is still uncertain. Advances are needed in molecular subtyping of NENs to understand better their heterogeneity and inform personalized therapies. Summary: The current review summarizes the current knowledge, indicates some exciting future directions and outlines the most interesting ongoing clinical trials likely to impact current practice.

                "full_content": "Marianne E. Pavel, MD Efficacy benefits provided by lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (177Lu-Dotatate; Lutathera) over high-dose octreotide as first-line treatment in patients with advanced, well-differentiated, grade 2 or 3 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) proved to be consistent after adjustment for baseline covariates, according to data from a post-hoc, multivariate analysis of the phase 3 NETTER-2 trial (NCT03972488) presented during the 2024 ESMO Congress . 1 The key objectives of the analysis were to examine the effect of the therapy when adjusted for baseline covariates, including disease spread, and to determine potential prognostic factors, Marianne E. Pavel, MD, of the Department of Medicine 1, Uniklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nümberg, in Erlangen, Germany, said in an oral presentation of the data. Pavel and colleagues applied a multivariate Cox regression model for progression-free survival (PFS) and a logistic regression model for overall response rate (ORR) to select baseline covariates of age (<65 vs ≥65 years), sex (male vs female), primary disease site (pancreas vs small intestine vs other), NET grade (G2 vs G3 low [Ki67 ≤30%] vs G3 high [Ki67 >30%]), Ki67 as a continuous variable, metastatic spread (liver metastases only with or without lymph nodes vs other metastases), chromogranin A (CgA; ≤2 x upper limit of normal [ULN] vs >2 x ULN), somatostatin receptor (SSTR) uptake score (3 [>liver, <spleen] vs 4 [>spleen]). When adjusted for covariates, they found that effects on PFS and ORR were minimally affected. With regard to PFS, the hazard ratio (HR) for PFS in the primary analysis with 177Lu-Dotatate vs high-dose octreotide was 0.276 (95% CI, 0.182-0.418; P < .0001). In the exploratory analysis, the HR was 0.212 (95% CI, 0.134-0.337; P < .0001). With regard to ORR, in the primary analysis, the odds ratio (OR) was 7.81 (95% CI, 3.32-18.40; P < .0001). In the exploratory analysis, the OR was 10.43 (95% CI, 3.98-27.29; P <.0001). “Treatment benefit of Lu 177 dotatate [in terms of PFS and ORR] was consistent across all prespecified subgroups in the primary PFS analysis,” Pavel said. “Nevertheless, there were potential prognostic factors identified for PFS/response regardless of study treatment in this post-hoc analysis.” NETTER-2: Delving Into Design and Prior Data The trial enrolled patients with histologically confirmed, advanced G2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and G3 (Ki67 >20% and ≤55%), SSTR-positive GEP-NETs who received a diagnosis within 6 months of enrollment. They needed to be at least 15 years old and could not have previously received chemotherapy or targeted therapy in over 1 month. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive 177Lu-Dotatate at 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) every 8 weeks for 4 cycles plus octreotide at 30 mg long-acting repeatable (LAR) every 8 weeks during treatment with 177Lu-Dotatate and then every 4 weeks or high-dose octreotide at 60 mg LAR every 4 weeks. Patients who experienced progressive disease were able to enter into an optional treatment extension period where they would be retreated with 177Lu-Dotatate at the same dose with octreotide LAR if decided by the investigator every 8 weeks for 2 to 4 cycles, or crossover treatment with 177Lu-Dotatate at the same dose also every 8 weeks for 4 cycles plus octreotide at 30 mg LAR. They then entered into a follow-up period with visits happening every 6 months for the duration of 3 years. Stratification factors included NET grade (G2 vs G3) and tumor origin (pancreatic NET vs other). Prior data related to the primary end point showed that the median PFS in the 177Lu-Dotatate group was 22.8 months vs 8.5 months in the high-dose octreotide group (stratified HR, 0.276; 95% CI, 0.182-0.418; P < .0001). In the subgroup of patients with G2 NETs, the HR for PFS was 0.306 (95% CI, 0.176-0.530); in the subgroup of patients with G3 NETs, the HR was 0.266 (95% CI, 0.145-0.489). Previous findings regarding the secondary end point of ORR indicated that the 177Lu-Dotatate regimen elicited an ORR of 43.0% vs 9.3% with the control regimen (stratified OR, 7.81; 95% CI, 3.32-18.40; P < .0001). In the subgroups of patients with G2 or G3 NETs, the respective ORs were 5.83 (95% CI, 2.12-16.00) and 11.57 (95% CI, 2.48-53.97), respectively. Breaking Down the Baseline Characteristics In the 177Lu-Dotatate arm (n = 151), the median patient age was 61 years (range, 23-88); the median age was 60 years (range, 34-82) in the high-dose octreotide arm. Across the arms, most patients were female (54% vs 53%), had a primary tumor located in the pancreas (54% vs 55%), had G2 NET grade at diagnosis (66% vs 64%), CgA above 2 x ULN (70% vs 65%), and SSTR uptake score of 4 (63% vs 67%). In the 177Lu-Dotatate arm, 56% of patients did not have metastases in the liver only vs 48% of those in the high-dose octreotide arm. The median Ki67 index in the respective arms was 17 (range, 10-50) and 16 (range, 10-50). Post-Hoc Analysis Reveals Potential Prognostic Factors Investigators were able to identify possible prognostic factors with regard to PFS or ORR, irrespective of study treatment. They found that having a small intestine NET origin (small intestine vs pancreas: HR, 0.499; 95% CI, 0.275-0.906; P = .0222), lower CgA (>2 x ULN vs ≤2 x ULN: HR, 1.905; 95% CI, 1.127-3.222; P = .0162), lower Ki67 score (continuous variable: HR, 1.064; 95% CI, 1.009-1.123; P = .0228), and higher SSTR uptake score (4 vs 3: HR, 0.560; 95% CI, 0.296-1.058; P = .0739) led to varying improvements in PFS. Moreover, pancreatic NET origin (small intestine vs pancreas: HR, 0.315; 95% CI, 0.133-0.747; P = .0087) and lower CgA (>2 x ULN vs ≤2 x ULN: HR, 0.427; 95% CI, 0.196-0.926; P = .0312) were linked with varying improvements in objective response. “Disease spread had limited impact on PFS and ORR,” Pavel concluded.

Regarding safety, findings were consistent with the known toxicity profile of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, and no new or unexpected safety signals were reported. Detailed findings from NETTER-2 will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with health authorities. “These positive results for [lutetium Lu 177 dotatate] are quite remarkable and they represent the potential for radioligand therapy to make a meaningful impact for newly diagnosed patients living with advanced GEP-NETs,” Jeff Legos, executive vice president and global head of Oncology Development at Novartis, stated in a news release. “Exploring the use of radioligand therapies in earlier lines of treatment for patients with cancer is part of our larger, collaborative effort to precisely deliver novel treatment modalities directly to the cancer cells to improve patient outcomes.” In January 2018, the FDA approved lutetium Lu 177 dotatate for the treatment of patients with SSTR-positive GEP-NETs. 2 NETTER-2 was an open-label, multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 3 trial that enrolled patients at least 15 years of age and more than 40 kg of body weight with histologically proven, SSTR-positive, metastasized or locally advanced, inoperable, well differentiated grade 2 or grade 3 GEP-NETs who were diagnosed within 6 months prior to enrollment. 3 Patients were required to have a Ki67 index of at least 10% and no more than 55%, a Karnofsky performance status of at least 60, and at least 1 measurable site of disease. Key exclusion criteria included documented progression per RECIST v1.1 criteria to previous treatments for the current GEP-NET at any time prior to randomization, a creatinine clearance of less than 40 mL/min, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 5.0 mmol/L, a white blood cell count of less than 2 x 109/L, a platelet count of less than 75 x 109/L, a total bilirubin of more than 3 times the upper limit of normal, and serum albumin of less than 3.0 g/dL, unless prothrombin time was within the normal range. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 7.4 GBq/200 mCi of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate once every 8 weeks (+/– 1 week) for 4 total doses plus 30 mg of long-acting octreotide every 8 weeks, or long-acting octreotide alone. Patients in the experimental arm had the option to receive 2 to 4 additional doses of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate following progression, and those in the control arm could receive up to 4 cycles of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate plus long-acting octreotide following progression. Other secondary end points included disease control rate, duration of response, time to decline of global health status, and safety.

      "detailed_description": "This is a multi-center, open label, phase IV study to provide continued supply of pasireotide to patients being treated in a current Novartis-sponsored study and who are benefiting from treatment with pasireotide alone or in combination with another treatment for Cushing's Disease and Acromegaly . Eligible patients are to be consented and can then continue treatment with pasireotide alone or in combination with another treatment for Cushing's Disease and Acromegaly in this protocol. All patients at their scheduled visits will have drug dispensing information and reported adverse events and serious adverse events collected.\n\nA patient will reach the end of study when pasireotide treatment is permanently discontinued and the end of treatment visit has been performed. All patients must be followed up for safety evaluations for 3 months following the last dose of pasireotide LAR treatment and for 1 month following the last dose of pasireotide s.c. treatment.\n\nThe study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years or until such time that enrolled patients no longer need treatment with pasireotide or are able to obtain commercial supply according to local regulations for their medical condition.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient is currently participating in a Novartis-sponsored study receiving pasireotide (LAR and/or s.c.) on monotherapy or combination therapy (for Cushing's Disease or Acromegaly), and has fulfilled all required assessments in the parent study and patients that are benefiting from the study treatment have no other alternatives.\n2. Patient is currently benefiting from the treatment with pasireotide, as determined by the investigator\n3. Patient has demonstrated compliance, as assessed by the investigator, with the parent study requirements.\n4. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other study procedures.\n5. Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in roll-over study and receiving study medication.\n\n   * If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient has been permanently discontinued from pasireotide study treatment in the parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance to study procedures, withdrawal of consent or any other reason.\n2. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.\n3. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 30 days after the final dose of pasireotide s.c. and 84 days after the final dose of pasireotide LAR. Highly effective contraception is defined as either:\n\n   * Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n   * Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n   * Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to enrolling). For female patients on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n   * Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate \\<1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\n   * In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.\n   * Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.\n   * Sexually active males, unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 1 months after pasireotide s.c. last dose and 3 months after pasireotide LAR last dose, should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.",

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Pasireotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) is a novel somatostatin analog (SSA) with avid binding affinity to somatostatin receptor subtypes 1, 2, 3 (SSTR1,2,3) and 5 (SSTR5). Results from preclinical studies indicate that pasireotide can inhibit neuroendocrine tumor (NET) growth more robustly than octreotide in vitro. This open-label, phase II study assessed the clinical activity of pasireotide in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic grade 1 or 2 NETs. Patients with metastatic pancreatic and extra-pancreatic NETs were treated with pasireotide LAR (60 mg every 4 weeks). Previous systemic therapy, including octreotide and lanreotide, was not permitted. Tumor assessments were performed every 3 months using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), overall radiographic response rate (ORR), and safety. Twenty-nine patients were treated with pasireotide LAR (60 mg every 4 weeks) and 28 were evaluable for response. The median PFS was 11 months. The most favorable effect was observed in patients with low hepatic tumor burden, normal baseline chromogranin A, and high tumoral SSTR5 expression. Median OS has not been reached; the 30-month OS rate was 70%. The best radiographic response was partial response in one patient (4%), stable disease in 17 patients (60%), and progressive disease in ten patients (36%). Although grade 3/4 toxicities were rare, pasireotide LAR treatment was associated with a 79% rate of hyperglycemia including 14% grade 3 hyperglycemia. Although pasireotide appears to be an effective antiproliferative agent in the treatment of advanced NETs, the high incidence of hyperglycemia raises concerns regarding its suitability as a first-line systemic agent in unselected patients. SSTR5 expression is a potentially predictive biomarker for response. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01253161 .

The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness and safety of Everolimus or Pasireotide LAR alone or in combination in adult patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) neuroendocrine carcinoma (typical and atypical) of the lung and thymus. It was expected that a total of 120 patients with 40 patients in each arm were to be enrolled into this study. Patients were seen weekly for one month and monthly thereafter. Radiological and biochemical response assessments were performed every 3 months.\n\nPatients with disease control (stable disease or better) in the combination arm or monotherapy with pasireotide LAR and everolimus who had not experienced unacceptable toxicity were permitted to continue treatment in the extension phase of the study and were seen every 3 months. Patients could remain in the extension phase as long as they continued to have clinical benefit and had not fulfilled any of the study discontinuation criteria.

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of long-acting pasireotide and everolimus, administered alone or in combination, in patients with advanced carcinoids of the lung or thymus. Methods: LUNA was a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial of adult patients (aged >18 years) with advanced (unresectable or metastatic), well differentiated carcinoid tumours of the lung or thymus, with radiological progression within 12 months before randomisation, and a WHO performance status of 0-2. At each centre, the investigator or their designee registered each patient using an interactive voice recognition system into one of the three treatment groups. The randomisation allocation sequence was generated by an external company; patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive treatment with long-acting pasireotide (60 mg intramuscularly every 28 days), everolimus (10 mg orally once daily), or both in combination, for the core 12-month treatment period. Patients were stratified by carcinoid type (typical vs atypical) and line of study treatment (first line vs others). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients progression-free at month 9, defined as the proportion of patients with overall lesion assessment at month 9 showing a complete response, partial response, or stable disease according to local Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01563354 . The extension phase of the study is ongoing. Findings: Between Aug 16, 2013, and Sept 30, 2014, 124 patients were enrolled from 36 centres in nine countries: 41 were allocated to the long-acting pasireotide group, 42 to the everolimus group, and 41 to the combination group. At month 9, the proportion of patients with an overall lesion assessment of complete response, partial response, or stable disease was 16 of 41 patients (39·0%, 95% CI 24·2-55·5) in the long-acting pasireotide group, 14 of 42 patients (33·3%, 19·6-49·5) in the everolimus group, and 24 of 41 patients (58·5%, 42·1-73·7) in the combination group. The most common grade 1-2 adverse events with a suspected association with long-acting pasireotide monotherapy were diarrhoea (15 [37%] of 41), hyperglycaemia (17 [41%]), and weight loss (8 [20%]); those with a suspected association with everolimus monotherapy were stomatitis (26 [62%] of 42) and diarrhoea (16 [38%]); and those suspected to be associated with combination treatment were hyperglycaemia (27 [66%] of 41]), diarrhoea (19 [46%]), and asthenia (8 [20%]). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events with a suspected association with long-acting pasireotide monotherapy were γ-glutamyltransferase increased (four [10%] of 41 patients), diarrhoea (three [7%]), and hyperglycaemia (three [7%]); those for everolimus were hyperglycaemia (seven [17%] of 42 patients), stomatitis (four [10%]), and diarrhoea (three [7%]); those for combination treatment were hyperglycaemia (nine [22%] of 41 patients) and diarrhoea (four [10%]). 11 patients died during the core 12-month treatment phase or up to 56 days after the last study treatment exposure date: two (5%) of 41 in the long-acting pasireotide group, six (14%) of 42 in the everolimus group, and three (7%) of 41 in the combination group. No deaths were suspected to be related to long-acting pasireotide treatment. One death in the everolimus group (acute kidney injury associated with diarrhoea), and two deaths in the combination group (diarrhoea and urinary sepsis in one patient, and acute renal failure and respiratory failure in one patient) were suspected to be related to everolimus treatment. In the latter patient, acute renal failure was not suspected to be related to everolimus treatment, but respiratory failure was suspected to be related. Interpretation: The study met the primary endpoint in all three treatment groups. Safety profiles were consistent with the known safety profiles of these agents. Further studies are needed to confirm the antitumour efficacy of the combination of a somatostatin analogue with everolimus in lung and thymic carcinoids. Funding: Novartis Pharma AG.

The study will enroll at least 8 patients in the GEP-NET cohort and as many adolescents with PPGL as possible in the exploratory PPGL cohort.",
      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consists of the screening period (up to 2 weeks) followed by the treatment period (4 treatment administrations at 8-week interval), and the follow-up period (10 years).\n\nThe treatment period will consist of 4 Lutathera treatments administered at 8-week intervals. Lutathera administration will occur on Week 1 Day 1 of each cycle. Each patient will receive a total of 4 doses of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi). An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with each Lutathera dose for renal protection according to the approved Lutathera local prescribing information. An antiemetic will be administered prior to infusion of the AA solution for prevention of infusion-related nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe dosimetry and PK assessments will be performed during the first week after the 1st Lutathera dose, i.e. one time during the study treatment period for each patient. The dosimetry analysis will allow for estimation from the 1st Lutathera administration of the cumulative absorbed radiation dose from 4 Lutathera doses and also for taking a decision on the next dose levels. In the exceptional circumstances when dosimetry cannot be performed in a particular patient after the first Lutathera dose, it should be completed as soon as feasible upon a later dose. In order to minimize risk for each study subject, an accelerated analysis of dosimetry and safety data will be performed for each patient in the study, to enable the Investigator to take a decision for the subsequent Lutathera doses. The results of dosimetry assessments (imaging and blood dosimetry) will be provided to the investigators for their evaluation prior to administration of subsequent therapeutic cycles in each patient.\n\nA total follow-up period of 10 years (120 months) after the last Lutathera dose will take place for each patient who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This follow-up period will be comprised of a short-term follow-up of 6 months to evaluate cumulative Lutathera toxicities, followed by a long-term follow up of another 114 months.\n\nAn external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also operate in the study to evaluate accumulating safety and dosimetry data, to ensure the safety of adolescents enrolled in the study, and to provide recommendations to investigators as well as to the clinical team in charge of conducting the study.",

Abstract Purpose: NETTER-P, an open-label Phase II study, evaluated the safety and dosimetry of [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (hereafter 177 Lu-DOTATATE) in adolescents with advanced, somatostatin receptor-positive, well-differentiated, Grade 1/2 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) or pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas (PPGL). Methods: Patients (12-17 years old) received four cycles of 177 Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8 ± 1 weeks; cumulative administered activity: 29.6 GBq). Primary endpoints were absorbed dose (kidneys and bone marrow) and safety after first administration. Safety during treatment and comparative assessments of dosimetry and pharmacokinetics between adolescents and historical adult patients were evaluated. Results: Eleven patients (4 GEP-NET, 7 PPGL; median age 15 [range, 13-17] years) were enrolled and received ≥ 1 administration of 177 Lu-DOTATATE. Median (range) cumulative administered activity was 28.2 (7.3-29.9) GBq. Lymphopenia/lymphocyte count decreased and headache were the most common adverse events (AEs) during Cycle 1 (each 4/11 [36%]). Cycle 1 Grade ≥ 3 AEs occurred in 4/11 patients (36%). During the treatment period, the most common AE was lymphopenia/lymphocyte count decreased (7/11 [64%]; Grade ≥ 3, 5/11 [45%]). No clinically meaningful impacts on safety biomarkers nor any treatment-related nephrotoxicities were observed. Projected median (range) cumulative absorbed doses (four administrations) were 21 (14-40) Gy in kidneys and 0.76 (0.55-1.0) Gy in bone marrow (using blood data). Dosimetry values were predicted to be within safety thresholds for adolescents and adults; pharmacokinetics were comparable in both populations.

Halperin, MD, associate professor, Department of Gastrointestinal Medical Oncology, Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, discusses the significance of the FDA approval of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (Lutathera) for pediatric patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR)–positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP NETs). On April 23, 2024, the FDA approved lutetium Lu 177 dotatate for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with SSTR-positive GEP-NETs, including foregut, midgut, and hindgut NETs. This regulatory decision was supported by safety findings from the phase 2 NETTER-P trial (NCT04711135), as well as safety and efficacy data from the phase 3 NETTER-1 trial (NCT01578239). In 2018, lutetium Lu 177 dotatate received FDA approval for the treatment of adult patients with SSTR-positive GEP-NETs based on data from NETTER-1. NETTER-P showed that the adverse effect (AE) profile of the radiopharmaceutical in 9 pediatric patients, including 4 with GEP-NETs, was similar to that observed in adult patients. The main outcomes of NETTER-P included absorbed radiation doses in target organs and the incidence of AEs after the first treatment cycle. Secondary outcomes included short-term AEs following treatment with the radiopharmaceutical. The recommended dose of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) every 8 weeks (± 1 week) for 4 total doses. Since pediatric NETs are rare tumors, a dearth of research exists surrounding optimal therapies for these patients, Halperin says. The past several years have seen many research and treatment advances for adult patients with NETs, prompting oncologists who treat pediatric patients with NETs to wonder whether those therapies are applicable in pediatric populations, Halperin explains. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapies, such as lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, are effective in adult populations, and the availability of this treatment approach for pediatric patients with GEP-NETs will hopefully improve disease outcomes in that population as well, Halperin concludes.",

The results of this randomized, blinded trial, which were presented during the 2021 NANETS Symposium, did not demonstrate a significant difference in the patient experience regarding comfort and pain with the injection with octreotide LAR vs lanreotide, Raj says. Among patients who received octreotide LAR first, the mean injection site pain score was 2.4 compared with 1.9 in patients who received lanreotide first, Raj explains. The difference in these pain scores was not statistically significant, Raj continues. Moreover, it is important to recognize that out of a 10-point scale, the pain experience by patients was relatively low overall, Raj concludes.",

Approved rapalogs such as everolimus inhibit mTORC1 and have limited clinical activity, possibly due to compensatory feedback loops. Sapanisertib addresses the potential for incomplete inhibition of the mTOR pathway through targeting of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, and thus to reverse resistance to earlier rapamycin analogues. In stage 1, patients received sapanisertib 3 mg by mouth once daily on a continuous dosing schedule in 28-day cycle. This trial adopted a two-stage design with the primary objective of evaluating objective tumor response. The first stage would recruit 13 patients in order to accrue 12 eligible and treated patients. If among the 12 eligible patients at least 1 patient had an objective response to therapy, the study would move to the second stage of accrual where 25 eligible and treated patients would be enrolled. This study activated on February 1, 2017, the required pre-determined number of patients (n = 13) had entered by November 5, 2018 for the first stage response evaluation. The accrual of this trial was formally terminated on December 27, 2019 as no response had been observed after the first stage accrual. Treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were reported in eight (61%) patients with hyperglycemia being the most frequent, in three patients (23%). Other toxicities noted in the trial included fatigue, rash diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The median PFS was 5.19 months (95% CI [3.84, 9.30]) and the median OS was 20.44 months (95% CI [5.65, 22.54]). Due to the lack of responses in Stage 1 of the study, the study did not proceed to stage 2. Thus the potential to reverse resistance was not evident.

The addition of immune checkpoint inhibition to platinum-based chemotherapy may improve survival. NICE-NEC ( NCT03980925 ) is a single-arm, phase II trial that recruited chemotherapy-naive, unresectable advanced or metastatic G3 NENs of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or unknown origin. Patients received nivolumab 360 mg intravenously (iv) on day 1, carboplatin AUC 5 iv on day 1, and etoposide 100 mg/m 2 /d iv on days 1-3, every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for up to 24 months, disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the 12-month overall survival (OS) rate (H 0 50%, H 1 72%, β 80%, α 5%). Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. From 2019 to 2021, 37 patients were enrolled. The most common primary sites were the pancreas (37.8%), stomach (16.2%) and colon (10.8%). Twenty-five patients (67.6%) were poorly differentiated carcinomas (NECs) and/or had a Ki67 index >55%. The ORR was 56.8%. Median PFS was 5.7 months (95%CI: 5.1-9) and median OS 13.9 months (95%CI: 8.3-Not reached), with a 12-month OS rate of 54.1% (95%CI: 40.2-72.8) that did not meet the primary endpoint. However, 37.6% of patients were long-term survivors (>2 years). The safety profile was consistent with previous reports. There was one treatment-related death. Nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with prolonged survival in over one-third of chemonaïve patients with G3 GEP-NENs, with a manageable safety profile. © 2024. The Author(s).

To assess progression-free survival (PFS) in advanced/metastatic in patients with carcinoid or pancreatic islet cell tumors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess overall survival and response rate in advanced/metastatic poor prognosis in patients with carcinoid or pancreatic islet cell tumors.\n\nII. To assess the toxicity of patients treated with regorafenib. III. To explore markers of angiogenesis as they relate to outcome in carcinoid and pancreatic islet cell tumors.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.",

      "detailed_description": "STZ plus 5-Fuorouracil (5FU) is the actual standard of care for advanced pancreatic Neuroendocrine tumours (pNETS) in the European Union. Everolimus has been recently approved for its use in advanced pNETs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in Europe by the European Medical Agency (EMA).\n\nA randomized study is needed to have a clear knowledge about the best sequence for its administration; this is, before or after palliative chemotherapy.\n\nThere may or may not be any benefits from giving first each other treatment of the study. The information obtained from this study will help the physician improve the treatment and management of patients with advanced pNET.\n\nThis study was planned to compare STZ-5FU chemotherapy followed by everolimus upon progression versus the reverse sequence. However sequential studies with pNETs are hard to be managed in terms of time and costs. Therefore the protocol was amended to have PFS1 (progression free survival after course 1) as primary endpoint and PFS2 (i.e. progression free survival after both STZ based chemotherapy and Everolimus or the reverse order) as secondary endpoint. This information will be extremely valuable for the day to day clinical practice of pNETs oncologists",

Treatment naive patients can be also included if the patient needs active treatment with either chemotherapy or everolimus.\n* Presence of measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.0, documented by a Triphasic Computed Tomography (CT) scan or multiphase MRI radiological assessment.\n* Previous treatment with somatostatin (SS) analogues is allowed. Only those patients with active functioning syndrome at entry can continue with SS analogues during the study.\n* Adequate bone marrow and renal functions, and serum fasting cholesterol\n* Women with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test.\n* Written Informed Consent obtained according to local regulations\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous treatment with chemotherapy and/or mTOR inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n* Immune therapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the patient entering the study.\n* Hepatic artery embolization within the last 6 months (1 month if there are other sites of measurable disease), or cryoablation/radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastasis within 2 months of enrolment.\n* Previous treatment with Peptide-Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) within the last 6 months and/or without progression following PRRT.\n* Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\n* Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions.\n* Treatment with potent inhibitors or inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A) isoenzyme within 5 days immediately before the start of treatment.\n* Patients on chronic treatment with corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressive agent.\n* Patients known to be HIV seropositive.\n* Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to everolimus or its excipients or other rapamycin analogues. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n* Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to 5FU or STZ or its excipients (notice that this criterion includes patients with known deficit of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency -DPD).\n* Pregnant, lactating women or fertile adults not using effective birth control methods.\n* For administrative matters (insurance) patients ≥ 95 are not allowed during the trial.\n\nOnly those patients coming from the hospital pool will be included in SEQTOR trial (e.g. persons detained in an institution as a result of an official or court order are excluded).",
