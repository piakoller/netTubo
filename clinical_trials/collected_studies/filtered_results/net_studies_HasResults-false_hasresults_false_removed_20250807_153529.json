      "brief_summary": "Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) is based on specific somatostatin receptor targeting with radiolabelled analogues 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE. These two most commonly used radiopeptides, 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE, produce overall objective response rates of 15-35%. PRRT is generally well tolerated with mild toxicity, if the necessary precautions, such as the co-administration of nephroprotective amino acids or the adjustment of the administered activity, are taken.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by surgical resection for resectable non-functioning PanNETs at high risk of recurrence.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the Rate of postoperative 90-day morbidity and mortality after neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by pancreatic resection and the secondary endpoints are:\n\n1. Rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for primary lesions' assessment, and modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), for liver metastases' assessment, if detected\n2. Quality of life (QoL) after neoadjuvant PRRT followed by pancreatic surgical resection.\n\nThe study is designed as a prospective phase II single-arm trial. 8 Italian centers will participate to the study (6 surgical sites, 2 nuclear medicine sites).\n\nPatients will be recruited for 12 months. The study will end 2 months after operation of the last patient enrolled and the total duration of the study will be 24 months.\n\nSample size estimation: 30 patients",
      "detailed_description": "Rationale:\n\nIn a recent study un initial experience was reported with neoadjuvant PRRT followed by surgical resection in patients affected by PanNETs. In this study, patients with resectable or potentially resectable PanNETs at high risk of recurrence after surgery who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT were compared with a group of patients who underwent upfront surgery. Of note, patients who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT had a significant lower risk of developing pancreatic fistula and a lower risk of postoperative complications. Moreover, among those patients who underwent curative resection, patients who received PRRT had a progression-free survival significantly longer after compared to upfront surgery. Neoadjuvant PRRT may be a valuable option to reduce the risk of failure after surgery in patients with PanNETs who are at high risk of recurrence. Nevertheless, the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT has never been investigated in a prospective trial.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by surgical resection for resectable non-functioning PanNETs at high risk of recurrence.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the Rate of postoperative 90-day morbidity and mortality after neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by pancreatic resection and the secondary endpoints are:\n\n1. Rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for primary lesions' assessment, and modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), for liver metastases' assessment, if detected.\n2. Quality of life (QoL) after neoadjuvant PRRT followed by pancreatic surgical resection.\n\nThe study is designed as a prospective phase II single-arm trial. 8 Italian centers will participate to the study (6 surgical sites, 2 nuclear medicine sites).\n\nPatients will be recruited for 12 months. The study will end 2 months after operation of the last patient enrolled and the total duration of the study will be 24 months.\n\nSample size:\n\nBy using the Single-Stage Phase II sample size method, we estimated a sample size of 30 patients to test if the proportion of patients without postoperative complications (responses) is more than or equal to 57% (p1 ) or less than equal to 39% (p0 ).\n\nTo be enrol in the study, all the patients should have a cytological/histological confirmation of PanNET and meet one or more inclusion criteria. Moreover, all the exclusion criteria should have been ruled out.\n\nPatients will undergo the following laboratory examinations at week 0, week 1, week 9, week 17, week 25, week 38, week 40, week 45-52: blood cell count, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, cloride, calcium, glucose, bilirubin, AST, ALT, LDH, GGT, ALP, Albumin, urine test. Gravindex will be executed at week 0, week 1, week 9, week 17, week 25, week 40 and they will be asked to fill a quality of life questionnaire at wwk 0, week 38, week 40-52.\n\nEnrolled patients will be treated with standard pancreatic resection according to PanNET localization, after a course (4 cycles) of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE.\n\nPatients will receive a cumulative activity of 29.600 MBq (800 mCi), divided in 4 administrations (or cycles) of 7.400 MBq (200 mCi) each, with treatment intervals of 6-8 weeks. The per-cycle activity of 177Lu-DOTATATE (and consequently the cumulative activity) might be reduced if relevant blood and renal toxicity, or other side effects, will occur during the course of PRRT.\n\n177Lu-DOTATATE will be slowly injected intravenously over a period of 30 minutes and using a dedicated pump-system of infusion.\n\nDuring the administration of the therapy, performed into a dedicated room of the Nuclear Medicine Division, the Health Physics staff will monitor the patient by means of an ionization chamber, in order to check the completeness of the radiopeptide administration.\n\nIn order to obtain an adequate hydration of the patient and to protect the renal parenchyma during the phase of excretion of the radiopharmaceutical from an excessive tubular reuptake of radiopetide, the administration of the radiopharmaceutical will be preceded and followed (without interruption) with intravenous infusion of 1000 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution containing L-Arginine hydrochloride and/or Lysine.\n\nThe gamma emission of 177Lu (113 and 208 KeV, relative abundance 6 and 11%, respectively) allows a suitable observation of the radiopharmaceutical biodistribution during the entire therapeutic phase.\n\nAfter 16-24 hours from administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE (and for each treatment cycle) patients will undergo anterior and posterior whole body scan (imaging will be acquired on a 128x512 matrix, by means a double-headed gamma-camera, equipped with a low-energy high-resolution collimator (LEHR), with energetic window set on 177Lu peaks.) in order to verify the correct bio-distribution of the radiopharmaceutical and its focal uptake into the target lesions.\n\nMoreover, at 1st and 4th cycle, when feasible and indicated, a more accurate imaging evaluation will be performed by using SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging (6-24 hours after administration), in order to quantify percentage of radiopharmaceutical uptake and half-life, absorbed dose, effective biological dose (BED), equivalent uniform dose (EUD) both in target lesions and critical organs (bone marrow and kidney) and correlate these parameters with the response to the treatment) and with the toxicity profile.\n\nAll patients will be re-evaluated 3 months after the 4th cycle of PRRT, in order to assess the rate of objective radiological response, according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1).\n\nPatients will undergo standard pancreatic surgery plus lymphadenectomy at one of the participating surgical site identified in the protocol. Pancreatic resection will be performed according to the localization and extended to nearby organs and/or vessels when invasion is present. Concomitant liver resection may be performed in the presence of liver metastasis.\n\nAssessment of outcomes. 90-day post-operative mortality and morbidity will be classified according to the definition proposed by Dindo et al.\n\nThe rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-OTATATE according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for primary lesions' assessment, and modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), for liver metastases' assessment, if detected.\n\nThe quality of life (QoL) at diagnostic workup, after neoadjuvant PRRT and after the pancreatic surgical resection, will be evaluated by EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire.\n\nData will be collected with CRFs and information will be recorded in a protected database.",

We will conduct a study of all newly occurring GEP-NET and lung NET cases aged 18 years and older diagnosed between 01/01/2018 through 09/30/2024 across 14 sites participating in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), enrolling an average of 215 patients per site over the 3 year study period (2515 patients total), allowing up to 60 months of follow-up for medical record outcomes. Participants will complete four online or paper surveys over 18 months; these surveys will focus on patient-reported outcomes, including questions on quality of life, treatment decisions, and experiences with cancer care. Survey data will be linked to participant medical record data to achieve study aims.",
      "detailed_description": "NETs are a group of neoplasms that occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and the lungs, collectively referred to as gastroenteropancreatic (GEP-NETs) and lung-NETs. There are currently fewer than 180,000 patients living with this condition in the United States, meeting the criteria for rare disease status. NETs are typically slow growing, with vague signs and a myriad of symptoms (carcinoid syndrome) leading to diagnostic delays. Thus, NET patients typically experience a prolonged clinical course with active disease, and many have significant symptom burdens. However, assessment of quality of life outside of therapy trials remains scarce and of poor quality. What's more, over half of GEP-NETs are diagnosed with spread of their disease at diagnosis and are not candidates for curative surgery. Fortunately, many of these tumors are amenable to long-term medical treatment with somatostatin analogues (SSAs)- which slow down the production of hormones, especially serotonin, which helps to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. However, living with distant spread of the disease increases the probability for the disease to progress. Following failure of first-line SSA therapy there are no clear consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of other therapeutic options. NET patients are left wondering not only 'what therapy would be best to try next?', but 'if I were to take this option now, what treatment options will be closed off to me in the future?' and clinicians are unsure as to how best to tailor treatment selection on the characteristics of the patient and their tumor.\n\nThere is currently no large nationally recruiting prospective (forward in time) observational study of NET patients. Our large study will robustly generate real-world evidence on the frequency and sequence of commonly used treatments for GEP and lung NET patients in relation to Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and survival/progression, endpoints that matter most to NET patients, their caregivers, and clinicians involved in their care. Given the lack of consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of treatments, evidence generated in this study will aid patient (and clinician) navigation and selection of the next most appropriate therapy, accounting for the preferences and needs of the individual patient, whilst respecting the underlying profile of their tumor. Moreover, the infrastructure this study will generate (i.e.: electronic identification of NET patients, entry and completion of tumor table data in PCORnet, and a unique NET patient health record portal), will foster future CER studies in NETs and other rare diseases.\n\nThe four specific aims of this project are:\n\n1. To describe the frequency of treatment regimens received by line of therapy, and examine their association with symptom burden and changes in 6, 12 and 18 month health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes. The influence of patient preferences, beliefs, attitudes, and experience of care on choice of these treatment regimens will also be examined.\n2. To examine the association of patient, clinical, and tumor characteristics on the selection of first-line and beyond treatment regimens and compare the effects of common treatment sequences on frequency of subsequent treatments received and outcomes of overall survival and disease progression.\n3. To compare the effectiveness of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) regimens on outcomes of renal toxicity, disease progression, and patient-reported symptoms and HRQoL.\n4. To disseminate lessons learned and expand enrollment of the prospective cohort to patient advocate organizations, and to use the infrastructure developed to aid in the study of other rare diseases.",

      "brief_summary": "Midgut neuroendocrine tumours present an increasing incidence and poor survival at 5 years with limited therapeutic options for metastatic, non-operable cases. Lu-177 Dotatate, targeting somatostatin receptors, is an internal vectorized radiotherapy using Lu-177, an ideal radionuclide for peptide radionuclide therapy. In NETTER-1 phase III randomized clinical trial, Lu-177 Dotatate proved its superiority in increasing progression free survival for midgut neuroendocrine tumors. This study hypothesize that finding biomarkers of individual radio sensitivity for this type of internal vectorized therapy would allow treatment personalization. The protocol aim at studying transcript variations induced by this therapy.",
      "detailed_description": "Internal vectorized therapy using Lu-177 Dotatate (abbreviated peptide receptor radionuclide therapy) was recently shown to improve progression free survival and response in metastatic progressive midgut neuroendocrine tumors (NETTER-1 phase III trial).\n\nLu-177 Dotatate is administered as a series of four consecutive intra veinous injections of an activity of 7.4 gigabequerel every 8 weeks.\n\nIn order to identify potential biomarkers of radio sensitivity to Lu-177 Dotatate, investigators aim to study the stability of gene/miRNA transcripts in the absence of Lu-177 Dotatate or at 6 months after treatment as well as the variations in transcript analysis after 2 Lu-177 Dotatate injections and at the end of the treatment.\n\nTranscript variation analysis will be confronted and correlated with peripheral blood pharmacokinetic studies aimed at calculating time activity curves and provide biodosimetry information; other correlations with imaging modalities assessment of dosimetry or disease response to treatment or toxicity effects induced by Lu-177 Dotatate will also be studied.",

Men who receive study therapy and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of study therapy. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception. WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes.

Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, or ipilimumab\n* Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including high dose systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not limited to: immune-related neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, or autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus (DM), or endocrine deficiencies (e.g., thyroiditis) managed with replacement hormones, including physiologic corticosteroids, are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication, and patients with positive serology, (e.g., antinuclear antibodies \\[ANA\\] or anti-thyroid antibodies) should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well temozolomide and capecitabine work compared to standard treatment with cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, capecitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Certain types of neuroendocrine carcinomas may respond better to treatments other than the current standard treatment of cisplatin and etoposide. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and capecitabine may work better than cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with this type of neuroendocrine carcinoma, called non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the PFS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the response rate (RR) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the RR of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nII. To assess the overall survival (OS) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the OS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nIII. To evaluate the toxicities associated with the combination of temozolomide and capecitabine and the combination of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide, respectively, in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the impact of each treatment regimen on PFS, RR and OS based on marker of proliferation Ki-67 index in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. (Laboratory) II. To assess the prognostic significance of well differentiated versus poorly differentiated non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in relationship to survival and response to treatment. (Laboratory) III. To assess the agreement in Ki-67 status between that reported by institutional pathologist and that reported by central pathology review. (Laboratory)\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 10-14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) on days 1-3 or carboplatin IV on day 1. Patients also receive etoposide IV on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.",

These patients have important supportive care needs that represent a major challenge for improving treatment tolerance and patient survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\n\nMalnutrition and sarcopenia (muscle wasting and dysfunction) are associated with an increased risk of death, complications from chemotherapy, infections, emergency procedures and hospitalizations, and increased costs of care. Therefore, malnutrition and sarcopenia represent a major clinical target in GI cancers.\n\nInterventions targeting malnutrition/sarcopenia should be implemented as early as possible in patients' pathways, these syndromes being reversible at early stages but not at late stages.\n\nA multidisciplinary assessment at diagnosis and therapeutic approach combining nutritional support and and adapted physical activity (APA) in addition to anticancer treatments should be systematically implemented in patients with advanced GI cancers.\n\nThis type of intervention complies with the standards recommended by the National Cancer Institute (INCa) to promote the practice of physical activity during and after treatment in oncology.",

Chemotherapy drugs, such as cabazitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as niraparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cetrelimab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving niraparib with or without cetrelimab, after treatment with cabazitaxel, carboplatin, and cetrelimab, may help control aggressive variant prostate cancer.",

      "detailed_description": "This research study is designed to explore if a new radiotherapeutic (radioactive) drug, named 212Pb (212-lead) VMT-α-NET, works against neuroendocrine tumor cells. To begin researching this drug, we need to determine if \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET is safe and tolerable when used as a cancer treatment. As a safety study, it is unknown if the treatment is safe or effective.\n\nThe study will also estimate the radiation dose to the kidneys for this treatment. To calculate this radiation dose, imaging is also performed with the sister drug, \\[203Pb\\] VMT-α-NET using SPECT/CT imaging. Each participant is assigned a radiation dose to the kidneys that cannot be exceeded. The study is testing the safety of the specific radiation dose to the kidneys when using \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET.\n\nParticipants are assigned a radiation dose based on how other participants have tolerated the \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET. The amount of \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET administered varies person-to-person because of each person's unique tumor uptake of \\[203Pb\\] VMT-α-NET and how long it lasts in the body.\n\nThe study involves 2 treatments, about 8 to 10 weeks apart. The drug is given by infusion once per treatment. The participants also receive an infusion of amino acids to help protect the kidneys as well as medications to help protect against nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).\n\nOnce a participant is administered the \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET, they must be followed (i.e. come back to the clinic) for at least 6 months for safety assessments. Safety assessments include blood tests to check bone marrow, kidney, and liver function as well as urinary tests to check kidney function. Participants will also have imaging at 6 months post-treatment to measure how their tumors responded to therapy.\n\nParticipants will have lifelong follow-up for this study.",

The purpose of this study is to find out whether capecitabine and temozolomide or lutetium Lu 177 dotatate may kill more tumor cells in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nThe primary and secondary objectives of the study:\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the differences in median progression-free survival (PFS) for lutetium Lu 177 dotatate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) when compared to capecitabine and temozolomide (CAPTEM) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate and compare the overall survival (OS) of patients receiving lutetium Lu 177 dotatate versus (vs.) CAPTEM.\n\nII. To evaluate and compare time to response, time to maximum response, and overall response rates (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 between both arms.\n\nIII. To evaluate and compare duration of response and time to progression among both arms.\n\nIV. To evaluate and compare treatment related toxicities between the arms. V. To compare global health status/quality of life as measured with the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-C30 from baseline through 18 months between patients with pNET treated with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate PRRT versus capecitabine and temozolomide.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM II: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) days 1-14 and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 10-14.

      "condition": "Neuroendocrine Tumor, Malignant; Neuroendocrine Tumor Gastrointestinal, Hormone-Secreting",
      "intervention": "90Y-DOTA-3-Tyr-Octreotide; 131I-MIBG",
      "brief_summary": "This study is designed to identify the best tolerated doses of \\[131\\]Iodine-MIBG and \\[90\\]Yttrium-DOTATOC when co-administered to treat midgut neuroendocrine tumors. These drugs (131I-MIBG, 90Y-DOTATOC) are radioactive drugs, known as radionuclide therapy. Currently, the safest and best tolerated doses of these drugs (when combined together) is unknown.",
      "detailed_description": "\\[131\\]Iodine-MIBG and \\[90\\]Yttrium-DOTATOC are radioactive drugs designed to treat specific tumor cells. These drugs are a combination of the radiation (131-Iodine, 90-Yttrium) and a protein that targets the tumor cell (MIBG or DOTATOC). Because these proteins are attracted to, and stick to, the tumor, the radiation is centered in the tumors. This kills more tumor cells and minimizes radiation-damage to healthy tissues, like the heart and lungs.\n\nTwo organs still absorb some of the radiation, though: bone marrow and the kidney. These organs limit how much radiation can be given to tumors, but we don't know how much radiation is too much. Too much radiation to bone marrow can result in anemia. Too much radiation to the kidneys can result in kidney failure. From prior radiation therapies, we have a general idea of how much radiation we can give safely.\n\n131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC have never been given together. We want to give them together because many times, tumors are actually groups of different types of cells. This means, not all the cells respond to therapy the same way. If some tumor cells survive therapy, the tumor will continue to grow and eventually come back. We know some mid-gut neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have targets for DOTATOC and some other mid-gut NETs have targets for MIBG. We also have now identified that some people with mid-gut NETs have different tumors: some with targets for MIBG and some with targets for DOTATOC. For these people, this means treating only with 131I-MIBG or 90Y-DOTATOC will not be enough to treat their cancer. They need both radioactive drugs.\n\nBecause we are combining these radioactive drugs, this study is known as a first-in-man study. We are also using a special imaging to help us estimate the radiation dose to the bone marrow and to the kidneys. This is what decides the final dose of 131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC.\n\nBefore receiving therapy, participants will be asked to undergo imaging to verify they have both MIBG and DOTATOC tumor types:\n\n* participants are given very small doses of radioactive drugs\n* a special camera (SPECT/CT) collects images (scans)\n* imaging (scans) are done over 3 calendar days\n* blood samples are taken at that time, too, to measure the circulating amount of tracer doses\n\nIf the scans show a participant has both MIBG and DOTATOC tumors, therapy is given:\n\n* a customized dose of 90Y-DOTATOC is given on day 1 of a treatment cycle. This is given outpatient.\n* a customized dose of 131I-MIBG is given on day 2 of a treatment cycle. This is given inpatient (admitted to the hospital).\n* participants are monitored through blood tests to identify the side effects of therapy.\n\nEach participant can have up to 2 cycles of therapy. The cycles are 12 weeks apart.\n\nThe doses for 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I-MIBG are decided based on radiation to the bone marrow and radiation to the kidney. Doses are decided by how well other participants have done on this study.\n\nParticipants have life long follow-up for this study. This is very important, because a study like this has not been done.",

      "brief_summary": "This pilot phase II trial studies how effective pembrolizumab and liver-directed therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are at treating patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or progressive tumors that have spread to the liver (liver metastases). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Liver-directed therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial embolization, yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization, and cryoablation may help activate the immune system in order to shrink tumors that are not being directly targeted. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is a form of targeted treatment that is performed by the use of a small molecule, which carries a radioactive component attached to a peptide. Once injected into the body, this small molecule binds to some specific sites on tumor cells called receptors and emit medium energy radiation that can destroy cells. Because this radionuclide is attached to the peptide, which binds receptors on tumor lesions, the radiation can preferably be targeted to the tumor cells in order to destroy them. Giving pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy may work better than pembrolizumab alone.",

Erdafitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving erdafitinib may help control disease in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS\n\nBackground\n\nNeuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that can arise at any site in the gastrointestinal tract, that are known by their ability to over express somatostatin receptors. Originally called carcinoid tumours, these tumours are rising in incidence. In patients with incurable disease, several systemic options have demonstrated activity but few have been compared in prospective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs). 177Lu-Octreotate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and CAPTEM have shown promising activity in initial single arm trials. Prospective RCTs are needed to build on these early trials to determine the optimal role of these therapies in clinical practice.\n\nCONTROL NETs is a parallel group phase II randomised open label trial of Lutetium-177 Octreotate (177Lu-Octreotate (Lutate)) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and capecitabine (CAP)/temozolomide (TEM) chemotherapy (chemotherapy): (i) versus CAPTEM alone in the treatment of low to intermediate grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs); (ii) versus PRRT alone in the treatment of low to intermediate grade midgut neuroendocrine tumours (mNETs).\n\nGeneral aim\n\ni) To determine the relative activity of CAPTEM/PRRT in biopsy-proven, low to intermediate grade, unresectable, metastatic 68Ga-octreotate PET-avid NETs in the following parallel phase II studies: Group A: pNETs and Group B: mNETs.\n\nii) To inform future comparative phase III RCTs to determine the optimal therapies in pNETs and mNETs.\n\nDesign\n\nTwo parallel non-comparative group randomised, controlled, multi-centre phase II, 2 arm open-label controlled trials with 2:1 allocation (experimental : control)\n\n1. Study A: pNETs: PRRT/CAPTEM vs. CAPTEM (control)\n2. Study B: mNETs: PRRT/CAPTEM vs. PRRT (control)\n\nRandomisation will be performed using the method of minimisation.\n\nPatients will be stratified by:\n\n* Previous systemic therapy regimens (0,1 v 2)\n* WHO tumour grade: Low Grade - G1 (Ki67\\<3% (mitotic count \\<2)) vs. Intermediate Grade - G2 (Ki67 3-20% (mitotic count 2-20))\n* visceral only vs. visceral with bone metastases\n* Treating institution\n\nPopulation\n\nThe target population for this study is consenting adult patients with advanced, unresectable low or intermediate grade (Ki-67\\<20%) midgut neuroendocrine tumours (mNETs) or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs ), who have received ≤ 2 prior systemic therapies for advanced unresectable disease (including long acting somatostatin analogues).\n\nAssessments\n\n* Patients will be assessed at each treatment cycle for toxicity\n* CT including a 3 phase contrast CT of the liver will be undertaken at baseline, then every 2 months (pNET) or every 4 months (pNET) until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1.\n* 68Ga-DOTATATE PET CT Scan will be undertaken at baseline, then every 4 months until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1.\n* 18F-FDG PET Scan may be performed at the discretion of treating clinician at baseline, then every 2 months until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1) for G2 NETS.\n* 24-h whole-body planar gamma imaging will be undertaken on the day after administration of PRRT (every 2 months).\n* Serum biomarkers will be undertaken every 4 months until disease progression.\n* Quality of life assessments will be undertaken at every 2 months until disease progression using QLC C30 and QLQ-GINET21.\n* Health utilities will be evaluated with EQ-5D-5L every 2 months until completion of study follow up.\n\nStatistical considerations\n\nBoth studies are based on a Simon's two-stage design and are randomised using a 2:1 randomisation (Experimental: Control). A mix of approximately 30% G1 patients and 70% G2 patients is expected.\n\nStudy A, pNETs (n=90) will have 80% power with 95% confidence interval to exclude a 12 months PFS of 60% in favour of a more interesting rate of 77% in the experimental arm.\n\nFor Study B, mNETs (n=75), the PFS at 24 months in the control arm is expected to be 52%. Thus study B will have 80% power with 95% confidence interval to demonstrate a PFS rate at 24 months of 70% in experimental arm, a result that would warrant further investigation.\n\nA total sample size of 165 patients for the two studies will be accrued over 2 years.\n\nPatients will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial investigates how well oral cryotherapy plus acupressure and acupuncture compared with oral cryotherapy alone work in decreasing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with gastrointestinal cancer who are receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Acupressure is the application of pressure or localized massage to specific sites on the body to control symptoms such as pain or nausea. Acupuncture is the technique of inserting thin needles through the skin at specific points on the body to control pain and other symptoms. Cryotherapy uses cold temperature such as oral ice chips to prevent abnormally increased pain sensation. Giving oral cryotherapy with acupressure and acupuncture may work better in decreasing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy from oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with gastrointestinal cancer compared to oral cryotherapy alone.",
      "detailed_description": "OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients undergo acupuncture during chemotherapy infusion on day 1 and fluorouracil pump disconnect on day 3 of each biweekly chemotherapy infusion over 12 weeks. Patients also undergo self-administered acupressure over 11 minutes daily for 12 weeks and undergo standard of care oral cryotherapy.\n\nARM II: Patients undergo standard of care oral cryotherapy.",
