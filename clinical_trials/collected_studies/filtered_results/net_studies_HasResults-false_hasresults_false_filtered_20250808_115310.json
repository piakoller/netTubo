Although immunotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of many cancers, its role in NENs remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of avelumab, a PD-L1-directed antibody, in patients with advanced unresectable/metastatic higher grade NENs. Methods: NET001 and NET002 are phase II studies investigating avelumab ( NCT03278405 and NCT03278379 ). Eligible patients had unresectable and/or metastatic WHO G2-3 NENs from a gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) source or a bronchial primary (excluding typical carcinoid) and 0-2 prior lines of systemic therapy (excluding SSAs). Patients were treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks for 26 cycles. NET001 investigated G3 poorly differentiated GEP neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) and bronchial small/large cell NEC, whereas NET002 investigated G2-3 well-differentiated GEPNETs and bronchial atypical carcinoids. The primary endpoint in both trials was overall response rate (ORR) by RECIST v1.1; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, disease control rate at six months and toxicity. Results: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled (21 GEP, 6 lung; 10 in NET-001, 17 in NET-002); median age 64 (range 37-80), 30% ECOG PS 1-2 and 78% received 1+ lines of prior therapy. The median Ki-67 index was 35% (range 10-100). Twelve of the twenty-seven patients had died at the time of data lock. The median time on treatment was 85 days (seven cycles). No objective responses were observed. Stable disease was achieved in 33% of patients, and the disease control rate at 6 mo was 21%. The median PFS was 3.3 months (range 1.2-24.6), and the median OS was 14.2 months. Treatment-related adverse events (all grades) occurred in 58% of patients. Three patients had treatment-related grade 3-4 AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (immune-related hepatitis n = 2 and infusion-related reaction n = 1). Conclusion: Single-agent PD-L1 blockade with avelumab showed limited antitumour activity in patients with G2-3 NENs. Correlative studies are underway. Further studies are needed to explore the role of dual immunotherapy and other combinations in this population with few treatment alternatives.

      "detailed_description": "This is a master observational trial (MOT). Anyone who has been diagnosed with advanced cancer is eligible as long as they are a candidate for treatment. Each patient will receive testing and treatment as determined by patient in consultation with physician. ROOT will proceed in two directions: (1) Validation Cohorts. These patients will demonstrate the ability of the MOT to prospectively collect data using the same protocol and related documents, standardized data elements and processes, and accepted scientific endpoints; and (2) Analysis Cohorts. The modular nature of the study allows collection of RWD ranging from diagnosis only to the full treatment course of the of the patient. Patients are grouped to allow focused data collection or a specific analysis. Analysis cohorts can be created from patients already enrolled in ROOT or be defined prospectively. Because of the ongoing advancements of molecular based oncology, this trial allows a detailed focus on molecular testing as part of any cohort.\n\nData is reported by the group that is most qualified to provide this information and is proved, at point of care, using standardized data elements and processes. Physicians will report diagnosis, molecular characteristics, staging, disease burden, significant comorbidities, treatment response, and medical decision making. Molecular testing (reports and details) will be requested from testing laboratories. Any diagnostic films will be received digitally from the location the study was performed. Research staff assist in data entry and providing physicians needed data as part of the regular workflow to allow point-of-care reporting.\n\nThe Validation Cohorts and Analysis Cohorts may run sequentially or in parallel with each other.",

Methods: In this prospective, non-interventional study ( NCT02730104 ), adult patients with locally advanced (inoperable), metastatic GEP-NETs treated with lanreotide depot were evaluated by their physician every 6 months from enrollment for 24 months. Clinically defined time to disease progression (TTDP) and overall survival (OS) were estimated for the total population and by primary tumor type (gastrointestinal [GI], pancreatic, unknown origin), and an exploratory analysis determined the rate of progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 and 24 months. Patient satisfaction was evaluated via the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9), and safety information was recorded. Results: Of 99 patients, the 24-month PFS rate was 73.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 63.1-81.7) and 24-month OS rate was 84.2% (95% CI 74.0-90.7). Median TTDP was not reached because few patients experienced disease progression during the study period. The majority of responding patients expressed satisfaction with treatment on each domain of the TSQM-9. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 19.2% of patients, while no serious AEs (SAEs) were related to the study drug. Conclusions: Lanreotide depot is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for GEP-NETs in the real-world community setting. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT02730104 . Keywords: GEP-NETs; Lanreotide depot; Neuroendocrine tumors; Oncology; Patient satisfaction; Progression-free survival; Prospective study; Real-world evidence. Plain language summary Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are rare tumors that develop in the gut or pancreas. GEP-NETs may lead to a reduced lifespan, and people with GEP-NETs may have symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, diarrhea, stomach pain/cramping, and skin reactions. One approved treatment for patients whose tumor cannot be removed with surgery is lanreotide depot. Clinical trials have found lanreotide depot to be effective at prolonging survival and managing symptoms in people with GEP-NETs. However, clinical trials take place under very strict conditions and often do not represent all people with a certain disease in the ‘real world’. It is important to determine whether treatments are still effective when used outside of clinical trials. This study was conducted in the real world and followed 99 people with GEP-NETs whose physicians were treating them with lanreotide depot. Each person was monitored for 24 months and assessed during check-ups by their physician every 6 months. After 24 months, 73.7% of people did not have progression (worsening) of disease. The percentage of people who had not died by the end of the study was 84.2%. Most patients (91.6%) said they were satisfied with their treatment. Only 19.2% of patients experienced side effects, none of which were serious. © 2022. The Author(s).

      "brief_summary": "Background Treatment and control of cancer is associated with high costs, to patients in the form of side effects and discomfort during investigations, to society in the form of expensive drugs and studies.\n\nCirculating tumor cells (CTC) has received great attention as a cancer biomarker in trying to estimate future course in patients with breast cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer. CTC is believed to be a crucial step in cancer spreading to the bloodstream and giving rise to metastases. Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) specifically adds specificity to the analysis of the CTC.\n\nThe investigators would like to with molecular biological methods predict which patients requires special monitoring and individualized therapy and explore these tests as clinical decision support.\n\nPurpose and method\n\nIn a blood sample from patients with neuro-endocrine tumor (NET) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the investigators will by cell separation, flow cytometry and DNA sequencing and digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR):\n\n1. Identify and isolate the CTC and investigate these for tumor-specific mutations.\n2. Quantify ctDNA and analyze this for specific mutations, which in the past has been found frequent in NET and HCC.\n3. Compare findings of mutations on CTC and ctDNA with mutations in tissue biopsies.\n\nThe results are compared with the clinical data on disease course, including the effect of treatment and survival.\n\nSubjects 40 Patients with small intestinal/unknown primary NET before treatment with somatostatin analogues 30 patients with pancreatic NET before treatment with Everolimus 30 patients with presumed radically treated HCC 30 patients with HCC in treatment with Sorafenib A blood sample will be taken prior to the start of treatment, after 1 month after start of treatment and thereafter every 3.-6. month for up to two years.\n\nPerspectives In several cancer types molecular diagnostics have had significant influence in treatment and control strategy. The goal is in future to be able to take advantage of a so-called \"liquid biopsy\" as clinical decision support. The study will bring new knowledge to this growing field of research.",

      "detailed_description": "Standard surgical procedures for benign or low-grade malignant pancreatic tumors is associated with increased risks of postoperative complications and long-term pancreatic functional impairment, while parenchyma-sparing pancreatectomy such as enucleation can reduce the incidence of complications and preserve healthy parenchyma, thereby preserve both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function. It has been reported that pancreatic tumor enucleation is a safe and feasible approach in preserving normal physiological function in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery.\n\nWith the growing emphasis on routine screenings and the application of high-quality thin-slice imaging techniques, the detection rates of pancreatic tumors have witnessed a steady increase. Additionally, there is a notable trend towards younger patients being diagnosed with pancreatic tumors. Consequently, in conjunction with ensuring safe and thorough tumor resection while maximizing preservation of pancreatic function, there is a current clinical demand to further reduce surgical trauma.\n\nLiterature reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that minimally invasive enucleation procedures offer well-known advantages associated with minimally invasive approaches, such as shorter postoperative hospital stays and lower overall complication rates. While the occurrence rate of severe complications, such as postoperative hemorrhage, remains relatively low, the development of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) continues to pose a challenging issue.\n\nThe distance between the tumor and the main pancreatic duct (MPD) is considered a crucial factor influencing the occurrence of POPF after enucleation. However, these data have been rarely described in previous studies, making it challenging to accurately assess their actual impact on the rate of POPF occurrence. Heeger et al. suggested that the risk of POPF increases with closer proximity of the tumor to the MPD. The incidence of POPF was higher in deep-seated tumors after pancreatic enucleation (distance to MPD \\<3 mm) compared to superficial tumors (\\>3 mm) (73.3% vs. 30.0%, P=0.002). Other studies have even limited this critical distance to 2mm. Some research has indicated that if the tumor invades or encases the MPD, enucleation surgery should be contraindicated, and standard resection should be preferred to avoid the risk of POPF postoperatively. However, a retrospective analysis by Strobel et al. on 166 cases of pancreatic tumor enucleation demonstrated that even tumors in close proximity to the MPD can be safely resected, although their study did not include cases with tumor encasement of the MPD.\n\nDuring the expansive growth of solid tumors such as neuroendocrine tumors and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, they can compress the MPD, causing inflammatory adhesions. Cystic tumors can also surround the MPD as they grow. Enucleation of these tumors may inevitably lead to exposure, injury, or transection of the MPD, necessitating repair and reconstruction. Recent years have seen successful cases reported of end-to-end anastomosis of the MPD. Minimally invasive techniques have also facilitated the promotion of MPD repair or bridging reconstruction surgeries. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive research data in this field.\n\nThe safety and feasibility of minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation procedures involving MPD exposure, repair, or reconstruction, the control of POPF, and the long-term prognosis and quality of life of patients after MPD repair or reconstruction remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a prospective cohort study. The results of this study will serve as a valuable reference for clinical practice and promote the development and application of minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation procedures.",

Lutetium [ 177 Lu]-DOTA-TATE was approved for the treatment of GEP-NETs after the phase III NETTER 1trial demonstrated improved progression free survival, objective response rates and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) compared to high-dose somatostatin analogues. No real-world data exist on prescribing habits and clinically significant endpoints for [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE treatment in Italy. REAL-LU is a multicentre, long-term observational study in patients with unresectable/metastatic GEP-NETs progressing on standard therapies in Italian clinical practice. A pre-specified interim analysis was performed at the end of the enrolment period, data from which are described herein. Methods: Overall duration of REAL-LU will be approximately 48 months, with 12- and 36-month recruitment and follow-up periods, respectively. The primary objective is to evaluate [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE effectiveness in terms of progression-free survival. Secondary objectives include safety, impact on HRQoL, and identification of prognostic factors. This pre-specified interim analysis describes patient profiles, at the end of enrollment, of those prescribed [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE for GEP-NETs in Italy. Results: Among 161 evaluable patients, mean age was 64.7 ± 10.3 years at study entry, 83.8% presented with no clinical signs of disease at physical examination, and most had minor disease symptoms. All patients had metastatic disease, most commonly in the liver (83.9%) with a median of two metastatic sites. In 90.7% of patients, the disease was stage IV, and 68.3% had ≥ 1 target lesion. [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE was prescribed mainly as second-line therapy (61.6%) and following surgery (58.4%). HRQoL assessments revealed high levels of functioning and low levels of symptoms at baseline; 50.0% of patients were symptom-free at study entry. Conclusion: The characteristics of patients who received [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE in Italy are similar to those of the GEP-NET population of NETTER 1 with trial but with a higher proportion of patients with a grade 2 (71%). With regard to the tumor grade profile, our study cohort appears to be closer to that of NETTER-2 study population which included patients with G2 or G3 advanced GEP-NETs (i.e. Ki-67 ≥ 10% and ≤ 55%). Further analysis of effectiveness and safety can be anticipated as REAL-LU data mature.

With the increasing adoption of MIEN, there is an urgent need for a predictive model to guide the treatment and prognosis of POPF. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a cohort study, with data prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The result of this study will provide a valuable reference for the development and application of MIEN.",

      "brief_summary": "Background: Liver metastases are common in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms, but often underestimated by preoperative imaging. Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) is the reference standard for staging of primary and metastatic liver tumors, with a diagnostic accuracy superior to that of CT and MRI. Rationale: The present study aims to evaluate the contribution of IOUS to staging of liver disease in patients with neuroendocrine tumor candidates for primary tumor resection classified as cM0 at preoperative imaging.\n\nThe study will collect a prospective series of 99 patients undegoing surgery for gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at the Humanitas Clinical Institute (coordinating centre) or at one of the participating centres in the period 2020-2023. All patients had to be cM0 tumor at preoperative imaging. Additional inclusion criteria: age\\>18 years, ability to give the informed consent for study participation; no other malignancies in the previous 5 years; preoperative staging including abdominal CT and DOTATOC PET-CT performed ≤60 days before surgery.\n\nThis prospective observational multicentre study aims to elucidate the proportion of patients with gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cM0 at preoperative imaging that have intraoperative detection of liver metastases at IOUS.\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n- Performances of IOUS in identifying liver metastases in patients with neuroendocrine tumor classified as cM0 at preoperative imaging\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n* Impact of IOUS on the therapeutic strategy\n* Performances of preoperative imaging (CT, MRI and PET-CT) in comparison with those of IOUS\n\nThe study will collect a prospective series of 99 patients undergoing surgery for gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at the Humanitas Clinical Institute (coordinating centre) or at one of the participating centres in the period 2020-2023.\n\nThe study includes the following steps:\n\nPreoperative / enrollment: All patients candidates to resection of gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor will be considered for the study. Only cM0 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study must have performed a preoperative abdominal CT scan with contrast medium and a DOTATOC-PET-CT (both performed ≤60 days before surgery).\n\nIntraoperative: During surgery, the investigator will perform, as standard in our clinical practice, an accurate exploration of the liver by inspection, palpation and IOUS. The investigator will record the identification of any liver lesion. If one or more nodules suspect of being neuroendocrine liver metastases are identified, it will be necessary, whenever possible, as already routinely performed, to carry out a biopsy or to remove it (if superficial) for histological confirmation of the diagnosis. After completion of liver staging, the primary tumor will be resected.\n\nPostoperative / follow-up: Enrolled patients will have standard postoperative management.\n\nStandard statistical analyses will be performed. Per-patient and per-lesion analyses will be performed to asses performances of preoperative imaging modalities (CT, MRI, PET-CT) and of intraoperative ones (inspection, palpation, and IOUS).",

A total of 30 GEP-NENs patients who received [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE therapy were recruited in the study. We measured the external dose rate (EDR) values of each patient during the injection and 0-6 h post-administration period, as well as the radiation dose (RD) values to healthcare nurses and the surrounding environment. We performed a double exponential curve fitting and estimated the RD to the public from patients discharged at different times after [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE therapy. Results: Among the 30 patients, 27 patients completed 4 cycles of [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE treatments, the estimated RD to the public indicated that for adult family members, children above 10 years old, children aged 3-10 and coworkers of the patients, patients could begin daily contact at least 24 h, 48 h, 144 h and 192 h after injection to ensure that the total RD values after four treatments not exceed the limit. During the hospitalization of patients receiving [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE, the cumulative dose received by the administering nurses and to the ward environment were both well below the national RD limits. Conclusions: This study conducted a fitting analysis of the decay pattern of EDR values in GEP-NENs patients undergoing [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE therapy, in order to establish guidelines for patient discharge timing and provide recommendations for radiation protection for the general public after patient discharge.

Appropriate information may improve their adherence to treatment and quality of life. Objective: To evaluate the change in patient's perceptions of the level of information at lanreotide (LAN) treatment initiation for GEP-NETs vs after 6 months. Design: OPERA ( NCT03562091 ) was a prospective, longitudinal, noninterventional study. Setting: Thirty-one centers in France specialized in the management of patients with NETs. Intervention: Planned clinical visits at enrollment and end-of-study visits at month 6, with completion of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 25-item Quality of Life Questionnaire-Information Module (QLQ-INFO25) and 30-item Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core. Main outcome: Absolute change in the patient's perception of the information between baseline and month 6, using the relevant domains of the QLQ-INFO25. Endpoints measured at baseline and month 6 for at least 1 of the 3 targeted QLQ-INFO25 dimensions of the primary endpoint. Results: Ninety-three of the 115 patients enrolled completed ≥1 primary endpoint information dimension. Mean (SD) scores for the primary endpoint information dimensions were high at baseline (disease, 63.41 [20.71]; treatment, 58.85 [19.00]; supportive care, 26.53 [24.69]; maximum 100). There were no significant changes between baseline (98.34% CI) and 6 months (disease, -2.84 [-8.69, 3.01; P = .24]; treatment, -4.37 [-11.26, 2.52; P = .13]; supportive care, 0.46 [-6.78, 7.70; P = .88]), and in HRQoL between baseline and 6 months. Conclusions and relevance: The lack of change in patient's perceptions of the disease, treatment, and supportive care information provided over the first 6 months of LAN treatment may suggest that physicians provided adequate information at the treatment initiation.

Eligible patients who have provided their written informed consent for study participation will be assigned to one of 7 cohorts determined by indication:\n\n* Cohort 1: Rare sarcoma\n* Cohort 2: Rare ovarian cancer\n* Cohort 3: Primary central nervous system lymphomas\n* Cohort 4: Rare thyroid cancer\n* Cohort 5: Rare malignant neuroendocrine cancer\n* Cohort 6: Germ-cell cancer\n* Cohort 7: NK/T-cell lymphoma\n\nBetween 20 and 50 patients will be enrolled in each cohort with the exception of the cohort 1 for which up to 80 patients may be enrolled (extension introduced under amendment 5 of this protocol). Following the amendment 6, up to a maximum of 50 additional patients may be included in the Sarcoma (cohort 1), Rare ovarian cancer (cohort 2) or Primary central nervous system lymphoma (cohort 3) cohorts, within the limit of 350 patients to be included in total.\n\nThe study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.\n\nAll participants who reach the maximum treatment duration per protocol and stop the pembrolizumab with a clinical benefit (prolonged stable disease, partial or complete response), may be eligible for up to an additional 1 year (approximately 17 cycles) of pembrolizumab treatment if they progress during the follow-up period.

Abstract Background: Sarcoma is a heterogeneous group of diseases with few treatment options. Immunotherapy has shown little activity in studies including unselected sarcomas, but immune checkpoint blockers have shown activity in specific histotypes. We evaluated the activity of pembrolizumab in rare and ultra-rare sarcomas. Methods: AcSé Pembrolizumab is an ongoing phase 2, basket, multitumour study investigating the activity of pembrolizumab monotherapy in rare cancers. Here, we report the results obtained in patients with selected histotypes of rare sarcomas (incidence of less than one case per 1 000 000 people per year) recruited at 24 French hospitals. Key inclusion criteria were age 15 years or older, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and advanced disease that was untreated and resistant to treatment. Patients were given pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously on day 1 of every 21-day cycle for a maximum of 24 months. The primary endpoint was objective response rate at week 12 using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, assessed by local investigators. The primary endpoint and safety were analysed in the intention-to-treat population. The AcSé Pembrolizumab study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03012620 . Findings: Between Sept 4, 2017, and Dec 29, 2020, 98 patients were enrolled, of whom 97 received treatment and were included in analyses (median age 51 years [IQR 35-65]; 53 [55%] were male; 44 [45%] were female; no data were collected on race or ethnicity). 34 (35%) patients had chordomas, 14 (14%) had alveolar soft part sarcomas, 12 (12%) had SMARCA4-deficient sarcomas or malignant rhabdoid tumours, eight (8%) had desmoplastic small round cell tumours, six (6%) had epithelioid sarcomas, four (4%) had dendritic cell sarcomas, three (3%) each had clear cell sarcomas, solitary fibrous tumours, and myxoid liposarcomas, and ten (10%) had other ultra-rare histotypes. As of data cutoff (April 11, 2022), median follow-up was 13·1 months (range 0·1-52·8; IQR 4·3-19·7). At week 12, objective response rate was 6·2% (95% CI 2·3-13·0), with no complete responses and six partial responses in the 97 patients. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were anaemia (eight [8%] of 97), alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase increase (six [6%]), and dyspnoea (five [5%]). 86 serious adverse events were reported in 37 patients. Five deaths due to adverse events were reported, none of which were determined to be related to treatment (two due to disease progression, two due to cancer, and one due to unknown cause). Interpretation: Our data show the activity and manageable toxicity of pembrolizumab in some rare and ultra-rare sarcoma histotypes, and support the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway as a potential therapeutic target in selected histotypes. The completion of the basket study will provide further evidence regarding the activity and toxicity of pembrolizumab in identified rare types of cancer.

      "detailed_description": "Biomarker-based tools that can accurately predict gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) treatment response and tumor recurrence are currently not available. Circulating biomarkers that are associated with GEP-NETs are limited to measurements of plasma chromogranin A (CgA). The investigators have developed a PCR-based tool to quantitate (score) the circulating GEP-NET molecular signature (\"liquid\" biopsy) with high sensitivity and specificity. This signature can identify all types of GEP-NETs including small (1cm) non-metastatic tumors, is significantly reduced after tumor debulking and is decreased following surgical \"cure\". Elevated post-surgical scores are associated with tumor recurrence within 6 months in \\~40% of cases. Current NET treatment protocols are associated with tumor recurrence (progression free survival) ranging from 5-18 months. The majority of patients will experience a relapse within 18 months irrespective of the treatment approach. The investigators hypothesize that a PCR measurement of circulating NET mRNA can accurately predict the extent of surgical resection (tumor removal) and elevated scores can predict tumor relapse before this occurs. This biomarker protocol seeks to test this hypothesis and evaluate whether changes in plasma CgA are as effective in predicting resection and recurrence.",

Patients received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses, and this was followed by 480 mg of nivolumab intravenously every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1). Results: Fifty-five patients were enrolled at 6 institutions between April 2018 and July 2019 in 3 cohorts: BUTCVH (n = 19), adrenal tumors (n = 18), and other tumors (n = 18). The median follow-up was 9.9 months (range, 1 to 21 months). Twenty-eight patients (51%) received 4 doses of nivolumab and ipilimumab; 25 patients received nivolumab maintenance for a median of 4 cycles (range, 1-18 cycles). The ORR for the entire study was 16% (80% confidence interval, 10%-25%); the ORR in the BUTCVH cohort, including 2 complete responses, was 37%, and it was 6% in the other 2 cohorts. Twenty-two patients (40%) developed treatment-related grade 3 or higher toxicities; 24% (n = 13) required high-dose steroids (≥40 mg of prednisone or the equivalent). Grade 5 events occurred in 3 patients; 1 death was treatment related. Conclusions: Nivolumab and ipilimumab resulted in objective responses in a subset of patients with rare genitourinary malignancies, especially those with BUTCVH. An additional cohort exploring their activity in genitourinary tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation is ongoing. Lay summary: Patients with rare cancers are often excluded from studies and have limited treatment options. Fifty-five patients with rare tumors of the genitourinary system were enrolled from multiple sites and were treated with nivolumab and ipilimumab, a regimen used for kidney cancer. The regimen showed activity in some patients, particularly those with bladder or upper tract cancers of unusual or variant histology; 37% of those patients responded to therapy. Additional studies are ongoing to better determine who benefits the most from this combination.

This matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) evaluated differences in efficacy and safety across larotrectinib and entrectinib trials. Data from clinical trials for larotrectinib (LOXO-TRK-14001 ( NCT02122913 ), SCOUT ( NCT02637687 ), and NAVIGATE ( NCT02576431 )) and entrectinib (ALKA-372-001 (EudraCT 2012-000148-88), STARTRK-1 ( NCT02097810 ), and STARTRK-2 ( NCT02568267 )) were used. Adults (≥18 years) across trials were matched on available baseline characteristics. Outcomes evaluated included overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), any serious treatment-related adverse events of grade ≥ 3 (TRAEs), and TRAEs leading to treatment discontinuation. The MAIC included 74 patients from entrectinib trials and 117 and 147 patients for the larotrectinib efficacy and safety populations, respectively. Post-matching, larotrectinib was associated with a significantly longer median duration of OS than entrectinib (p < 0.05) and a numerically longer median PFS (p = 0.07). ORR was similar for both agents (p = 0.63). The CR rate was higher (p < 0.05) and the DoR was longer for larotrectinib (p < 0.05). Safety outcomes were comparable and low for both treatments. Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses. These findings suggest favorable efficacy for larotrectinib and comparable safety profiles versus entrectinib in treating tropomyosin receptor kinase fusion cancer.

Approximately 40 % of patients with advanced NSCLC develop CNS metastases; therefore, treatments with intracranial (IC) efficacy are needed. In an integrated analysis of three phase I/II studies (ALKA-372-001: EudraCT 2012-000148-88; STARTRK-1: NCT02097810 ; STARTRK-2: NCT02568267 ), entrectinib, a potent, CNS-active, TRK inhibitor, demonstrated efficacy in patients with NTRK fusion-positive (fp) NSCLC (objective response rate [ORR]: 64.5 %; 2 August 2021 data cut-off). We present updated data for this cohort. Materials and methods: Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years with locally advanced/metastatic, NTRK-fp NSCLC with ≥ 12 months of follow-up. Tumor responses were assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST v1.1 at Week 4 and every eight weeks thereafter. Co-primary endpoints: ORR; duration of response (DoR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS); overall survival (OS); IC efficacy; safety. Enrolment cut-off: 2 July 2021; data cut-off: 2 August 2022. Results: The efficacy-evaluable population included 51 patients with NTRK-fp NSCLC. Median age was 60.0 years (range 22-88); 20 patients (39.2 %) had investigator-assessed baseline CNS metastases. Median survival follow-up was 26.3 months (95 % CI 21.0-34.1). ORR was 62.7 % (95 % CI 48.1-75.9), with six complete and 26 partial responses. Median DoR and PFS were 27.3 months (95 % CI 19.9-30.9) and 28.0 months (95 % CI 15.7-30.4), respectively. Median OS was 41.5 months. In patients with BICR-assessed baseline CNS metastases, IC-ORR was 64.3 % (n = 9/14; 95 % CI 35.1-87.2), including seven complete responders, and IC-DoR was 55.7 months. In the safety-evaluable population (n = 55), most treatment-related adverse events were grade 1/2; no treatment-related deaths were reported. Conclusion: Entrectinib has continued to demonstrate deep and durable systemic and IC responses in patients with NTRK-fp NSCLC. Keywords: CNS; Entrectinib; Intracranial; NSCLC; NTRK fusions.

Abstract Aim: Generating direct comparative evidence in prospective randomized trials is difficult for rare diseases. Real-world cohorts may supplement control populations. Methods: Entrectinib-treated adults with advanced ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC (n = 94) from Phase I/II trials (ALKA-372-001 [EudraCT2012-00148-88], STARTRK-1 [ NCT02097810 ], and STARTRK-2 [ NCT02568267 ]) were compared with a real-world crizotinib-treated cohort (n = 65). Primary end point, time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD); secondary end points, PFS and OS. Results: Median (95% CI) weighted TTD: 12.9 (9.9-17.4) months for entrectinib; 8.8 (6.2-9.9) months for crizotinib (weighted hazard ratio: 0.72 [0.51-1.02]). Median OS with entrectinib was not reached, weighted median OS with crizotinib was 18.5 (15.1-19.9) months. Conclusion: Entrectinib administered in clinical trials may be associated with longer TTD than a real-world crizotinib population.

Abstract Neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusions are rare oncogenic drivers in solid tumours. This study aimed to interrogate a large real-world database of comprehensive genomic profiling data to describe the genomic landscape and prevalence of NTRK gene fusions. NTRK fusion-positive tumours were identified from the FoundationCORE ® database of >295,000 cancer patients. We investigated the prevalence and concomitant genomic landscape of NTRK fusions, predicted patient ancestry and compared the FoundationCORE cohort with entrectinib clinical trial cohorts (ALKA-372-001 [EudraCT 2012-000148-88]; STARTRK-1 [ NCT02097810 ]; STARTRK-2 [ NCT02568267 ]). Overall NTRK fusion-positive tumour prevalence was 0.30% among 45 cancers with 88 unique fusion partner pairs, of which 66% were previously unreported. Across all cases, prevalence was 0.28% and 1.34% in patients aged ≥18 and <18 years, respectively; prevalence was highest in patients <5 years (2.28%). The highest prevalence of NTRK fusions was observed in salivary gland tumours (2.62%). Presence of NTRK gene fusions did not correlate with other clinically actionable biomarkers; there was no co-occurrence with known oncogenic drivers in breast, or colorectal cancer (CRC). However, in CRC, NTRK fusion-positivity was associated with spontaneous microsatellite instability (MSI); in this MSI CRC subset, mutual exclusivity with BRAF mutations was observed. NTRK fusion-positive tumour types had similar frequencies in FoundationCORE and entrectinib clinical trials. NTRK gene fusion prevalence varied greatly by age, cancer type and histology.

We report the results of an updated integrated analysis of three phase I or II clinical trials (ALKA-372-001, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2) of the ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, entrectinib, in ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC. Methods: The efficacy-evaluable population included adults with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC with or without CNS metastases who received entrectinib ≥ 600 mg orally once per day. Co-primary end points were objective response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent central review and duration of response (DoR). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), intracranial ORR, intracranial DoR, intracranial PFS, and safety. Results: In total, 161 patients with a follow-up of ≥ 6 months were evaluable. The median treatment duration was 10.7 months (IQR, 6.4-17.7). The ORR was 67.1% (n = 108, 95% CI, 59.3 to 74.3), and responses were durable (12-month DoR rate, 63%, median DoR 15.7 months). The 12-month PFS rate was 55% (median PFS 15.7 months), and the 12-month OS rate was 81% (median OS not estimable). In 24 patients with measurable baseline CNS metastases by blinded independent central review, the intracranial ORR was 79.2% (n = 19; 95% CI, 57.9 to 92.9), the median intracranial PFS was 12.0 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 19.3), and the median intracranial DoR was 12.9 months (12-month rate, 55%). The safety profile in this updated analysis was similar to that reported in the primary analysis, and no new safety signals were found. Conclusion: Entrectinib continued to demonstrate a high level of clinical benefit for patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC, including patients with CNS metastases.

We present integrated data of entrectinib in children with NTRK or ROS1 fusion-positive tumours from the STARTRK-NG, TAPISTRY, and STARTRK-2 trials. Methods: Efficacy analyses were undertaken on TRK/ROS1 inhibitor-naïve patients aged <18 years with metastatic/locally advanced NTRK1/2/3 or ROS1 fusion-positive extracranial solid or CNS tumours who received ≥1 entrectinib dose and had ≥6 months of follow-up from enrolment. Tumour responses were confirmed by blinded independent central review (BICR) per RECIST v1.1/RANO criteria. Primary endpoint: BICR-assessed confirmed objective response rate (cORR). Key secondary endpoints: duration of response (DoR); time to response (TtR); safety. Results: As of 16 July 2023, out of 91 safety-evaluable patients, 64 (NTRK: n=44; ROS1: n=20) were efficacy evaluable. In the NTRK and ROS1 subgroups, respectively, median age was 4.0 years and 7.5 years; median survival follow-up was 24.2 months and 27.6 months. cORR was 72.7 % (NTRK, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 57.2-85.0) and 65.0 % (ROS1, 95 % CI: 40.8-84.6). Median DoR was not reached (NTRK, 95 % CI: 25.4-not evaluable [NE]); ROS1, 95 % CI: 16.2-NE); median TtR was 1.9 months in both subgroups. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse events included weight gain (35.2 %) and anaemia (31.9 %). Conclusion: Integrated data from three trials confirm entrectinib induces rapid and durable responses in children with NTRK or ROS1 fusion-positive tumours. The increased duration of safety monitoring does not demonstrate new or cumulative toxicity. Registered clinical trials: STARTRK-NG: NCT02650401 ; TAPISTRY: NCT04589845 ; STARTRK-2: NCT02568267 .

Abstract Background: Entrectinib is a potent inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) A, B, and C, which has been shown to have anti-tumour activity against NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumours, including CNS activity due to its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. We present an integrated efficacy and safety analysis of patients with metastatic or locally advanced solid tumours harbouring oncogenic NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 gene fusions treated in three ongoing, early-phase trials. Methods: An integrated database comprised the pivotal datasets of three, ongoing phase 1 or 2 clinical trials (ALKA-372-001, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2), which enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with metastatic or locally advanced NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours who received entrectinib orally at a dose of at least 600 mg once per day in a capsule. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 and could have received previous anti-cancer therapy (except previous TRK inhibitors). The primary endpoints, the proportion of patients with an objective response and median duration of response, were evaluated by blinded independent central review in the efficacy-evaluable population (ie, patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours who were TRK inhibitor-naive and had received at least one dose of entrectinib). Overall safety evaluable population included patients from STARTRK-1, STARTRK-2, ALKA-372-001, and STARTRK-NG ( NCT02650401 ; treating young adult and paediatric patients [aged ≤21 years]), who received at least one dose of entrectinib, regardless of tumour type or gene rearrangement. NTRK fusion-positive safety evaluable population comprised all patients who have received at least one dose of entrectinib regardless of dose or follow-up. These ongoing studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02097810 (STARTRK-1) and NCT02568267 (STARTRK-2), and EudraCT, 2012-000148-88 (ALKA-372-001). Findings: Patients were enrolled in ALKA-372-001 from Oct 26, 2012, to March 27, 2018; in STARTRK-1 from Aug 7, 2014, to May 10, 2018; and in STARTRK-2 from Nov 19, 2015 (enrolment is ongoing). At the data cutoff date for this analysis (May 31, 2018) the efficacy-evaluable population comprised 54 adults with advanced or metastatic NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours comprising ten different tumour types and 19 different histologies. Median follow-up was 12.9 months (IQR 8·77-18·76). 31 (57%; 95% CI 43·2-70·8) of 54 patients had an objective response, of which four (7%) were complete responses and 27 (50%) partial reponses. Median duration of response was 10 months (95% CI 7·1 to not estimable). The most common grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events in both safety populations were increased weight (seven [10%] of 68 patients in the NTRK fusion-positive safety population and in 18 [5%] of 355 patients in the overall safety-evaluable population) and anaemia (8 [12%] and 16 [5%]). The most common serious treatment-related adverse events were nervous system disorders (three [4%] of 68 patients and ten [3%] of 355 patients). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Interpretation: Entrectinib induced durable and clinically meaningful responses in patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours, and was well tolerated with a manageable safety profile. These results show that entrectinib is a safe and active treatment option for patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours. These data highlight the need to routinely test for NTRK fusions to broaden the therapeutic options available for patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumours.

Whether serial targeted gene panel sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) can identify response and progression along with mechanisms of acquired resistance to entrectinib is underexplored. Methods: In patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC, coclinical trial plasma samples were collected before treatment, after two cycles, and after progression on entrectinib (global phase II clinical trial, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02568267 ). Samples underwent cfDNA analysis using MSK-ACCESS. Variant allele frequencies of detectable alterations were correlated with objective response per RECIST v1.1 criteria. Results: Twelve patients were included, with best response as partial response (n = 9, 75%), stable disease (n = 2, 17%), and progressive disease (PD; n = 1, 8%). A ROS1 fusion was variably detected in cfDNA; however, patients without a ROS1 fusion in cfDNA had no other somatic alterations detected, indicative of possible low cfDNA shedding. Clearance of the enrolling ROS1 fusion or concurrent non- ROS1 alterations ( TP53 , CDH1 , NF1 , or ARID1A mutations) was observed in response to entrectinib therapy. Radiologic PD was accompanied by redemonstration of a ROS1 fusion or non- ROS1 alterations. On-target resistance was rare; only one patient acquired ROS1 G2032R at the time of progression. Several patients acquired new off-target likely oncogenic alterations, including a truncating alteration in NF1 . Conclusion: Serial cfDNA monitoring may complement radiographic assessments as determinants of response and resistance to entrectinib in ROS1 fusion-positive lung cancers in addition to detecting putative resistance mechanisms on progression.

Their efficacy has neither been compared directly in clinical trials in patients with ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), nor indirectly in Asian populations. Thus, we aimed to provide comparative evidence of the efficacy and safety of entrectinib and crizotinib for Asian patients with advanced or metastatic ROS1-positive NSCLC. Materials and methods: Efficacy, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), and safety were evaluated using an unanchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). Individual patient data (IPD) from entrectinib trials (ALKA-372-001/EudraCT 2012-000148-88, STARTRK-1/NCT02097810, and STARTRK-2/NCT02568267; dosage, ≥600 mg once daily; enrollment cutoff, 02 July 2020; data cutoff, 02 August 2021) and aggregate data with simulated pseudo-IPD from a crizotinib trial (OxOnc/NCT01945021; dosage, 250 mg twice daily) were analyzed. Key eligibility criteria from the crizotinib trial were applied to IPD from the entrectinib trials. Baseline characteristics were match-adjusted between arms using propensity score weighting. Results: Fifty-two and 127 patients from the entrectinib and crizotinib trials, respectively, were available for evaluation. Median OS was not reached (NR; weighted; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 28.3-NR) in the entrectinib arm and 44.2 months (95 % CI 32.0-NR) in the crizotinib arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.662; 95 % CI 0.32-1.37). The respective median PFS was 39.4 months (weighted; 95 % CI 10.4-46.8) and 15.9 months (95 % CI 12.9-24.0) (HR, 0.688; 95 % CI 0.37-1.27). Most AEs were Grade 1-2; both drugs were generally well tolerated. Neutropenia was the most common Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse event for both entrectinib and crizotinib. Conclusions: The outcomes in this MAIC study including Asian patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC showed a trend for greater clinical benefit with entrectinib versus crizotinib. These findings may contribute to better-informed treatment decisions. Keywords: Asian; Crizotinib; Entrectinib; Matching-adjusted indirect comparison; ROS1-positive non-small cell lung cancer.

PMID: 32615113 No abstract available. Abstract Background: Recurrent gene fusions, such as ROS1 fusions, are oncogenic drivers of various cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Up to 36% of patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC have brain metastases at the diagnosis of advanced disease. Entrectinib is a ROS1 inhibitor that has been designed to effectively penetrate and remain in the CNS. We explored the use of entrectinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC. Methods: We did an integrated analysis of three ongoing phase 1 or 2 trials of entrectinib (ALKA-372-001, STARTRK-1, and STARTRK-2). The efficacy-evaluable population included adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC who received entrectinib at a dose of at least 600 mg orally once per day, with at least 12 months' follow-up. All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and previous cancer treatment (except for ROS1 inhibitors) was allowed. The primary endpoints were the proportion of patients with an objective response (complete or partial response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1) and duration of response, and were evaluated by blinded independent central review. The safety-evaluable population for the safety analysis included all patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC in the three trials who received at least one dose of entrectinib (irrespective of dose or duration of follow-up). These ongoing studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02097810 (STARTRK-1) and NCT02568267 (STARTRK-2), and EudraCT, 2012-000148-88 (ALKA-372-001). Findings: Patients were enrolled in ALKA-372-001 from Oct 26, 2012, to March 27, 2018; in STARTRK-1 from Aug 7, 2014, to May 10, 2018; and in STARTRK-2 from Nov 19, 2015 (enrolment is ongoing). At the data cutoff date for this analysis (May 31, 2018), 41 (77%; 95% CI 64-88) of 53 patients in the efficacy-evaluable population had an objective response. Median follow-up was 15·5 monhts (IQR 13·4-20·2). Median duration of response was 24·6 months (95% CI 11·4-34·8). In the safety-evaluable population, 79 (59%) of 134 patients had grade 1 or 2 treatment-related adverse events. 46 (34%) of 134 patients had grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events, with the most common being weight increase (ten [8%]) and neutropenia (five [4%]). 15 (11%) patients had serious treatment-related adverse events, the most common of which were nervous system disorders (four [3%]) and cardiac disorders (three [2%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred. Interpretation: Entrectinib is active with durable disease control in patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC, and is well tolerated with a manageable safety profile, making it amenable to long-term dosing in these patients. These data highlight the need to routinely test for ROS1 fusions to broaden therapeutic options for patients with ROS1 fusion-positive NSCLC. Funding: Ignyta/F Hoffmann-La Roche.

(C) Best intracranial responses in patients with measurable CNS disease at baseline. According to blinded independent central review, 11 patients were responders. The best response to entrectinib in ROS1 inhibitor-naive patients with ROS1 fusion-positive lung cancers is shown as the maximum percentage improvement in the sum of longest diameters of identified target lesions compared with baseline. At baseline eight patients had lesions of less than 1 cm, which were considered unmeasurable. These eight patients were evaluated as having only non-target lesions and could only have complete responses or progressive disease, therefore results for 45 patients are shown in A and B. All assessments shown were based on blinded independent central review. SLD=sum of longest diameters. Figure 2:. Time-to-event analyses Kaplan–Meier curves of… Figure 2:.

Up to 90% of patients with NETs develop liver metastases, which are a major determinant of symptoms and survival. Current guidelines recommend embolotherapy for progressive or symptomatic NET liver metastases, but the optimal technique among bland embolization, lipiodol chemoembolization, and drug-eluting bead chemoembolization remains unknown and controversial. Methods/design: A prospective, open-label, multicenter randomized controlled trial will be conducted in patients with progressive or symptomatic unresectable NET liver metastases. Patients will be randomized to treatment with bland embolization, lipiodol chemoembolization, or drug-eluting microsphere chemoembolization, with 60 enrollees per arm. The primary endpoint will be hepatic progression-free survival (HPFS) following initial embolotherapy by RECIST criteria. The sample size is powered to detect an HR of 1.78 for HPFS following chemoembolization compared with bland embolization, which was estimated on the basis of existing retrospective studies. Secondary endpoints include overall progression-free survival, duration of symptom control, quality of life, rate of adverse events, and interval between embolotherapy cycles. Interim safety analyses will be performed at 10 and 30 patients per arm. Discussion: The RETNET trial is a prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trial designed to determine the optimal embolotherapy technique for NET liver metastases. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02724540 . Registered on March 31, 2016. Keywords: Chemoembolization; Embolization; Liver metastases; Neuroendocrine tumor.

      "brief_summary": "GI tract including pancreas is the one of most common primary sites of neuroendocrine tumors. Current grading of neuroendocrine tumors are based on the 2010 WHO classification. This classifies grade 3 tumors as the neuroendocrine tumor with mitosis \\> 20 per 10 high power field or Ki-67 labeling index \\> 20%. Etoposide-based chemotherapy, mostly as the combination with cisplatin, has been the mainstay of the treatment for patients with grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors. However, a recent large retrospective analysis has suggested this regimen may not be effective in relatively low Ki-67 labeling index. Therefore, the investigators designed a clinical trial testing temozolomide-capecitabine combination, which has been mostly investigated in well differentiated (ie., grade 1 or 2) neuroendocrine tumors, in patients with grade 3 and low Ki-67 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.",

Patients who have not responded to standard treatments will be included, and treatment will last for up to 12 months. The study will assess objective response, progression-free survival, and biomarkers such as PD-L1, ctDNA, and microvesicles, in a multicenter collaborative effort to provide innovative therapeutic options for this underrepresented population",
      "detailed_description": "The ANTARES study is a phase II \"basket\" trial designed to evaluate the tissue-agnostic efficacy of the monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with advanced or metastatic rare tumors. A \"basket\" trial is an innovative type of clinical trial where patients with different types of cancers, but sharing a common molecular feature (in this case, PD-L1 expression), are treated with the same therapy, regardless of the tumor's site of origin. This approach allows for the evaluation of treatments targeting specific molecular characteristics, independent of the primary cancer type.\n\nRare tumors, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), have an incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people per year. Although each rare cancer type is individually uncommon, collectively they account for 25-30% of all malignancies and are often underrepresented in clinical trials due to recruitment challenges and limited funding. As a result, patients with rare cancers generally have a poorer prognosis compared to those with more common tumors.\n\nIn this study, patients with advanced or refractory rare malignancies expressing PD-L1, with a combined positive score (CPS) of ≥10, will be treated with nivolumab. Treatment will be administered until disease progression or for a maximum duration of 12 months, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of this tissue-agnostic immunotherapy approach. Efficacy will be measured according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, with objective response as the primary endpoint. Additionally, the study will assess response biomarkers, including PD-L1, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and microvesicles, to better understand the correlation between biomarker expression and clinical outcomes.\n\nThis multicenter trial, with an estimated duration of four years, will be conducted at Institute of Cancer of the State of São Paulo (ICESP) and other partner institutions. The study aims to overcome existing barriers in rare cancer treatment by offering an innovative approach that explores the potential of personalized therapies based on molecular characteristics, rather than the tumor's primary site",

This study will also asses the safety of Lu-DOTA-TATE, and the quality of life of the patients treated with Lu-DOTA-TATE.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine (NET) tumours have secretory and metabolic pathways not typically found in other cancers that can be utilized for molecular imaging and therapeutic targeting. The most important is somatostatin. Somatostatin receptors are useful tools in the diagnosis and treatment of NET tumours because the somatostatin analogue octreotate can be radiolabeled with lutetium-177 for imaging and therapy.\n\nIn selected populations of patients, radioisotope therapy in expert hands has been shown to be a safe and effective palliative therapy with stable disease, progression free survival benefit, symptom control and improvements in quality of life. Lutetium-177 (DOTA0, Tyr3) octreotate has been used in a significant number of clinical studies shown to be safe and effective as a therapeutic agent in patients with NET tumours. The investigators intend to further confirm these benefits with lutetium-177 octreotate, which could form the basis for a national registry study leading to registration of this therapeutic intervention.",

This study examines survival predictors in patients who received 177 Lu-Dotatate. Methods: A retrospective single-center review was conducted, examining 47 individuals with progressive well-differentiated NETs treated with 177 Lu-Dotatate (four induction cycles of 5.5 GBq at 10-week intervals followed by eight maintenance cycles of 3.7 GBq at 6-month intervals). Results: Median follow-up was 63.1 months with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 34.1 months. However, median overall survival (OS) was not reached at the time of analysis. The presence of ≥ 5 bone metastases (hazard ratio HR 4.33; p = 0.015), non-gastroenteropancreatic (non-GEP) NETs (HR 3.22; p = 0.025) and development of interim ascites (HR 3.15; p = 0.047) independently predicted a worse OS. Patients with chromogranin A of ≥ 4 × upper limit of normal (ULN) had shorter OS (p < 0.001) and PFS (p = 0.004). Similarly, those with pre-existing ascites demonstrated a worse OS (p = 0.009) and PFS (p = 0.026). Liver metastases involving greater than 50% liver volume and the existence of unusual metastatic locations had a negative impact on OS (p = 0.033) and PFS (p = 0.026), respectively. Conclusion: High burden of skeletal and hepatic metastases, non-GEP-NETs, chromogranin A of ≥ 4 × ULN, unusual metastatic sites, pre-existing and interim ascites are predictors of poor outcomes in patients treated with 177 Lu-Dotatate. These common indicators can be used for the risk stratification and identification of patients most likely to benefit from PRRT.

The mainstay treatment of PanNENs is surgery, which is associated with a significant benefit in term of survival but also with significant short- and long-term adverse events.\n\nBased on the above data, less invasive alternative therapeutic interventions to avoid short- and long-term adverse events of surgery are needed.\n\nIn this context radiofrequency ablation has been reported to be effective in the treatment of these tumors in absence of major adverse events.

Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and (iii) rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours).\n\nThe role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.\n\nThis protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of nivolumab \\& ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 2 clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with rare cancers. This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab. If the safety profile is acceptable and clinically efficacy is seen, this study would support the use of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with these cancers.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, they are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. The rare care project has defined a rare malignancy as a cancer with an incidence of less than 6/100000/year. It is estimated that 42,000 people are diagnosed with a form of rare or less common cancer in Australia every year (www.canceraustralia.gov.au). The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of these patients. Given the recent success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a whole range of different cancer types, it can be postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. It is proposed here that patient cohorts which fall within three distinct tumour streams will be examined, with all patients receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy. The three tumour streams are defined as: upper GI malignancies (comprising intra-hepatic/ extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal cancers).); neuroendocrine tumours (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours). Although overall response rates for individual tumour types will not be established due to sample size (target 20 patients per tumour stream, n=60 total), descriptive information of individual patient responses will guide immune-directed therapies to responsive rare tumour types and may be broadened to tumour streams.",

Patients with advanced disease have a poor outcome with current therapies. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab in patients with advanced biliary tract cancers. Design, setting, and participants: The CA209-538 prospective multicenter phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial included patients with advanced rare cancers including patients with biliary tract cancers. This subgroup analysis evaluated 39 patients from CA209-538 with biliary tract cancers who were enrolled from December 2017 to December 2019. Most of the patients (n = 33) had experienced disease progression after 1 or more lines of therapy and had tumor tissue available for biomarker research. Interventions: Patients received treatment with nivolumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg and ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and continued for up to 96 weeks until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxic events. Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was disease control rate (complete remission, partial remission, or stable disease) as assessed by RECIST 1.1. Results: Among the 39 patients included in this subgroup analysis of a phase 2 clinical trial (20 men, 19 women; mean [range] age, 65 [37-81] years), the objective response rate was 23% (n = 9) with a disease control rate of 44% (n = 17); all responders had received prior chemotherapy, and none had a microsatellite unstable tumor. Responses were exclusively observed in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma. The median duration of response was not reached (range, 2.5 to ≥23 months). The median progression-free survival was 2.9 months (95% CI, 2.2-4.6 months), and overall survival was 5.7 months (95% CI, 2.7-11.9 months). Immune-related toxic events were reported in 49% of patients (n = 19), with 15% (n = 6) experiencing grade 3 or 4 events. Conclusions and relevance: This subgroup analysis of a phase 2 clinical trial found that combination immunotherapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab was associated with substantial positive outcomes patients with advanced biliary tract cancers. This treatment compares favorably to single-agent anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy and warrants further investigation. Ongoing translational research is focused on identifying biomarkers that can predict treatment response. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02923934 .

Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy and nivolumab may work better at treating non-small cell lung cancer.",

Abstract Background: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is the standard treatment for medically inoperable early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but regional or distant relapses, or both, are common. Immunotherapy reduces recurrence and improves survival in people with stage III NSCLC after chemoradiotherapy, but its utility in stage I and II cases is unclear. We therefore conducted a randomised phase 2 trial of SABR alone compared with SABR with immunotherapy (I-SABR) for people with early-stage NSCLC. Methods: We did an open-label, randomised, phase 2 trial comparing SABR to I-SABR, conducted at three different hospitals in TX, USA. People aged 18 years or older with histologically proven treatment-naive stage IA-IB (tumour size ≤4 cm, N0M0), stage IIA (tumour size ≤5 cm, N0M0), or stage IIB (tumour size >5 cm and ≤7 cm, N0M0) as per the American Joint Committee on Cancer version 8 staging system or isolated parenchymal recurrences (tumour size ≤7 cm) NSCLC (T any N any M0 before definitive surgery or chemoradiotherapy) were included in this trial. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1; using the Pocock & Simon method) to receive SABR with or without four cycles of nivolumab (480 mg, once every 4 weeks, with the first dose on the same day as, or within 36 h after, the first SABR fraction). This trial was unmasked. The primary endpoint was 4-year event-free survival (local, regional, or distant recurrence; second primary lung cancer; or death). Analyses were both intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03110978 ) and is closed to enrolment. Findings: From June 30, 2017, to March 22, 2022, 156 participants were randomly assigned, and 141 participants received assigned therapy. At a median 33 months' follow-up, I-SABR significantly improved 4-year event-free survival from 53% (95% CI 42-67%) with SABR to 77% (66-91%; per-protocol population, hazard ratio [HR] 0·38; 95% CI 0·19-0·75; p=0·0056; ITT population, HR 0·42; 95% CI 0·22-0·80; p=0·0080). There were no grade 3 or higher adverse events associated with SABR. In the I-SABR group, ten participants (15%) had grade 3 immunologial adverse events related to nivolumab; none had grade 3 pneumonitis or grade 4 or higher toxicity. Interpretation: Compared with SABR alone, I-SABR significantly improved event-free survival at 4 years in people with early-stage treatment-naive or lung parenchymal recurrent node-negative NSCLC, with tolerable toxicity. I-SABR could be a treatment option in these participants, but further confirmation from a number of currently accruing phase 3 trials is required.

      "brief_summary": "This is a single-arm, unicentric, single-stage clinical study of tamoxifen for patients with well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and radiological progression with positive (\\> 1 percent) HR (estrogen and / or progesterone) expression by IHC. It will evaluate if Tamoxifen exerts antitumor action in patients with well differentiated NET and positive for the expression of HR, estrogen and / or progesterone.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare neoplasms, but with increasing incidence and prevalence in the last decades. Although they may manifest in the most diverse tissues, the vast majority of cases will affect organs of the digestive tract and lung. At diagnosis, more than half of the cases present metastatic disease, and among patients with localized disease, up to one-third will have recurrence of the disease. Unfortunately, the minority of patients with metastatic disease are eligible for curative intent. Although there are many types of NET, they are often studied together as a group because their cells share common histological findings, have special secretory granules, and the ability to secrete bioactive amines and polypeptide hormones. Approximately 25 percent of the tumors present functional hormonal syndromes (situation of great morbidity for these patients), being the carcinoid syndrome, the most common one. From the molecular point of view, these neoplasias are largely dependent on the activation of the mTOR pathway and neoangiogenesis. Another striking feature of neuroendocrine cells is the expression of cell surface hormone receptors whose activation or blockade may exert an important regulatory function. The discovery of somatostatin, and consequently its receptors, is one of the major advances in the treatment of this neoplasm. Due to the increased ability of somatostatin to inhibit the secretion of several hormones, its antitumor property has long been studied. However, only after the development of synthetic long-life formulations can their use be used in clinical practice. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (G1 and G2 according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification) present in more than 80 percent of somatostatin receptor cases. In this population, the use of somatostatin analogues promotes symptomatic improvement of functioning syndromes in the order of 70 to 77 percent and biochemical improvement around 50 percent . Regarding antiproliferative activity, two phase III studies evaluated the role of octreotide LAR and of lanreotide autogel, both somatostatin analogs, in the population of well differentiated tumors and, almost entirely, somatostatin receptor hyperexpressors when evaluated by octreoscan. In these studies, the use of somatostatin analogue was associated with reduced risk of progression or death from 53 percent to 66 percent when compared to placebo. Currently, this class of drugs is often considered as the first treatment option for patients with progressing metastatic disease, when the strategy of watchful waiting is not opted for (because they are tumors of sometimes indolent behavior, some cases are selected for observation only). In general, there are few options for systemic therapies that are approved for these tumors in addition to somatostatin analogs (mTOR and antiangiogenic inhibitors), none of which clearly demonstrate overall survival gain, are costly and none are available for use in the public health system (SUS). Therefore, it is very important to develop studies with new therapies for patients with NET, especially, molecularly defined therapies with greater access to patients. In this context, other anti-hormonal therapies could be explored in patients with NET, such as the role of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, as well as their receptors. A few studies have evaluated the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in NET and suggest interesting results. One of the largest series was conducted at the AC Camargo Cancer Center where the immunohistochemical expression of these receptors was evaluated in 96 patients with NET from various sites. About 35 percent of the cases presented positivity for some hormonal receptor (HR) in the tumor tissue. Among the HR positive cases, there was no difference between sex, more frequent in thin, pancreatic and lung tumors and in well differentiated tumors (G1 and G2 by the WHO). Viale et al. Evaluated the expression of progesterone receptors (PR) in 96 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Nuclear immunoreactivity for PR was observed in 58 percent of cases, with no difference in PR expression according to gender, age, or functioning syndromes. About 163 primary tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic site and 115 metastases were evaluated by Zimmermann and colleagues for expression of female hormone receptors. Progesterone receptor was more frequently found in pancreatic tumors and rarely in non-pancreatic (p \\<0.001), estrogen receptor was more frequently expressed in non-pancreatic tumors (\\<0.001) and in women (p: 0.019). There was no difference between primary site and presence of metastases. Apparently, HR positive tumors may present a more favorable evolution. A study evaluated 160 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors operated for expression by PTEN immunohistochemistry (negative regulator of the mTOR pathway) and PR. Approximately 69 percent of the cases were positive for PR and PTEN, 28 percent were positive for one of the two markers and only 3 percent were negative for both. Combined positivity for PTEN and PR was associated with metastasis-free survival in stages I and II (p \\<0.001) and overall survival in all patients (p \\<0.001), even after adjustment for other prognostic variables. Patients with negative PR and PTEN tumors had the shorter survival times when compared to those who had only one or both markers (p \\<0.001). 9 Similarly, other author demonstrated a retrospective analysis of 277 patients with neuroendocrine tumors (95 percent vs. 76 percent, p \\<0.05), and a higher survival rate (p \\<0.05) than in the control group (p \\<0.05) 0.015). Even rarer in the literature is the role of antiestrogen therapies as a form of control of this neoplasia. Case reports point to antiproliferative activity of tamoxifen in patients with NET and, in some cases, patients presenting more than 12 months of disease control.11 Reports of control of carcinoid syndrome and even regression of associated retroperitoneal fibrosis have also been described. However, the only study to assess the activity of tamoxifen in neuroendocrine tumors dates back to 1984. Sixteen patients were evaluated clinical benefit in only 19 percent of cases and no radiological response. However, in this study, no patient was previously selected for HR tumor expression or degree of differentiation, which the investigators believe limited benefit in disease control. Therefore, based on the premise that there is a need for research and treatment strategies for this rare neoplasm; there is clear therapeutic embezzlement in the public heath system due to the high cost of the treatments approved in the country for this neoplasia; NET are tumors that may present positivity to estrogen and / or progesterone receptors; evidence points to the possibility of antiproliferative effect using hormonal therapy, the investigators propose a phase II study of tamoxifen for patients with well differentiated NET and positive for HR, estrogen and / or progesterone expression.",

Therefore, targeting ER/PR may offer an effective NET-directed treatment to select patients. Methods: We conducted a multicenter Simon two-stage single-arm phase II trial of tamoxifen in patients with metastatic, progressive NETs. Eligible patients had positive IHC expression of ER and/or PR ⩾ 1%. Prior therapy with somatostatin analogs was required for progressing/functioning cases. Main exclusion criterion was aggressive disease requiring cytotoxic therapy. The primary end point was disease control rate (DCR) at week 24 by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. We planned to enroll 23 patients in the first stage, to reach a DCR at week 24 of 70% ( versus 50%); if ⩾12 patients reached the primary end point, a total of 37 would be included. Results: From February 2019 to February 2022, 23 out of 59 patients were eligible and enrolled: 15 (65%) were females; the most common sites were pancreas (11; 48%) and small bowel (6; 26%). In all, 13 patients (56.5%) had G2 NETs. At a median follow-up of 27 months, 13 patients (56.5%) had stable disease at week 24 and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.9 months [interquartile range (IQR): 3.7-12.1]. The best response was stable disease in 13 patients, with most patients experiencing minor tumor growth. Median PFS times were not significantly different according to ER/PR < or ⩾30% ( p = 0.49) or ER versus PR expression ( p = 0.19). One patient experienced grade 2 constipation. Conclusion: Tamoxifen for ER-/PR-positive NETs patients is safe but offers modest antitumor effects.

While patients with other cancers have seen long-term disease control and tumor regression with the application of immunotherapies, initial prospective studies of single-agent programmed cell death 1 inhibitors in NET have been disappointing. Objective: To evaluate the response rate following treatment with the combination of the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor bevacizumab with the programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitor atezolizumab in patients with advanced NETs. Design, setting, and participants: This single-arm, open-label nonrandomized clinical study in patients with rare cancers included 40 patients with advanced, progressive grade 1 to 2 NETs (20 with pancreatic NETs [pNETs] and 20 with extrapancreatic NETs [epNETs]) treated at a tertiary care referral cancer center between March 31, 2017, and February 19, 2019. Data were analyzed from June to September 2021. Interventions: Patients received intravenous bevacizumab and atezolizumab at standard doses every 3 weeks until progression, death, or withdrawal. Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was objective radiographic response using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, with progression-free survival (PFS) as a key secondary end point. Results: Following treatment of the 40 study patients with bevacizumab and atezolizumab, objective response was observed in 4 patients with pNETs (20%; 95% CI, 5.7%-43.7%) and 3 patients with epNETs (15%; 95% CI, 3.2%-37.9%). The PFS was 14.9 (95% CI, 4.4-32.0) months and 14.2 (95% CI, 10.2-19.6) months in these cohorts, respectively. Conclusions and relevance: In this nonrandomized clinical trial, findings suggest that clinical responses in patients with NET may follow treatment with the combination of bevacizumab and atezolizumab, with a PFS consistent with effective therapies.

Abstract Background: The current standard of care (SoC) for the initial treatment of unresectable or metastatic well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) requires initiation of first-generation somatostatin receptor ligand (SRL) therapy, octreotide and lanreotide, which provide safe and efficacious tumour/symptom control in most patients. However, disease progression can occur with SoC SRL treatment and the optimal dose response of SRL remains unknown. Octreotide subcutaneous depot (CAM2029) is a novel, long-acting, high-exposure formulation that has shown greater bioavailability and improved administration than octreotide long-acting release (LAR) with a well-tolerated safety profile. Retrospective data have highlighted a potential benefit of high-exposure SRL for improved disease control in patients who did not adequately respond to the current SoC SRL treatment. This trial will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of CAM2029 compared to the current SoC, including octreotide LAR and lanreotide autogel (ATG). Methods: SORENTO is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, open-label phase 3 trial aiming to demonstrate superiority of treatment with 20 mg octreotide subcutaneous depot (CAM2029) every 2 weeks (Q2W) compared to treatment with the Investigator's choice of SRL therapy at standard doses for tumour control (octreotide LAR 30 mg or lanreotide ATG 120 mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]) as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS) in approximately 300 patients with unresectable/metastatic and well-differentiated GEP-NET. Upon confirmation of disease progression (determined by a Blinded Independent Review Committee [BIRC] and defined as per RECIST 1.1), patients may enter an open-label extension treatment period with once weekly dosing, to investigate the effects of higher frequency dosing. Overall survival follow-up will end a maximum of 2 years after primary analysis. The primary endpoint will be analysed after 194 confirmed PFS events. Discussion: This is the first trial investigating the efficacy of CAM2029 versus SoC SRL therapy using a head-to-head, superiority trial design. It is expected to be the first trial to investigate the efficacy of increased dosing frequency of a high-exposure SRL. A BIRC will limit bias and measurement variability and ensure high-quality efficacy data. Additionally, inclusion of patients with well-differentiated Grade 3 NET may elucidate treatment strategies for this rarely investigated patient population.

      "detailed_description": "When patients are suspected of having neuroendocrine tumours, they will usually undergo various imaging scans such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and octreotide scintigraphy (octreoscan) to try to identify the primary tumour. During the patients' course of disease, they will continue to have various CT, MRI, and/or octreoscans. Sometimes, despite using scans, laboratory tests, and examination, it is still difficult to properly diagnose neuroendocrine tumours.\n\nDoctors have found that most neuroendocrine tumours make too much of a hormone called somatostatin on their cell surface. Because of this doctors have been using positron emission tomography (PET) scans using a special contrast dye called 68Ga-DOTATATE in hopes of better diagnosing and managing neuroendocrine tumours. 68Ga-DOTATATE can label the cells that have somatostatin (such as neuroendocrine tumour cells) so that the PET scan can take better pictures and doctors can better diagnose and manage the disease.\n\nHowever, despite 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans showing promise, it is still not widely accessible. Because of this, researchers are creating a registry for patients who may need 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans to:\n\n* Identify their primary tumour where the doctor suspects is a neuroendocrine tumour\n* Staging of the neuroendocrine tumour\n* Restage the tumour prior to surgery/radiotherapy or help to assess the tumour where standard scans such as CTs, MRIs, or octreoscans are not properly showing your tumours despite other clinical or laboratory tests showing that your disease has progressed\n* For other issues when confirmation of site of disease and/or disease extent may impact clinical management of the neuroendocrine tumour.\n\nThis registry help the participant's treating physician to obtain approval for the participant to undergo 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans for their neuroendocrine tumour.",

Patients and methods: This analysis includes patients referred for the initial diagnosis of an unconfirmed NET, as part of a prospective, single-arm registry study ( NCT03873870 ) assessing the utility of 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT in the management of NETs. Inclusion criteria to this cohort consisted of elevated biomarkers and/or clinical presentation suspicious for a NET, with negative conventional cross-sectional imaging, or presence of a lesion suspicious for a NET on conventional imaging, not amenable for biopsy. Patients with histological confirmation of a NET were excluded. Results: There were 220 patients included between April 2019 and March 2022 with a mean age ± SD of 59.5 ± 16.1 years with biochemical, morphological, and/or clinical suspicion of a NET. Overall, 132/220 patients (60%) had a positive 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT. 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT confirmed a type 2 somatostatin receptor overexpressing tumor in 123/171 (71.9%) of patients with a radiographically suspicious abnormality. The positivity rate for pancreatic, small bowel/mesenteric, adrenal, and other sites was 78/96 (81.2%), 38/57 (66.7%), 7/7 (100%), and 1/11 (9.1%), respectively. 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT was positive in 9/49 (18.4%) of those with a biochemical and/or clinical suspicion of a NET. Conclusions: 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT is positive in nearly 3 of 4 patients with morphological suspicion of a NET, with the highest yield in those with pancreatic and small bowel or mesenteric masses, and in approximately 1 of 6 patients with biochemical and/or clinical suspicion of a NET.

The treatment of these tumours in an advanced setting is based on relatively little robust data. Recent findings: A recent pathological classification introduced a new category of high-grade but well differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NET G3), with markedly different behaviour from neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). Yet, the optimal treatment of those tumours is still uncertain. Advances are needed in molecular subtyping of NENs to understand better their heterogeneity and inform personalized therapies. Summary: The current review summarizes the current knowledge, indicates some exciting future directions and outlines the most interesting ongoing clinical trials likely to impact current practice.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help with such diagnosis, but existing AI models focus solely on a single modality. Objective: To advance the clinical diagnosis of solid lesions in the pancreas through developing a multimodal AI model integrating both clinical information and EUS images. Design, setting, and participants: In this randomized crossover trial conducted from January 1 to June 30, 2023, from 4 centers across China, 12 endoscopists of varying levels of expertise were randomly assigned to diagnose solid lesions in the pancreas with or without AI assistance. Endoscopic ultrasonographic images and clinical information of 439 patients from 1 institution who had solid lesions in the pancreas between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2022, were collected to train and validate the joint-AI model, while 189 patients from 3 external institutions were used to evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the model. Intervention: Conventional or AI-assisted diagnosis of solid lesions in the pancreas. Main outcomes and measures: In the retrospective dataset, the performance of the joint-AI model was evaluated internally and externally. In the prospective dataset, diagnostic performance of the endoscopists with or without the AI assistance was compared. Results: The retrospective dataset included 628 patients (400 men [63.7%]; mean [SD] age, 57.7 [27.4] years) who underwent EUS procedures. A total of 130 patients (81 men [62.3%]; mean [SD] age, 58.4 [11.7] years) were prospectively recruited for the crossover trial. The area under the curve of the joint-AI model ranged from 0.996 (95% CI, 0.993-0.998) in the internal test dataset to 0.955 (95% CI, 0.940-0.968), 0.924 (95% CI, 0.888-0.955), and 0.976 (95% CI, 0.942-0.995) in the 3 external test datasets, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of novice endoscopists was significantly enhanced with AI assistance (0.69 [95% CI, 0.61-0.76] vs 0.90 [95% CI, 0.83-0.94]; P < .001), and the supplementary interpretability information alleviated the skepticism of the experienced endoscopists. Conclusions and relevance: In this randomized crossover trial of diagnosing solid lesions in the pancreas with or without AI assistance, the joint-AI model demonstrated positive human-AI interaction, which suggested its potential to facilitate a clinical diagnosis. Nevertheless, future randomized clinical trials are warranted. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05476978 .

We aimed to assess the malignant potential of appendiceal NETs of 1-2 cm in size in patients with or without right-sided hemicolectomy. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we pooled data from 40 hospitals in 15 European countries for patients of any age and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status with a histopathologically confirmed appendiceal NET of 1-2 cm in size who had a complete resection of the primary tumour between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2010. Patients either had an appendectomy only or an appendectomy with oncological right-sided hemicolectomy or ileocecal resection. Predefined primary outcomes were the frequency of distant metastases and tumour-related mortality. Secondary outcomes included the frequency of regional lymph node metastases, the association between regional lymph node metastases and histopathological risk factors, and overall survival with or without right-sided hemicolectomy. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the relative all-cause mortality hazard associated with right-sided hemicolectomy compared with appendectomy alone. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03852693 . Findings: 282 patients with suspected appendiceal tumours were identified, of whom 278 with an appendiceal NET of 1-2 cm in size were included. 163 (59%) had an appendectomy and 115 (41%) had a right-sided hemicolectomy, 110 (40%) were men, 168 (60%) were women, and mean age at initial surgery was 36·0 years (SD 18·2). Median follow-up was 13·0 years (IQR 11·0-15·6). After centralised histopathological review, appendiceal NETs were classified as a possible or probable primary tumour in two (1%) of 278 patients with distant peritoneal metastases and in two (1%) 278 patients with distant metastases in the liver. All metastases were diagnosed synchronously with no tumour-related deaths during follow-up. Regional lymph node metastases were found in 22 (20%) of 112 patients with right-sided hemicolectomy with available data. On the basis of histopathological risk factors, we estimated that 12·8% (95% CI 6·5 -21·1) of patients undergoing appendectomy probably had residual regional lymph node metastases. Overall survival was similar between patients with appendectomy and right-sided hemicolectomy (adjusted hazard ratio 0·88 [95% CI 0·36-2·17]; p=0·71). Interpretation: This study provides evidence that right-sided hemicolectomy is not indicated after complete resection of an appendiceal NET of 1-2 cm in size by appendectomy, that regional lymph node metastases of appendiceal NETs are clinically irrelevant, and that an additional postoperative exclusion of metastases and histopathological evaluation of risk factors is not supported by the presented results. These findings should inform consensus best practice guidelines for this patient cohort. Funding: Swiss Cancer Research foundation. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This empiric regime results in highly variable absorbed doses to the critical organs and undertreatment of the majority of patients. We conceived a personalized PRRT protocol in which the IA is adjusted to deliver a prescribed absorbed dose to the kidney, with the aim to safely increase tumour irradiation. We herein report on the initial results of our prospective study of personalized PRRT, the P-PRRT Trial ( NCT02754297 ). Methods: PRRT-naïve patients with progressive and/or symptomatic neuroendocrine tumour (NET) were scheduled to receive a four-cycle induction course of 177 Lu-octreotate with quantitative SPECT/CT-based dosimetry. The IA was personalized according to the glomerular filtration rate and the body surface area for the first cycle, and according to the prior renal Gy/GBq for the subsequent cycles. The prescribed renal absorbed dose of 23 Gy was reduced by 25-50% in case of significant renal or haematological impairment. Responders were allowed to receive consolidation or maintenance cycles, for each of which 6 Gy to the kidney were prescribed. We simulated the empiric PRRT regime by fixing the IA at 7.4 GBq per cycle, with the same percentage reductions as above. Radiological, molecular imaging, biochemical, and quality of life responses, as well as safety, were assessed. Results: Fifty-two patients underwent 171 cycles. In 34 patients who completed the induction course, a median cumulative IA of 36.1 (range, 6.3-78.6) GBq was administered, and the median cumulative kidney and maximum tumour absorbed doses were 22.1 (range, 8.3-24.3) Gy and 185.7 (range: 15.2-443.1) Gy respectively. Compared with the simulated fixed-IA induction regime, there was a median 1.26-fold increase (range, 0.47-2.12 fold) in the cumulative maximum tumour absorbed dose, which was higher in 85.3% of patients. In 39 assessable patients, the best objective response was partial response in nine (23.1%), minor response in 14 (35.9%), stable disease in 13 (33.3%) and progressive disease in three patients (7.7%). In particular, 11 of 13 patients (84.6%) with pancreatic NET had partial or minor response. The global health status/quality of life score significantly increased in 50% of patients. Acute and subacute side-effects were all of grade 1 or 2, and the most common were nausea (in 32.7% of patients) and fatigue (in 30.8% of patients) respectively. Subacute grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred in less than 10% of patients, with the exception of lymphocytopenia in 51.9% of patients, without any clinical consequences however. No patient experienced severe renal toxicity. Conclusions: Personalized PRRT makes it possible to safely increase tumour irradiation in the majority of patients. Our first results indicate a favourable tolerance profile, which appears similar to that of the empiric regime. The response rates are promising, in particular in patients with NET of pancreatic origin.

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Background: Routine dosimetry is essential for personalized 177 Lu-octreotate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), but practical and robust dosimetry methods are needed for wide clinical adoption. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy and inter-observer reproducibility of simplified dosimetry protocols based on quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography (QSPECT) with a limited number of scanning time points. We also updated our personalized injected activity (IA) prescription scheme. Methods: Seventy-nine NET patients receiving 177 Lu-octreotate therapy (with a total of 279 therapy cycles) were included in our study. Three-time-point (3TP; days 0, 1, and 3) QSPECT scanning was performed following each therapy administration. Dosimetry was obtained using small volumes of interest activity concentration sampling for the kidney, the bone marrow and the tumor having the most intense uptake. Accuracy of the simplified dosimetry based on two-time-point (2TP; days 1 and 3, monoexponential fit) or a single-time-point (1TP D3 ; day 3) scanning was assessed, as well as that of hybrid methods based on 2TP for the first cycle and 1TP (day 1 or 3; 2TP/1TP D1 and 2TP/1TP D3 , respectively) or no imaging at all (based on IA only; 2TP/no imaging (NI)) for the subsequent induction cycles. The inter-observer agreement was evaluated for the 3TP, 2TP, and hybrid 2TP/1TP D3 methods using a subset of 60 induction cycles (15 patients). The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), body size descriptors (weight, body surface area (BSA), lean body weight (LBW)), and products of both were assessed for their ability to predict IA per renal absorbed dose at the first cycle. Results: The 2TP dosimetry estimates correlated highly with those from the 3TP data for all tissues (Spearman r > 0.99, P < 0.0001) with small relative errors between the methods, particularly for the kidney and the tumor, with median relative errors not exceeding 2% and interdecile ranges spanning over less than 6% and 4%, respectively, for the per-cycle and cumulative estimates. For the bone marrow, the errors were slightly greater (median errors < 6%, interdecile ranges < 14%). Overall, the strength of correlations of the absorbed dose estimates from the simplified methods with those from the 3TP scans tended to progressively decrease, and the relative errors to increase, in the following order: 2TP, 2TP/1TP D3 , 1TP D3 , 2TP/1TP D1 , and 2TP/NI. For the tumor, the 2TP/NI scenario was highly inaccurate due to the interference of the therapeutic response. There was an excellent inter-observer agreement between the three observers, in particular for the renal absorbed dose estimated using the 3TP and 2TP methods, with mean errors lesser than 1% and standard deviations of 5% or lower. The eGFR · LBW and eGFR · BSA products best predicted the ratio of IA to the renal dose (GBq/Gy) for the first cycle (Spearman r = 0.41 and 0.39, respectively; P < 0.001). For the first cycle, the personalized IA proportional to eGFR · LBW or eGFR · BSA decreased the range of delivered renal absorbed dose between patients as compared with the fixed IA. For the subsequent cycles, the optimal personalized IA could be determined based on the prior cycle renal GBq/Gy with an error of less than 21% in 90% of patients. Conclusions: A simplified dosimetry protocol based on two-time-point QSPECT scanning on days 1 and 3 post-PRRT provides reproducible and more accurate dose estimates than the techniques relying on a single time point for non-initial or all cycles and results in limited patient inconvenience as compared to protocols involving scanning at later time points. Renal absorbed dose over the 4-cycle induction PRRT course can be standardized by personalizing IA based on the product of eGFR with LBW or BSA for the first cycle and on prior renal dosimetry for the subsequent cycles.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy (using response rate per RECIST v1.1) of nivolumab and temozolomide for the treatment of patients with either small cell lung cancer that have progressed or recurred after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy (cohort 1), or progressive metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of any grade or primary site in any line of therapy (cohort 2).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety profile and toxicity of combination nivolumab and temozolomide as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5.0.\n\nII. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with combination nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIII. To evaluate the central nervous system (CNS) PFS of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether treatment with nivolumab and temozolomide leads to a decrease in immune-suppressive cell populations (ie myeloid-derived suppressor cells \\[MDSC\\]) in peripheral blood.\n\nII. To determine whether objective response rate (ORR), PFS, OS vary by tumor O6-methylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation at baseline.\n\nIII. To determine whether baseline tumor mutational burden is predictive of response to therapy in patients with SCLC treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIV. To determine whether changes in blood based mutation burden during treatment may predict clinical benefit.\n\nV. To determine whether a composite immune and tumor cell staining score can be developed with or without PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to predict response in the SCLC cohort.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of a 28 day cycle. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for 12 months, then every 12 weeks thereafter.",

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Background:: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are now an approved treatment for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC), an aggressive and incurable malignancy. However, the median survival for patients remains around 1 year, and treatment in the second line and beyond is associated with a low likelihood of response. There currently are no data regarding the optimal treatment of patients who progress on upfront chemo-immunotherapy, and biomarkers are needed to aid patient selection. Obtaining sufficient tissue for advanced molecular testing is a challenge in SCLC due to often limited or crushed tissue specimens. Reliable blood based biomarkers may augment tissue based testing and allow for repeated assessments that is often not possible with tumor tissue, and changes in the peripheral blood may provide information regarding the tumor microenvironment. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) exert immunosuppressive function and have been investigated as a potential barrier to response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Here we demonstrate that MDSC level and function can be readily assessed in the peripheral blood at multiple time points during treatment with combination immunotherapy and temozolomide. Results:: This report represents the first case of a patient with refractory SCLC treated with combination nivolumab and temozolomide as part of a clinical trial ( NCT03728361 ), who sustained a deep and durable clinical response that was accompanied by an early decrease in MDSC and improved T cell function (increased CD8 + and CD4 + T cell proliferation). We review the literature regarding use of ICI in SCLC and the evidence supporting MDSC as a possible target to enhance the activity of immunotherapy, and emphasize the importance of assessing immune cell subsets as correlative studies in clinical trials. Conclusion:: An assessment of MDSC level and function during treatment, as well as other immune cell subsets, should be included in prospective studies to further evaluate these assays as possible blood-based biomarkers.

We present the results for a phase II trial of combination nivolumab and temozolomide in patients with advanced NEN along with results of immune changes in peripheral blood. Patients and methods: NCT03728361 is a nonrandomized, phase II study of nivolumab and temozolomide in patients with NEN. The primary endpoint was response rate using RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Immune profiling was performed by mass cytometry to evaluate the effect on peripheral blood immune cell subsets. Results: Among all 28 patients with NEN, the confirmed response rate was 9/28 [32.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 15.9-52.4]. Of 11 patients with lung NEN, the response rate was 64% (n = 7); there was a significant difference in responses by primary tumor location (lung vs. others, P = 0.020). The median PFS was 8.8 months (95% CI: 3.9-11.1 months), and median OS was 32.3 months (95% CI: 20.7-not reached months). Exploratory blood immune cell profiling revealed an increase in circulating CD8+ T cells (27.9% ± 13.4% vs. 31.7% ± 14.6%, P = 0.03) and a decrease in CD4+ T cells (59.6% ± 13.1% vs. 56.5% ± 13.0%, P = 0.001) after 2 weeks of treatment. LAG-3-expressing total T cells were lower in patients experiencing a partial response (0.18% ± 0.24% vs. 0.83% ± 0.55%, P = 0.028). Myeloid-derived suppressor cell levels increased during the study and did not correlate with response. Conclusions: Combination nivolumab and temozolomide demonstrated promising activity in NEN.

Although this marker has good specificity, its sensitivity is moderate and its dosage is constraining, since it requires urine collection over 2-3 days and specific diet. Preliminary data suggested that overnight 5HIAA value may be representative of 24-hour 5HIAA value, and that plasma 5HIAA dosage could be a valuable alternative to urine 5HIAA dosage. The main objective of this study is to compare sensitivity and specificity of overnight 5HIAA value, 24-hour 5HIAA value and plasma 5HIAA value, in patients with small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors.",
      "detailed_description": "This study primarily aims at comparing the sensitivity and specificity of overnight 5HIAA value, 24-hour 5HIAA value and plasma 5HIAA value, in patients with small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors. Secondary objectives include the correlation of 5HIAA values with chromogranin A, carcinoid syndrome and tumor burden and the evaluation of the compliance to the diet and its correlation with 5HIAA values.\n\nThe study group will include patients with proven neuroendocrine tumors of various stages and functioning syndrome profile. A control group will be constituted with subjects having irritable bowel syndrome, in which a neuroendocrine tumor is ruled out. After providing informed consent, patients fitting with inclusion criteria will be included in the study. Patients will have to follow a specific diet, and interrupt/avoid certain medication, during the 2 days before and the 2 days during the sampling period. Whole urine samples will be collected during 2 consecutive days, in 4 parts (day1, night 1, day 2, night 2). Blood samples will be collected at the morning of days 2 and 3. Observance with diet and drug restriction will be evaluated at the morning of day 3.",

Objective: We compared the diagnostic performances of 24u5HIAA, overnight urinary 5HIAA (Ou5HIAA), and plasmatic 5HIAA (p5HIAA) in midgut NETs. Methods: This prospective, multicenter study included 80 patients with metastatic midgut NETs and 17 control patients with irritable bowel syndrome. 24u5HIAA, Ou5HIAA, and p5HIAA were measured in urine and plasma collected on 2 consecutive days following a specific recommended diet. Reproducibility of the biomarkers was evaluated by the Spearman test. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Correlations with the main clinical features and declared observance to the specific diet were assessed using AUROC and logistic regression models. Results: The reproducibility of 24u5HIAA, Ou5HIAA, and p5HIAA were excellent (ρ = 0.916; 0.897; 0.978, respectively, P < .001) with significant discrimination between patients and controls (AUROC = 0.795, P < .001; 0.757, P = .001; 0.717, P = .005, respectively). All 3 markers were correlated with the presence of carcinoid syndrome (AUROC = 0.702, P = .006; 0.701, P = .006; 0.697, P = .007, respectively), carcinoid heart disease (AUROC = 0.896; 0.887; 0.923, P < .001, respectively, P < .001), and liver metastatic involvement greater than 30% (AUROC = 0.827; 0.807; 0.849, P < .001, respectively, P < .001), independent from other traditional prognostic factors. Biomarker levels were similar between patients with optimal or suboptimal diet observance. Conclusion: Ou5HIAA and p5HIAA could be used as more convenient alternatives to 24u5HIAA in patients with metastatic midgut NETs. Prospective long-term studies with repeated dosages are needed.

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare but their incidence is growing. Alkylating agents (ALKY) are one of the main systemic treatments used, at least for advanced duodeno-pancreatic NETs, with a response rate of 30 to 40% and a median progression-free survival of 4 to 18 months. Chemotherapy is one of the few therapeutic weapons, along with everolimus, somatostatin analogs, and metabolic radiotherapy, for lung NETs, called typical and atypical carcinoids, even if the level of proof of efficacy for these treatments is lower than for duodeno-pancreatic NETs. Considering the available retrospective data, O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) appears to be a predictive factor of the response to ALKY. Oxaliplatin (OX) has demonstrated an interesting activity, with response rates between 17% and 30%. In a first retrospective study we showed that Gemox is effective in NET, and more recently that its activity is similar to that of ALKYs, but without being influenced by the MGMT status. Prospective studies are needed but our data suggests that ALKY should be offered first to patients with methylated MGMT tumors while Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy should be offered first to patients with unmethylated MGMT tumors.\n\nIn this project, we wish to evaluate the contribution of the MGMT methylation, evaluated in the tumor, in predicting the Objective Response (OR) in patients treated with ALKY and to evaluate a treatment with alkylating agents versus Oxaliplatin in patients with a duodeno-pancreatic or lung or unknown primitive NET.",

Alkylating agents (ALKY), temozolomide and streptozotocin, are the main chemotherapies used for advanced pancreatic NETs. According to retrospective data, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status appears to be a predictive factor of the response to ALKY. Aims: The main objective is to evaluate the value of tumor MGMT promoter (pMGMT) methylation in the prediction of the objective response (OR) at 3 months in patients treated with ALKY. Secondly, we will evaluate the value of MGMT immunohistochemistry and the efficacy of treatment with ALKY vs. oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (Ox). Materials and methods: A national, prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled and multicenter trial was designed. Main inclusion criteria are: adult patients with well-differentiated advanced duodeno-pancreatic, lung, or unknown primitive NETs with a validated indication for chemotherapy. pMGMT methylation will be assessed by pyrosequencing, but an ancillary study will compare this technique with others ones including MGMT immunohistochemistry. Results: A total of 104 patients will be randomly assigned (1:1 for unmethylated or 2:1 for methylated pMGMT NETs) to either the ALKY arm or to the Ox arm. Conclusion: Recruitment started on October 16, 2018 ( NCT03217097 ) and will be open in 21 centers in France.

O 6 -Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status, as proficient (p) or deficient (d), may predict the response to ALKY. Patients and methods: MGMT-NET (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03217097 ) was a phase II trial randomly assigning 1:1 for pMGMT or 2:1 for dMGMT-NETs to either ALKY or oxaliplatin (Ox). Inclusion criteria were a confirmed advanced pancreatic, thoracic, or unknown primary NETs with an indication for chemotherapy and tissue available. The primary aim was to detect a difference of 35% between the 3-month objective response rate (ORR) in pMGMT-NETs versus in dMGMT-NETs when treated with ALKY. A biomarker-stratified design was performed to compare ALKY and Ox in the dMGMT and pMGMT strata for the secondary end points. dMGMT was defined using pyrosequencing (PSQ; methylated MGMT ≥9%) and using immunochemistry ( H -score of MGMT <50) when PSQ was not interpretable. Results: From October 2018 to October 2021, 105 patients (55 pancreas, 38 thorax, 12 unknown) started either ALKY (n = 62) or Ox (n = 43). The median age was 63 years (range, 30-84), and 59% were males. NETs were G1 (19%), G2 (69%), or G3 (10%). Among patients with interpretable MGMT status, 56.9% (58 of 102) had a dMGMT-NET. The primary end point was not reached; the 3-month ORR was 10 (29.4%) versus 2 (8%), and the odds ratio was 3.5 (0.58-21.16), P = .172. However, best ORR (18 [52.9%] v 3 [11.5%]) and median progression-free survival (14.6 [95% CI, 7.2 to 22.1] v 11.3 [9.4 to 13.2] months) were higher for dMGMT-NETs versus pMGMT-NETs. MGMT status does not seem to affect the Ox efficacy. Conclusion: Despite the fact that the primary end point was not reached, ALKY has clinical activity in patients with dMGMT-NETs.

      "brief_summary": "The four tumour streams that will be studied in this protocol are based on immunotherapy sensitive rare cancers from CA209-538 which will be further investigated under this protocol and divided into four groups:\n\n1. Neuroendocrine cancers: Atypical bronchial carcinoid, neuroendocrine carcinoma and Grade 3 NETs independent of primary site (SCLC excluded)\n2. Biliary tract cancers: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma\n3. Gynaecological malignancies: Ovarian clear cell carcinoma, uterine clear cell carcinoma, uterine/ovarian carcinosarcoma, uterine leiomyosarcoma and vaginal/vulva squamous cell carcinoma\n4. Mismatch repair protein deficient (MSI-H) cancers (excluding colorectal carcinoma).\n\nThe role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.\n\nThis protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of nivolumab \\& ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 2 clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in immunotherapy sensitive rare cancers. This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) \\>6 months and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, patients are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. CA209-538 examined this treatment combination in three 'baskets' of rare cancers: rare upper gastrointestinal, gynaecological and neuroendocrine cancers. The cancers on study all individually had an incidence of \\<2/100000/year. The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of rare cancer patients. Given the success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a range of different cancer types, it was postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. CA209-538 enrolled 120 rare cancer patients on study, clinical benefit rate was \\>30% across all baskets, long term survival follow-up is underway.\n\nThis study will enrol 240 participants, across 4 cohorts with histotypes which demonstrated clinical benefit on CA209-538. All participants will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy.",

The treatment of patients with metastatic disease remains an area of significant unmet need. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of combined anti-programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1)/cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) blockade using nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced gynecological CCCs. Design, setting, and participants: The MoST-CIRCUIT prospective multicenter phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial included patients with advanced selected rare cancers. Patients with advanced clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC)/clear cell endometrial cancer (CCEC) with a maximum of 1 course of prior systemic therapy were enrolled from August 2021 to February 2024 across 17 Australian and New Zealand sites. Interventions: Patients received nivolumab, 3 mg/kg, and ipilimumab, 1 mg/kg, every 3 weeks for 4 doses followed by nivolumab, 480 mg, every 4 weeks for 96 weeks until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxic effects. Main outcomes and measures: Coprimary end points were objective response rate (ORR) and 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by RECIST version 1.1 criteria, with the secondary end points being median overall survival, PFS, and treatment-related toxic effects. Results: Of 28 included patients, the median (range) age was 55 (34-77) years. A total of 24 had CCOC and 4 had CCEC; 19 (68%) had a previous course of therapy. Overall ORR was 54% (95% CI, 35-71), with 3 (12%) with complete response and 12 (42%) with partial response; the ORR was 55% (95% CI, 35-73) in the CCOC group and 50% (95% CI, 9-91) in the CCEC group. The median duration of response has not been reached, with all responses ongoing. The 6-month PFS was 58% (95% CI, 39-74), and the median overall survival has not been reached. A total of 9 patients (35%) experienced a grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse event, and a grade 5 myocarditis occurred in 1 patient. Conclusions and relevance: In this nonrandomized clinical trial, immunotherapy using combined anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade demonstrated encouraging activity with a high rate of durable responses in patients with advanced gynecological CCCs. This regimen should be further investigated in this patient population with unmet medical need. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04969887 .

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Background: Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) are difficult to diagnose in the early stage of disease. Current blood biomarkers such as chromogranin A (CgA) and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid have low sensitivity (SEN) and specificity (SPE). This is a first preplanned interim analysis (Nordic non-interventional, prospective, exploratory, EXPLAIN study [ NCT02630654 ]). Its objective is to investigate if a plasma protein multi-biomarker strategy can improve diagnostic accuracy (ACC) in SI-NETs. Methods: At the time of diagnosis, before any disease-specific treatment was initiated, blood was collected from patients with advanced SI-NETs and 92 putative cancer-related plasma proteins from 135 patients were analyzed and compared with the results of age- and sex-matched controls (n = 143), using multiplex proximity extension assay and machine learning techniques. Results: Using a random forest model including 12 top ranked plasma proteins in patients with SI-NETs, the multi-biomarker strategy showed SEN and SPE of 89 and 91%, respectively, with negative predictive value (NPV) and positive predictive value (PPV) of 90 and 91%, respectively, to identify patients with regional or metastatic disease with an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 99%. In 30 patients with normal CgA concentrations, the model provided a diagnostic SPE of 98%, SEN of 56%, and NPV 90%, PPV of 90%, and AUROC 97%, regardless of proton pump inhibitor intake. Conclusion: This interim analysis demonstrates that a multi-biomarker/machine learning strategy improves diagnostic ACC of patients with SI-NET at the time of diagnosis, especially in patients with normal CgA levels. The results indicate that this multi-biomarker strategy can be useful for early detection of SI-NETs at presentation and conceivably detect recurrence after radical primary resection.

Our aim is to assess changes in TNM staging and differences in patient management between [ 18 F]AlF-OC PET/CT and [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT in the work-up of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients. Patients who underwent both [ 18 F]AlF-OC and [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE or [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-NOC PET/CT in our multicenter study (Pauwels et al., J Nucl Med.2023;63:632-638) with a NET were included for analysis. TNM staging was determined and compared for both tracers. For each patient, the blinded [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA or [ 18 F]AlF-OC PET/CT images were presented in random order at a multidisciplinary team board. The images were presented together with clinical information and compared with previous SSTR and [ 18 F]FDG PET/CT imaging. After a consensus decision for patient management was recorded, the board was presented with the PET/CT images from the other SSTR tracer and a decision was made for the second tracer. Differences in management were classified as major if it entailed an intermodality change and minor if it led to an intramodality change. Compared with [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA, the use of [ 18 F]AlF-OC led to a change in 16/75 patients: TNM staging changes in 10/75 patients (13.3%; downstaging in 3/10, upstaging in 7/10) and differences in clinical management were seen in 10/75 patients (13.3%), leading to a major difference in 7/10 cases and a minor change in 3/10 cases. All 10 cases with a difference in patient management between both PET tracers were caused by additional lesion detection by [ 18 F]AlF-OC. The use of [ 18 F]AlF-OC did not impact TNM staging or clinical management in the large majority of the patients (86.7%), further validating the potential for routine clinical use of [ 18 F]AlF-OC PET/CT as an alternative for [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA PET/CT. The trial is registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04552847 and EudraCT 2020-000549-15.

Recently, 18 F-AlF-NOTA-octreotide ( 18 F-AlF-OC) has emerged as a promising candidate, but a thorough comparison with 68 Ga-DOTA-SSA in large patient groups is needed. This prospective, multicenter trial aims to demonstrate noninferiority of 18 F-AlF-OC compared with 68 Ga-DOTA-SSA PET in NET patients (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04552847 ). Methods: Seventy-five patients with histologically confirmed NET and routine clinical 68 Ga-DOTATATE ( n = 56) or 68 Ga-DOTANOC ( n = 19) PET, performed within a 3-mo interval of the study scan (median, 7 d; range, -30 to +32 d), were included. Patients underwent a whole-body PET 2 h after intravenous injection of 4 MBq/kg of 18 F-AlF-OC. A randomized, masked consensus read was performed by 2 experienced readers to count tumor lesions. After unmasking, the detection ratio (DR) was determined for each scan, that is, the fraction of lesions detected on a scan compared with the union of lesions of both scans. The differential DR (DDR; difference in DR between 18 F-AlF-OC and 68 Ga-DOTATATE/NOC) per patient was calculated. Tracer uptake was evaluated by comparing SUV max and tumor-to-background ratios in concordant lesions. Results: In total, 4,709 different tumor lesions were detected: 3,454 with 68 Ga-DOTATATE/NOC and 4,278 with 18 F-AlF-OC. The mean DR with 18 F-AlF-OC was significantly higher than with 68 Ga-DOTATATE/NOC (91.1% vs. 75.3%; P < 10 -5 ). The resulting mean DDR was 15.8%, with a lower margin of the 95% CI (95% CI, 9.6%-22.0%) higher than -15%, which is the prespecified boundary for noninferiority. The mean DDRs for the 68 Ga-DOTATATE and 68 Ga-DOTANOC subgroups were 11.8% (95% CI, 4.3-19.3) and 27.5% (95% CI, 17.8-37.1), respectively. The mean DDR for most organs was higher than zero, except for bone lesions (mean DDR, -2.8%; 95% CI, -17.8 to 12.2). No significant differences in mean SUV max were observed ( P = 0.067), but mean tumor-to-background ratio was significantly higher with 18 F-AlF-OC than with 68 Ga-DOTATATE/NOC (31.7 ± 36.5 vs. 25.1 ± 32.7; P = 0.001). Conclusion: 18 F-AlF-OC is noninferior and even superior to 68 Ga-DOTATATE/NOC PET in NET patients. This validates 18 F-AlF-OC as an option for clinical practice somatostatin receptor PET.

In particular, [ 18 F]AlF-OC has already shown excellent clinical performance. We demonstrated in our previous report from our prospective multicenter trial that [ 18 F]AlF-OC PET/CT outperforms [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA, but histological confirmation was lacking due to ethical and practical reasons. In this second arm, we therefore aimed to provide evidence that the vast majority of [ 18 F]AlF-OC PET lesions are in fact true NET lesions by analyzing their MR characteristics on simultaneously acquired MRI. We had a special interest in lesions solely detected by [ 18 F]AlF-OC (\"incremental lesions\"). Methods: Ten patients with a histologically confirmed neuroendocrine tumor (NET) and a standard-of-care [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT, performed within 3 months, were prospectively included. Patients underwent a whole-body PET/MRI (TOF, 3 T, GE Signa), 2 hours after IV injection of 4 MBq/kg [ 18 F]AlF-OC. Positive PET lesions were evaluated for a corresponding lesion on MRI. The diagnostic performance of both PET tracers was evaluated by determining the detection ratio (DR) for each scan and the differential detection ratio (DDR) per patient. Results: In total, 195 unique lesions were detected: 167 with [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATATE and 193 with [ 18 F]AlF-OC. The DR for [ 18 F]AlF-OC was 99.1% versus 91.4% for [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATATE, significant for non-inferiority testing (p = 0.0001). Out of these 193 [ 18 F]AlF-OC lesions, 96.2% were confirmed by MRI to be NET lesions. Thirty-three incremental lesions were identified by [ 18 F]AlF-OC, of which 91% were confirmed by MRI and considered true positives. Conclusion: The DR of [ 18 F]AlF-OC was numerically higher and non-inferior to the DR of [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATATE. [ 18 F]AlF-OC lesions and especially incremental lesions were confirmed as true positives by MRI in more than 90% of lesions. Taken together, these data further validate [ 18 F]AlF-OC as a new alternative for SSTR PET in clinical practice. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04552847 .

Materials and methods: This is a secondary endpoint analysis from our multicenter trial (clin trial.gov identifier: NCT04552847 ) including 75 NEN patients who received both [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTATATE (n = 56) or [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-NOC (n = 19) and [ 18 F]AlF-OC PET imaging. Five readers assessed lesion detection and characterization across multiple organs, scoring lesions by number and conspicuity using a 5-point Likert scale. Agreement was measured using Gwet's agreement coefficient. Results: Results demonstrated nearly perfect interobserver agreement for lesion characterization across all organs for both tracers (0.921 for [ 18 F]AlF-OC; 0.934 for [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSA). Similar agreement was observed for the number of lesions across organs (0.736 for [ 18 F]AlF-OC and 0.749 for [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSAs). Organ-specific analysis revealed strong agreement for bone and liver lesions, with slightly lower agreement for lymph nodes. Both tracers also showed excellent agreement in determining Krenning scores (0.925 for [ 18 F]AlF-OC and 0.927 for [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSAs). While mean lesion conspicuity was similar between tracers, [ 18 F]AlF-OC had a higher global image quality score (4.22 vs. 3.86, p < 0.0001). Intraobserver agreement was consistent between tracers for lesion characterization (> 0.95 for both readers) and lesion count (> 0.80 for both readers). Conclusion: [ 18 F]AlF-OC and [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSAs demonstrate comparable and excellent inter- and intraobserver agreement, reinforcing the clinical interchangeability of [ 18 F]AlF-OC PET/CT with [ 68 Ga]Ga-DOTA-SSAs in routine practice.

      "brief_summary": "Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) are a sub-group of aggressive neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN). The most common primary sites are broncho-pulmonary and digestive. The gastroentero-pancreatic NECs (GEP-NEC) represent 7-21% of all of the NENs.\n\nRecent data on the initial presentation of GEP-NEC have been reported in two retrospective studies and a French cohort study. No standard second-line treatment has been defined for NECs. Despite a very negative prognosis, these NECs have a certain amount of chemosensitivity, close to that of bronchial NECs. Multiple-drug therapies such as Folfiri, or Folfox, or single drug treatments such as temozolomide are the proposed options but with a low level of proof Bevacizumab associated with a cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown promising results in well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET), known for being hypervascular. The efficacy of bevacizumab has also been suggested in patients with NEC, but never in the context of a phase II study. Its combination with Folfiri is efficient and well tolerated in metastatic colorectal cancer. The combination Folfiri-bevacizumab potentially represents an optimized treatment compared to chemotherapy with only Folfiri. No phase II or III studies have reported results for these patients, and no on-going phase II or III trial have been identified to date.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to show that, after the failure of a first-line chemotherapy using platinum-etoposide, the combination Folfiri-bevacizumab allows significant prolongation of overall survival in adult patients with GEP-NEC.",

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, and FOLFIRI alone, in this setting. Methods: We did a randomised, non-comparative, open-label, phase 2 trial (PRODIGE 41-BEVANEC) at 26 hospitals in France. We included patients aged 18 years or older with locally advanced or metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma or neuroendocrine carcinoma of unknown primary origin, documented progressive disease during or after first-line platinum-etoposide chemotherapy, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1; block size of three), without stratification, to receive FOLFIRI (irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 , calcium folinate 400 mg/m 2 or levofolinate 200 mg/m 2 , and fluorouracil 400 mg/m 2 bolus then 2400 mg/m 2 over 46 h) plus bevacizumab 5 mg/kg or FOLFIRI alone, intravenously, every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was overall survival at 6 months after randomisation, evaluated in the modified intention-to-treat population (all enrolled and randomly assigned patients who received at least one cycle of FOLFIRI). This study is now complete and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02820857 . Findings: Between Sept 5, 2017, and Feb 8, 2022, 150 patients were assessed for eligibility and 133 were enrolled and randomly assigned: 65 to the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group and 68 to the FOLFIRI group. 126 patients (59 in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group and 67 in the FOLFIRI group) received at least one cycle of FOLFIRI and were included in the modified intention-to-treat population, 83 (66%) of whom were male and 43 (34%) were female, and the median age of the patients was 67 years (IQR 58-73). The primary tumour location was colorectal in 38 (30%) of 126 patients, pancreatic in 34 (27%), gastro-oesophageal in 22 (17%), and unknown in 23 (18%). After a median follow-up of 25·7 months (95% CI 22·0-38·2), 6-month overall survival was 53% (80% CI 43-61) in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group and 60% (51-68) in the FOLFIRI group. Grade 3-4 adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients were neutropenia (eight [14%] patients), diarrhoea (six [10%]), and asthenia (five [8%]) in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group, and neutropenia (seven [10%]) in the FOLFIRI group. One treatment-related death (ischaemic stroke) occurred in the FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab group. Interpretation: The addition of bevacizumab did not seem to increase the benefit of FOLFIRI with regard to overall survival. FOLFIRI could be considered as a standard second-line treatment in patients with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma. Funding: French Ministry of Health and Roche SAS.

However, nearly all patients will develop resistance and there is no standard second-line treatment. Aim: PRODIGE 41-BEVANEC is an academic randomized, phase II study designed to evaluate the efficacy of bevacizumab in combination with FOLFIRI after failure of CT1 in unknown primary NEC and GEP-NEC. Materials and methods: The main eligibility criteria are age ≥18 years, metastatic (synchronous or metachronous) or locally advanced, non-resectable, grade 3 GEP-NEC, and documented progressive disease during or after CT1 therapy. Results: A total of 124 patients will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 5 mg/kg bevacizumab with FOLFIRI, or FOLFIRI alone, every 14 days until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The hypothesis is to demonstrate a 6-month overall survival for at least 50% of the patients in bevacizumab arm versus 35% in the control arm (FOLFIRI alone). Secondary endpoints are objective response, response duration, progression-free survival, toxicity, and biochemical response. Conclusion: The study is currently opened in France ( NCT02820857 ). The first patient was randomized on September 6, 2017. Keywords: Bevacizumab; Clinical trial; FOLFIRI; Gastroenteropancreatic; Neuroendocrine carcinoma.

We provide a comprehensive analysis of this malignancy with molecular and clinical trial data on a subset of our cohort to report on the potential efficacy of somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2)-targeting imaging and therapy. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 404 primary, locally recurrent, and metastatic olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) patients from 12 institutions in the United States of America, United Kingdom and Europe. Clinicopathological characteristics and treatment approach were evaluated. SSTR2 expression, SSTR2-targeted imaging and the efficacy of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy [PRRT]( 177 Lu-DOTATATE) were reported in a subset of our cohort (LUTHREE trial; NCT03454763 ). Results: Dural infiltration at presentation was a significant predictor of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in primary cases (n = 278). Kadish-Morita staging and Dulguerov T-stage both had limitations regarding their prognostic value. Multivariable survival analysis demonstrated improved outcomes with lower stage and receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy. Prophylactic neck irradiation significantly reduces the rate of nodal recurrence. 82.4% of the cohort were positive for SSTR2; treatment of three metastatic cases with SSTR2-targeted peptide-radionuclide receptor therapy (PRRT) in the LUTHREE trial was well-tolerated and resulted in stable disease (SD). Conclusions: This study presents pertinent clinical data from the largest dataset, to date, on ONB. We identify key prognostic markers and integrate these into an updated staging system, highlight the importance of adjuvant radiotherapy across all disease stages, the utility of prophylactic neck irradiation and the potential efficacy of targeting SSTR2 to manage disease.

Recent findings: Following NETTER-1 trial, PRRT with [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE was approved by FDA and EMA and is routinely employed in advanced G1 and G2 SST (somatostatin receptor)-expressing NET. Different approaches have been proposed so far to improve the PRRT therapeutic index, encompassing re-treatment protocols, combinations with other therapies and novel indications. Molecular imaging holds a potential added value in characterizing disease biology and heterogeneity using different radiopharmaceuticals (e.g., SST and FDG) and may provide predictive and prognostic parameters. Response assessment criteria are still an unmet need and new theranostic pairs showed preliminary encouraging results. PRRT for NET has become a paradigm of modern theranostics. PRRT holds a favorable toxicity profile, and it is associated with a prolonged time to progression, reduction of symptoms, and improved patients' quality of life. In light of further optimization, different new strategies have been investigated, along with the development of new radiopharmaceuticals.

These tumors have a high lymph node and distant metastatic potential (hepatic, pulmonary, etc.). Their management is essentially surgical and the extent of the resection essentially depends on preoperative data from conventional and isotopic imaging.\n\nThe goal of surgical resection is to remove the portion of the small intestine carrying the tumour(s) with healthy margins (so-called R0 resection) and affected lymph nodes in the mesentery (lymph node dissection). The extent of lymph node dissection, sometimes significant, exposes you to the risk of short hail with its own complications (malnutrition, diarrhoea, etc.). Consequently, an analysis of the benefits and risks between the interest of an extensive and oncological resection (R0) and the risks of short bowel must be carried out for each patient.\n\nThe reference examination to define lymph node involvement is determined by the histological examination of the resected surgical specimen (reference examination). The preoperative evaluation of lymph node extension is done by preoperative abdominal CT scan. However, the preoperative CT scan is not always consistent (sensitivity and specificity) with the pathology data (reference examination). For about 5 years, isotopic imaging (DOPA-PET and DOTATOC) has become feasible and could improve the quality of preoperative evaluation of lymph node extension. Consequently, the aim of this study is to determine the contribution of isotopic imaging (DOPA-PET and DOTATOC) in the preoperative evaluation of lymph node extension.",

Our primary objective is to evaluate if there is a difference in post-treatment tumor-to-non-tumor (T/N) activity concentration ratio on SPECT/CT between the intra-arterial treated liver lobe and the intravenous treated liver lobe.",
      "detailed_description": "Rationale: The majority of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients present with metastases, most often including liver metastases. These patients have a poorer prognosis and lower quality of life.\n\nCurrently, intravenous administered somatostatin-bound radionuclides (177Lu-dotatate) have shown to improve tumor response rates and progression free survival (PFS). Despite of the increased tumor response rate and PFS, liver metastases still remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Patients with liver metastases have a worse outcome in terms of overall survival after treatment with 177Lu-dotatate compared to patients with limited or no liver metastases.\n\nObjective: to investigate the impact of intra-arterial (IA) administration of 177Lu-dotatate on the intrahepatic biodistribution in patients with NET liver metastases. Our primary objective is to evaluate if there is a difference in post-treatment tumor-to-non-tumor (T/N) activity concentration ratio on SPECT/CT between the intra-arterial treated liver lobe and the intravenous treated liver lobe.\n\nStudy design: Multicenter, interventional, block randomized, phase 2 clinical trial. We use a within-subject controlled design where the administration of 177Lu-dotatate is randomized between the right or left hepatic artery. Selective IA administration of 177Lu-dotatate allows for intra-patient comparison between IA administration (one lobe) versus IV 'administration' (the other lobe). The contralateral liver lobe and the rest of the body receive treatment by second pass IV route.\n\nStudy population: 26 patients with NET liver metastases (\\> 18 years old). Intervention: Treatment will be randomized between selective right or left hepatic artery administration of 177Lu-dotatate (Four administrations of 7.4 GBq; each via the same randomly allocated hepatic artery during angiography).\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: To assess if there is a difference in post-treatment tumor-to-non-tumor (T/N) activity concentration ratio on SPECT/CT between the intra-arterial treated liver lobe and the intravenous treated liver lobe. The T/N activity concentration will be measured on SPECT/CT. The primary endpoint will be assessed after the first treatment cycle. The T/N activity ratios of the second, third, and final treatment cycle will be assessed as secondary endpoint. Tumor response, toxicity, extrahepatic uptake and kidney uptake are secondary endpoints. Intra- and inter-patient differences will be studied.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: As with the standard IV treatment with 177Lu-dotatate, the treatment consists of four cycles. During each cycle, patients will be admitted for 1 night and undergo physical examination, laboratory examination, angiography with administration of the treatment dose, and post-treatment imaging. Risks include standard complication risks related to angiography (bleeding or infection). No additional risks with relation to the treatment itself are expected compared to the standard IV treatment (nausea, vomiting).",

However, survival and response rates are significantly lower in patients with bulky liver metastases. Increasing the tumor-absorbed dose in liver metastases may improve response to 177 Lu-DOTATATE. The LUTIA (Lutetium Intra-Arterial) study aims to increase the tumor-absorbed dose in liver metastases by intra-arterial (IA) administration of 177 Lu-DOTATATE, compared to conventional intravenous (IV) administration. Methods: A multicenter, within-patient randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 26 patients with progressive, liver-dominant, unresectable grade I or grade II NET will be conducted. Patients with bilobar bulky disease will be randomly allocated to receive IA treatment into either the left or the right hepatic artery. Using this approach, one liver lobe will be treated intra-arterially (first-pass effect), while the contralateral lobe will receive an intravenous treatment as a second-pass effect. The primary endpoint of this study is the difference in tumor-to-non-tumor ratio of 177 Lu-DOTATATE uptake between the two liver lobes on post-treatment SPECT/CT (IA versus IV). Secondary endpoints include absorbed dose in both liver lobes, tumor response, dose-response relationship, toxicity, uptake in extrahepatic lesions, and renal uptake. Discussion: This multicenter, within-patient RCT will investigate whether IA administration of 177 Lu-DOTATATE results in a higher activity concentration in liver metastases compared to IV administration.

      "brief_summary": "In gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), radical surgery provides good long-term outcome and low recurrence rates. In GEP-NETs the actual surgical planning is established on the ground of preoperative morphology images (CT scan), and functional imaging using CT/PET with 68Ga-DOTA-TOC, since the high expression of somatostatin receptors (SSR) of these tumors. RGS in GEP-NETs, mainly with gamma-probes, has been not widely accepted since the low rates of sensitivity and, in particular, specificity, in discriminating tumoral/ non tumoral tissue and background ratio. This is a relevant issue in particular in detecting metastatic lymph-nodes both for small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Pan-NETs), where the presence of lymph-node metastases has been associated with worse long-term outcome. At present, it is not possible to distinguish whether a small lymph-node is site of metastases or not without performing frozen sections. In a previous study ex-vivo from European Institute of Oncology SI-NET presented a high uptake of a beta-emitting radiotracer, 90Y-DOTA-TOC. Five SI-NET showing SSR positivity at PET with 68Ga DOTA-TOC received 5 mCi of 90Y-DOTA-TOC the day before surgery. All the tumor samples showed high counts of radioactivity with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 100%. These results allowed the investigators to develop a probe, which is now approved for in-vivo employment within the operating theatre. The objective of the present study is to verify in-vivo within the abdominal cavity the capability of the probe to detect 68-Ga activity within tumoral tissue thus favouring radical surgery and avoiding unnecessary demolition, in the near future. However, in the present protocol the entity of surgery will not be modified by intraoperative findings of the probe. It is reasonable to assume that results from 68Ga-DOTA-TOC might be comparable to 90Y-DOTA-TOC as radiotracer, and the detection efficacy of the probe for 68Ga could be not inferior compared to the isotope 90Y. However, while 90Y-DOTA-TOC is used as investigational drug for therapy purposes only within clinical research protocol, 68Ga-DOTA-TOC is a diagnostic radiotracer broadly used in day-to-day clinical practice since many years. Furthermore, the administration of 68Ga-DOTA-TOC can be directly injected in surgery room and thus does not require patients' admission the day before surgery.",

In gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), it provides good long-term outcome and low recurrence rates. For breast cancer radio-guided surgery (RGS), using gamma radiations, is a well standardised methods because it aids to remove non-palpable lesions.

Previous studies showed low specificity (SP) using γ-probes to detect radiation emitted by radio-labeled somatostatin analogs. Objective: We aimed to assess the sensitivity (SE) and SP of the intraoperative RGS approach using a β-probe with a per-lesion analysis, while assessing safety and feasibility as secondary objectives. Methods: This prospective, single-arm, single-center, phase II trial ( NCT05448157 ) enrolled 20 patients diagnosed with small intestine NETs (SI-NETs) with positive lesions detected at 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Patients received an intravenous injection of 1.1 MBq/Kg of 68Ga-DOTA-TOC 10 min prior to surgery. In vivo measurements were conducted using a β-probe. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed, with the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) as the independent variable and pathology result (cancer vs. non-cancer) as the dependent variable. The area under the curve (AUC), optimal TBR, and absorbed dose for the surgery staff were reported. Results: The intraoperative RGS approach was feasible in all cases without adverse effects. Of 134 specimens, the AUC was 0.928, with a TBR cut-off of 1.35 yielding 89.3% SE and 86.4% SP. The median absorbed dose for the surgery staff was 30 µSv (range 12-41 µSv). Conclusion: This study reports optimal accuracy in detecting lesions of SI-NETs using the intraoperative RGS approach with a novel β-probe. The method was found to be safe, feasible, and easily reproducible in daily clinical practice, with minimal radiation exposure for the staff. RGS might potentially improve radical resection rates in SI-NETs.

Materials and methods: this is a pilot analysis performed in three patients who received an intra-operative administration of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 (n = 2) and 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC (n = 1), respectively. Patients were administrated with PET radiopharmaceuticals to perform radio-guided surgery with a beta-probe detector during radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer (PCa) and salvage lymphadenectomy for recurrent neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of the ileum, respectively. All procedures have been performed within two ongoing clinical trials in our Institute ( NCT05596851 and NCT05448157 ). Pathologic assessment with immunohistochemistry (PSMA-staining and SSA immunoreactivity) was considered as standard of truth. Specimen images were compared with baseline PET/CT images and histopathological analysis. Results: Patients received 1 MBq/Kg of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 (PCa) or 1.2 MBq/Kg of 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC (NET) prior to surgery. Specimens were collected, positioned in the dedicated specimen container, and scanned to obtain high-resolution PET/CT images. In all cases, a perfect match was observed between the findings detected by the specimen imager and histopathology. Overall, the PET spatial resolution was sensibly higher for the specimen images compared to the baseline whole-body PET/CT images. Furthermore, the use of the PET/CT specimen imager did not significantly interfere with any procedures, and the overall length of the surgery was not affected using the PET/CT specimen imager. Finally, the radiation exposure of the operating theater staff was lower than 40 µSv per procedure (range 26-40 μSv). Conclusions: the image acquisition of specimens obtained by patients who received intra-surgery injections of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 and 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC was feasible and reliable also in a live-experience session and has been easily adapted to surgery daily practice. The high sensitivity, together with the evaluation of intra-lesion tumor heterogeneity, were the most relevant results since the data derived from specimen PET/CT imaging matched perfectly with the histopathological analysis.

(Before amino acid nephroprotection, ondansetron, methylprednisolone and metoclopramid, are given intravenously in order to prevent nausea or vomiting). Approximately 30 min after the beginning of the amino acid solution, 177Lu-octreotate is co-infused over 15-30 minutes. The amino acid infusion is continued at the same rate for 3-5 more hours (total infusion lasts 4-6 hours).\n\nIn total, 4 cycles (= injections of 177Lu-octreotate) are planned. However, the total number of administered cycles will be limited by critical organ (kidneys and bone marrow) threshold toxicities.\n\nTreatment efficacy will be assessed:\n\n* on a lesion-basis (change of longest transversal diameter).\n* on a patient-basis using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.",

Methods: This prospective study included patients with progressive GEP-NETs. Treatment consisted of 4 cycles of 7.4 GBq of 177 Lu-DOTATATE. Imaging parameters were measured on 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT (SUV max/mean , somatostatin receptor [SSTR] tumor volume [TV], total lesion SSTR expression, and tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-spleen ratios), 18 F-FDG PET/CT (SUV max/mean , metabolically active TV, and total lesion glycolysis), and diffusion-weighted MRI (apparent diffusion coefficient) in a maximum of 5 target lesions per patient at approximately 10 wk after each injection. Tumor dosimetry was performed using SPECT/CT at 3 time points for every cycle. Baseline imaging parameters, their relative changes after PRRT cycle 1 (C1), and the tumor-absorbed dose at C1 were correlated with lesion morphologic outcome. The average values of the imaging parameters and the minimal, maximal, and mean C1 tumor-absorbed dose in each patient were tested for association with progression-free survival (PFS) and best objective response (RECIST 1.1). Results: In the 37 patients, the median PFS was 28 mo. Eleven of the 37 (30%) achieved a partial response (RECIST 1.1). After a median follow-up of 57 mo, the median time to lesion progression had not been reached in 84 morphologically evaluable lesions, with only 12 (14%) progressing (size increase ≥ 20% from baseline). Patients receiving a minimal C1 dose of 35 Gy in all target lesions exhibited a significantly longer PFS (48.1 vs. 26.2 mo; hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.17-0.82; P = 0.02). Volumetric 68 Ga-DOTATATE PET parameters correlated with lesion and patient outcome: patients with an SSTR TV decrease of more than 10% after C1 had a longer PFS (51.3 vs. 22.8 mo; hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.16-0.75; P = 0.003). There was no statistical evidence of an association between other dosimetric or imaging parameters and the lesion or patient outcome. Conclusion: Minimal tumor-absorbed dose at C1 is predictive of outcome in patients with GEP-NETs treated with PRRT, providing a basis for personalized dosimetry-guided treatment strategies. An SSTR TV decrease after C1 could be used for early therapy response assessment as a predictor of PRRT outcome. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01842165 .

Patients and methods: Thirty-seven patients with GEP-NETs underwent 177 Lu-DOTATATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in a single-arm, prospective, phase 2 study, where patients were followed up with blood tests, isotopic glomerular filtration rate (iGFR), and imaging examinations (CT/MRI and PET) every 6 months until disease progression. Adverse events (AEs) graded per CTCAEv4.03 and occurring during treatment were collected and followed up until resolution. Dosimetry, including biologically effective doses (BEDs) to kidneys, BED to bone marrow, and absorbed dose (AD) to spleen, was performed after each PRRT cycle. Statistical analyses explored associations among dosimetry, toxicity, and patient progression free-survival. Results: The most common AEs were anemia and lymphopenia (65%), followed by thrombocytopenia and fatigue (each 51%), alopecia (46%), and nausea (41%). The most common grade ≥3 AE was lymphopenia (43%). There was no grade ≥3 nephrotoxicity. The median iGFR % decrease was 11% ( P < 0.001), at a median follow-up of 23 months. iGFR %decrease and renal BED did not correlate (Spearman ρ = -0.09). Similarly, no significant association was found between bone marrow BED or spleen AD and the grades of hematological toxicities. We observed no association between progression free-survival and either the decline of renal function or the occurrence of hematological toxicities during PRRT. Conclusions: This study confirms the safety profile of 177 Lu-DOTATATE PRRT in patients with GEP-NETs irrespective of the dosimetry of organs at risk. Kidney, bone marrow, and spleen dosimetry measures were not associated with renal or hematological toxicity. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01842165 .

Its treatment protocol is currently standardised for all patients, resulting in different patient outcomes. This study investigates the variability of tumours and organs-at-risk (kidneys and red marrow) dosimetric parameters across treatment cycles in patients with pancreatic and intestinal NETs. Data from 37 patients enrolled in a prospective phase II study (LuMEn) were analysed. Treatment consisted of four cycles of [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE administered 8-12 weeks apart. Three-time-point SPECT/CT imaging was performed after each treatment cycle, and dosimetry of tumours and organs-at-risk (kidneys and red marrow) was conducted following the medical internal radiation dose formalism. Coefficients of variation (CoV) assessed the variability of absorbed doses, activity concentrations on day 1, and effective half-lives. Linear mixed effect models (SAS software) were used to investigate the evolution of the dosimetric parameters over cycles, discerning between different primary NET types and grades of tumours. Results: There is an important variability in absorbed doses and activity concentrations among patients, particularly in tumours (CoV: ~50%). Tumour absorbed doses and activity concentrations decreased over treatment cycles in pancreatic NETs, although at a limited rate (~-13%/cycle). An opposite trend was observed for the kidneys ( ~ + 8%/cycle). Effective half-lives remained relatively constant across cycles for both organs-at-risk and tumours. The primary NET type significantly influenced effective half-lives in tumours, shorter in pancreatic NETs than intestinal NETs (77 h vs. 107 h, p < 0.0001). No significant effect of the grade was observed on either of the variables investigated. Conclusions: Our study revealed considerable variations in tumour absorbed doses among patients with NETs treated with a standardized protocol. These findings confirm the need for personalized dosimetry approaches in PRRT, considering patient and tumour characteristics. Trial registration: EudraCT Number: 2012-003666-41.

The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) (RECIST v1.1). Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and toxicity were secondary endpoints. Sixteen patients with advanced/metastatic BCC were evaluable. The ORR was 31% (95% CI, 19-50%), and the 12-month OS, 75% (95% CI, 57-100%). Median PFS was 9.3 months (95% CI, 3.3-NA). Of 15 patients evaluable for clinical benefit, five partial responses (PRs) and five stable disease >6 months (total = 10/15 (66.7%)) were seen. The most common toxicities included fatigue (37.5%), pruritis (31.3%), and diarrhea (25%). In patients with advanced/metastatic BCC, ipilimumab and nivolumab produced an ORR of 31% and prolonged (>6 months) PFS in 73% of patients, with seven PFS/iPFS of >1 year, including one with prior anti-PD-1.

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Most pituitary adenomas (PAs) are considered benign tumors, but approximately 0.2% can present metastasis and are classified as pituitary carcinomas (PCs). Refractory PAs lie between benign adenomas and true malignant PC and are defined as aggressive-invasive PAs characterized by a high Ki-67 index, rapid growth, frequent recurrence, and resistance to conventional treatments, including temozolomide. It is notoriously difficult to manage refractory PAs and PC because of the limited therapeutic options. As a promising therapeutic approach, cancer immunotherapy has been experimentally used for the treatment of many tumors, including pituitary tumors. The purpose of this review is to report the progress of immunotherapy in pituitary tumors, including refractory PAs and PCs. The tumor immune microenvironment has been recognized as a key contributor to tumorigenesis, progression, and prognosis. One study indicated that the number of CD68+ macrophages was positively correlated with tumor size and Knosp classification grade for tumor invasiveness. The infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was relatively scant in these adenomas, but pituitary growth hormone (GH) adenomas exhibited significantly more CD4+ and CD8+ T cells than non-GH adenomas. These results suggest an association of CD68+ macrophage infiltration with an increase in pituitary tumor size and invasiveness. Another study suggested that a lower number of CD8+ lymphocytes is associated with cavernous sinus invasion and resistance to treatment with first-generation somatostatin analogs in acromegaly patients, highlighting a potential role of the tumor immune microenvironment in determining the prognosis of somatotroph pituitary tumors. Preclinical studies have indicated that widely varying degrees of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are found among different subtypes. Functional PAs and aggressive PAs express significantly higher levels of PD-L1 and TILs than other subtypes, indicating that PD-1 blockade might be a promising alternative therapy for patients with aggressive PAs. PD-L1 transcript and protein levels were found to be significantly increased in functioning (GH and prolactin-expressing) pituitary tumors compared to nonfunctioning (null cell and silent gonadotroph) adenomas. Moreover, primary pituitary tumors harbored higher levels of PD-L1 mRNA than recurrent tumors. These findings suggest the possibility of considering checkpoint blockade immunotherapy for functioning pituitary tumors refractory to conventional management. Animal models of Cushing's disease also demonstrated PD-L1 and TIL expression in cultured tumors and murine models, as well as the effectiveness of checkpoint blockade therapy in reducing the tumor mass, decreasing hormone secretion, and increasing the survival rate. Clinical studies show that immunotherapy may be an effective treatment in patients with pituitary tumors. One corticotroph carcinoma patient showed a significant reduction in hormone levels and shrinkage of the tumor size of primary and metastatic lesions immediately after investigational treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab. However, another patient with corticotroph adenoma progressed rapidly after four cycles of anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) treatment. To date, there are two registered clinical trials of immunotherapy for pituitary tumors. One of them is the phase II clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab for patients with aggressive pituitary tumors ( NCT04042753 ). The other one is also a phase II clinical trial of the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab for rare tumors, including pituitary tumors ( NCT02834013 ). Both clinical trials are in the stage of recruiting patients and have not been completed. In summary, the results from preclinical research and clinical studies indicated that immunotherapy might be a promising alternative therapy for PCs and refractory PAs resistant to conventional treatments. The combination of immunotherapy and radiotherapy or temozolomide may have synergistic effects compared to a single treatment. More preclinical and clinical studies are needed to further indicate the exact efficacy of immunotherapy in pituitary tumors.

Here they sought to validate their findings in a dedicated prospective cohort of high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms within S1609. Methods: A prospective, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 clinical trial of ipilimumab plus nivolumab was conducted across multiple rare tumor cohorts. The dedicated, high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasm cohort was examined here. The primary end point was the ORR according to version 1.1 of the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Results: Nineteen patients with high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms (defined by local pathology review) were enrolled in this cohort of S1609. The most common primary sites were unknown primaries (21%), which were followed by the rectum, gastroesophageal junction, cervix, and pancreas (11%). The median number of lines of prior therapy was 1 (range, 0-3). All patients were microsatellite-stable. The median Ki-67 value was 80%. The ORR was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11%-45%), and the clinical benefit rate (stable disease for ≥6 months plus partial responses plus complete responses) was 32% (95% CI, 13%-57%). The 6-month PFS rate was 32% (95% CI, 16%-61%) with a median PFS of 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.8 months to ∞) and a median OS of 8.7 months (95% CI, 6.1 months to ∞). The most common toxicities were fatigue (32%) and rash (26%), and the most common grade 3/4 immune-related adverse event was rash (15%); there were no events that required treatment discontinuation and no grade 5 events. Conclusions: Ipilimumab plus nivolumab demonstrated a 26% ORR in patients with high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms, with durable responses seen in patients with refractory disease.

We report the results of the (nonpancreatic) neuroendocrine neoplasm cohort of SWOG S1609 dual anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 blockade in rare tumors (DART). Patients and methods: We performed a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase II clinical trial of ipilimumab plus nivolumab across multiple rare tumor cohorts, with the (nonpancreatic) neuroendocrine cohort reported here. Response assessment by grade was not prespecified. The primary endpoint was overall response rate [ORR; RECIST v1.1; complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)]; secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), stable disease >6 months, and toxicity. Results: Thirty-two eligible patients received therapy; 18 (56%) had high-grade disease. Most common primary sites were gastrointestinal (47%; N = 15) and lung (19%; N = 6). The overall ORR was 25% [95% confidence interval (CI) 13-64%; CR, 3%, N = 1; PR, 22%, N = 7]. Patients with high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma had an ORR of 44% (8/18 patients) versus 0% in low/intermediate grade tumors (0/14 patients; P = 0.004). The 6-month PFS was 31% (95% CI, 19%-52%); median OS was 11 months (95% CI, 6-∞). The most common toxicities were hypothyroidism (31%), fatigue (28%), and nausea (28%), with alanine aminotransferase elevation (9%) as the most common grade 3/4 immune-related adverse event, and no grade 5 events. Conclusions: Ipilimumab plus nivolumab demonstrated a 44% ORR in patients with nonpancreatic high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, with 0% ORR in low/intermediate grade disease.

Isolated reports suggest immune checkpoint inhibition efficacy in angiosarcoma, but no prospective studies have been published. We report results for angiosarcoma treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab as a cohort of an ongoing rare cancer study. Methods: This is a prospective, open-label, multicenter phase II clinical trial of ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 weeks) plus nivolumab (240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) for metastatic or unresectable angiosarcoma. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include progression-free (PFS) and overall survival, and toxicity. A two-stage design was used. Results: Overall, there were 16 evaluable patients. Median age was 68 years (range, 25-81); median number of prior lines of therapy, 2. Nine patients had cutaneous and seven non-cutaneous primary tumors. ORR was 25% (4/16). Sixty per cent of patients (3/5) with primary cutaneous scalp or face tumors attained a confirmed response. Six-month PFS was 38%. Altogether, 75% of patients experienced an adverse event (AE) (at least possibly related to drug) (25% grade 3-4 AE); 68.8%, an immune-related AE (irAE) (2 (12.5%), grade 3 or 4 irAEs (alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase increase and diarrhea)). There were no grade 5 toxicities. One of seven patients in whom tumor mutation burden (TMB) was assessed showed a high TMB (24 mutations/mb); that patient achieved a partial response (PR). Two of three patients with PDL1 immunohistochemistry assessed had high PDL1 expression; one achieved a PR. Conclusion: The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab demonstrated an ORR of 25% in angiosarcoma, with three of five patients with cutaneous tumors of the scalp or face responding. Ipilimumab and nivolumab warrant further investigation in angiosarcoma. Trial registration number: NCT02834013 .

Abstract Background: RECIST criteria for progressive disease, partial response, and complete response, reflecting +20%, -30%, and -100% tumor size changes, respectively, are critical outcome variables in oncology clinical trials. Herein, we evaluated post-immunotherapy tumor size change correlation with outcomes. Methods: We used a unique clinical trial data resource, a multicenter basket trial in patients with rare solid tumors treated with nivolumab (anti-PD-1) and ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) between 2017 and 2023 (National Cancer Institute/Southwest Oncology Group-sponsored DART trial [ NCT02834013 ]) (open at 1083 sites at its peak). Outcome associations were evaluated by survival analysis techniques including Martingale residuals. Results: In 638 evaluable patients, we found strong linear relationships between percent change in tumor measurement up to a 40%-50% increase and progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) (both Cox regression P < .001; landmark analyses based on day 65). Pearson R correlation between survival estimates and tumor change category were -0.94, -0.89, and -0.89 (PFS) and -0.84, -0.90, and -0.90 (OS) for median, 6-month (PFS), and 1-year (OS) and for 1-year (PFS) and 2-year (OS) estimates. Conclusions: Percent change in tumor measurement per RECISTv1.1 (the sum of longest dimensions of target lesions) has a linear association with PFS and OS up to a 40% to 50% increase in tumor measurement in this cohort of patients with rare cancers who received combination immune checkpoint blockade. Quantitative first scan tumor measurement changes include important information to evaluate the potential efficacy of a therapy beyond the proportion of patients who achieve an objective response. © The Author(s) 2024.

Martingale residual plots for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). For each patient, their residual is equal to the difference between their event indicator (equal to 0 if censored, equal to 1 otherwise) and the probability of an event at their censoring or event time (probability based on calculated cumulative incidence). The largest value the residual can take is 1. Censored patients with long follow-up will have more negative residuals. These figures illustrate that there is a linear relationship between PFS and OS and change in tumor size, up to a ∼40%-50% increase in tumor size. Inflection points in outcome are not seen at +20%, -30%, or -100% (corresponding to progressive disease, partial response, and complete response, respectively). Figure 3.

We report the results of the adrenocortical carcinoma cohort of NCI/SWOG S1609 Dual Anti-CTLA-4 and Anti-PD-1 blockade in Rare Tumors. Design/setting: A prospective, phase 2 clinical trial of ipilimumab plus nivolumab was conducted by the SWOG Early Therapeutics and Rare Cancers Committee for multiple rare tumor cohorts across >1,000 National Clinical Trial Network sites. Participants: 21 eligible patients were registered. Median age was 53 years (range 26-69); 16 (76%) were women. Interventions: Ipilimumab 1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 weeks with nivolumab 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks was administered until disease progression, symptomatic deterioration, treatment delay for any reason >56 days, unacceptable or immune-related toxicity with inability to decrease prednisone to <10 mg daily, or per patient request. Main outcome measures: The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) (RECIST V.1.1). Secondary endpoints include clinical benefit rate (CBR) (includes stable disease (SD)>6 months), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Immune-related outcomes included immune ORR (iORR), immune CBR (iCBR), and immune PFS (iPFS). A two-stage design was used assuming: null=5% alternative=30%, n=6 in the first stage, 16 max, one-sided alpha=13%. Results: The median number of prior therapy lines was 2 (range: 1-9). 3 of 21 patients attained confirmed partial response (PR) (ORR=14%). In addition, one patient had an unconfirmed PR; one, stable disease (SD)>6 months; one, immune-related RECIST (iRECIST) PR (iPR); and one patient attained iSD>6 months: clinical benefit rate (response or SD>6 months)=5/21 (24%), iORR=4/21 (19%), iCBR=7/21 (33%). The 6-month PFS was 24%; 6-month iPFS, 33%. The PFS for patients (N=7) with iRECIST clinical benefit were 57, 52, 18, 15, 13, 7, and 7 months. The 6-month OS was 76%; the median OS, was 15.8 months. The most common toxicities were fatigue (62%) and rash (38%), and the most common grade 3/4 immune-related adverse events were hepatic dysfunction (9.5%) and adrenal insufficiency (9.5%). Treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy in four patients (21%). There were no grade 5 adverse events. Conclusions: Ipilimumab plus nivolumab is active in refractory metastatic adrenocortical cancer meeting the primary endpoint of the study, with a 19% iORR and 33% iCBR (includes SD/iSD>6 months) and with the longest PFS/iPFS of 52 and 57 months.

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Introduction: Most patients with advanced gallbladder cancer are treated with multiagent chemotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors offer the possibility of a durable response with less toxicity. This prospective, multicenter, open-label study was designed to evaluate the anticancer activity of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with advanced gallbladder cancer. Methods: Nineteen patients with advanced gallbladder cancer refractory to ≥1 previous therapy received nivolumab 240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks and ipilimumab 1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was confirmed radiographic overall response rate (ORR) (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR] confirmed on subsequent scan); secondary end points included unconfirmed overall response, clinical benefit rate (confirmed and unconfirmed responses + stable disease >6 months), progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. Results: The confirmed ORR was 16% (CR, n = 1 [5%]; PR, n = 2 [11%]); all were microsatellite stable, and the confirmed CR had undetectable programmed death-ligand 1 by immunohistochemistry. The unconfirmed ORR and clinical benefit rates were both 32%. The median duration of response was 14.8 months (range, 4-35.1+ months). The 6-month progression-free survival was 26% (95% CI, 12-55). The median overall survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 3.9-19.1). The most common toxicities were fatigue (32%), anemia (26%), and anorexia (26%). Aspartate aminotransferase elevation was the most common grade 3/4 toxicity (11%). There was 1 possibly related death (sepsis with attendant hepatic failure). Conclusions: Ipilimumab plus nivolumab was well tolerated and showed modest efficacy with durable responses in previously treated patients with advanced gallbladder cancer. Clinical trial registration: NCT02834013 (ClincialTrials.gov). Plain language summary: This prospective study assessed the efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in 19 patients with advanced gallbladder cancer refractory to previous therapy. The combination demonstrated modest efficacy with a 16% confirmed overall response rate, durable responses, and manageable toxicities, suggesting potential benefits for this challenging patient population.

However, its efficacy in rare solid cancers remains unclear. Desmoid tumors are ultrarare soft-tissue tumors, traditionally treated with surgery. This study reviews the first results of using ipilimumab and nivolumab in the desmoid tumor cohort of the SWOG S1609 Dual Anti-CTLA-4 & Anti-PD-1 blockade in Rare Tumors (DART) trial. Methods: DART is a prospective/open-label/multicenter (1,016 US sites)/multicohort phase II trial of ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously every 6 weeks) plus nivolumab (240 mg intravenously every 2 weeks) that opened at 1,016 US sites. The primary endpoint included overall response rate (ORR) defined as confirmed complete (CR) and partial responses (PR) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR; stable disease (SD) ≥6 months plus CR and PR) and toxicity. Results: Sixteen evaluable patients (median age: 37) with desmoid tumors and a median of 1.5 prior therapies (with no prior exposure to immunotherapy) were analyzed. The tumors varied in location (eight abdomen, three lower limb, two upper limb, two pelvis, and one neck). ORR was 18.8% (3/16; 3 confirmed PR): 40% regression (PFS 30+ months), 83% regression (PFS 16 months) and 71% regression (PFS 8.4 months). Seven additional patients (43.8%) had prolonged SD over 6 months (PFS: 16.5, 22.4+, 22.6, 30.1, 38.2+, 48.3+ and 60.7+ months). Overall CBR was 62.5% (10/16). Median PFS was 19.4 months, with 6-month PFS of 73% and 1-year PFS of 67%. All patients were alive at 1 year; median OS was not assessable, as 13 patients were alive at analysis. Common adverse events included fatigue, nausea and hypothyroidism, with 50% experiencing grade 3-4 events. There were no grade 5 events. Conclusion: Treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab in desmoid tumors yielded an ORR of 18.8% and a CBR of 62.5% with durable responses seen. This is the first prospective study exploring the efficacy of this combination in this rare disease. Ongoing studies aim to identify markers for response and resistance.

Objectives: This study presents the first results of ipilimumab-nivolumab in invasive mucinous or non-mucinous lepidic adenocarcinoma (invasive mucinous adenocarcinoma (IMA) or invasive non-mucinous lepidic adenocarcinomas (INLA), respectively) of the lung. Design: Dual anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 blockade in rare tumors (DART) is a prospective, open-label, multicenter (1016 US sites), multi-cohort phase II trial of ipilimumab (1 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 6 weeks) plus nivolumab (240 mg IV every 2 weeks). Methods: Participants histologically diagnosed with advanced IMA or INLA, who had not responded to at least one line of therapy, were included in the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma cohort. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (confirmed complete and partial responses (CR and PR)). Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical benefit rate (CBR; stable disease (SD) ⩾ 6 months plus ORR), and toxicity. Results: Eight evaluable patients (median age: 77 years; the number of prior therapies ranged from 0 to 4; one patient with prior exposure to a PD-1 inhibitor; comprising six IMA and two INLA) were treated. One IMA had a 40% regression (PFS 45.2+ months, PD-L1 0%, KRAS G12C mutated, tumor mutational burden [TMB] 13 mut/Mb). One INLA had 66% regression (PFS 23.8 months, PD-L1 unknown, no actionable mutations, TMB 3 mut/Mb). Overall ORR was 25.0% (2/8) and CBR, 62.5% (5/8); PFS for the patients with SD > 6 months was 43.4+, 11.7+, and 8.3 months. The median PFS was 16 months (5.3-not reached) and the median OS was 32.2 months (14.6-not reached). The toxicity profile was similar to previous reports. Conclusion: Ipilimumab plus nivolumab in the bronchioloalveolar carcinoma cohort (IMA, INLA) resulted in a durable ORR of 25.0% and CBR of 62.5% (PFS, 8.3 11.7+. 23.8 (PR), 43.4+ and 45.2+ (PR) months). Correlative studies to determine response and resistance markers are ongoing. Expanded prospective studies are warranted. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT02834013 .

      "brief_summary": "There is currently no standard treatment beyond first-line etoposide/platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with progressive poorly differentiated extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma. Therefore the treatment of patients whose disease progresses on or after this first-line treatment is an area of unmet need.\n\nCombination regimens such as irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid are a second-line treatment option currently used in Europe and world-wide for this subset of patients. However, there is currently no trial evidence supporting this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\nResults of the NAPOLI-1 phase III trial of liposomal irinotecan in the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma after gemcitabine-based therapy reported improved survival for those patients who received a combination of liposomal irinotecan with 5-FU/folinic acid compared to those patients who received 5-FU/folinic acid alone. Liposomal irinotecan has been found to show an improved distribution into tumour tissue in comparison to irinotecan, and this may have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nDocetaxel is standardly used as a second-line treatment option in patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed on primary etoposide-platinum combination therapy. Therefore this drug could also have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma as the biology of the disease is similar to small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe overall aim of the NET-02 trial is to select a treatment for continuation to a Phase III trial. The intention of the trial is to determine whether liposomal irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid and docetaxel are sufficiently active in this population of patients. If both treatments are found to be efficacious, selection criteria will be applied to select a treatment to take forward.\n\n102 eligible participants will be randomised to receive either liposomal irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid given every 14 days, or docetaxel given every 21 days. Participants will be treated for a minimum of 6 months or until discontinuation of treatment as per protocol.",

First-line treatment for advanced disease is an etoposide and platinum-based chemotherapy combination. There is no established second-line treatment for patients with PD-EP-NEC, and this is an area of unmet need. Methods and analysis: NET-02 is a UK, multicentre, randomised (1:1), parallel group, open-label, phase II, single-stage selection trial of liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI)/5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/folinic acid or docetaxel as second-line therapy in patients with progressive PD-EP-NEC. One hundred and two eligible participants will be randomised to receive either nal-IRI/5-FU/folinic acid or docetaxel. The primary objective is to determine the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine PFS, overall survival, objective response rate, toxicity, quality of life and whether neuron-specific enolase is predictive of treatment response. If either treatment is found to have a 6-month PFS rate of at least 25%, that treatment will be considered for a phase III trial. If both treatments meet this target, prespecified selection criteria will be applied to establish which treatment to take forward. Ethics and dissemination: This study has ethical approval from the Greater Manchester Central Research Ethics Committee (reference no. 18/NW/0031) and clinical trial authorisation from the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and uploaded to the European Union Clinical Trials Register.

A recognised first-line (1L) treatment for advanced disease is etoposide/platinum-based chemotherapy with no standard second-line (2L) treatment. Methods: Patients with histologically-confirmed PD-EP-NEC (Ki-67 > 20%; Grade 3) received IV liposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) (70 mg/m 2 free base)/5-FU (2400 mg/m 2 )/folinic acid, Q14 days (ARM A), or IV docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 ), Q21 days (ARM B), as 2L therapy. Primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate (80% power to demonstrate one-sided 95% lower confidence interval excluded 15% (target level of efficacy: 30%)). Secondary endpoints: objective response rate (ORR), median PFS, overall survival (OS), toxicity and patient-reported quality-of-life (QoL) (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03837977 ). Findings: Of 58 patients (29 each arm); 57% male, 90% ECOG PS 0/1, 10% PS 2, 89.7% Ki-67 ≥ 55%, primary site: 70.7%-gastrointestinal, 18.9%-other, 10.3%-unknown, 91.4%/6.9%/1.7% were resistant/sensitive/intolerant to 1L platinum-based treatment, respectively. The primary end-point of 6-month PFS rate was met by ARM A: 29.6% (lower 95% Confidence-Limit (CL) 15.7), but not by ARM B: 13.8% (lower 95%CL:4.9). ORR, median PFS and OS were 11.1% (95%CI:2.4-29.2) and 10.3% (95%CI:2.2-27.4%); 3 months (95%CI:2-6) and 2 months (95%CI:2-2); and 6 months (95%CI:3-10) and 6 months (95%CI:3-9) in ARMS A and B, respectively. Adverse events ≥ grade 3 occurred in 51.7% and 55.2% (1 and 6 discontinuations due to toxicity in ARMS A and B), respectively. QoL was maintained in ARM A, but not ARM B. Interpretation: nal-IRI/5-FU/folinic acid, but not docetaxel, met the primary endpoint, with manageable toxicity and maintained QoL, with no difference in OS. ORR and median PFS were similar in both arms. This study provides prospective efficacy, toxicity and QoL data in the 2L setting in a disease group of unmet need, and represents some of the strongest evidence available to recommend systemic treatment to these patients.

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leuprolide, apalutamide, and abiraterone acetate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving antiandrogen therapy and SBRT may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer.",

This post hoc analysis of two prospective phase 2 trials, SOLAR ( NCT03298087 ) and SATURN ( NCT03902951 ), evaluated oncologic outcomes in prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography-defined synchronous and metachronous omCSPC (≤5 M1a-b lesions), respectively. All patients received 6 mo of intensified systemic therapy (leuprolide, abiraterone acetate with prednisone, and apalutamide) and stereotactic body radiotherapy to oligometastases. SOLAR patients were treatment-naïve and also underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or definitive prostate-directed radiotherapy (dRT). SATURN enrolled patients with post-RP recurrences: among the 26 patients who completed protocol therapy, 12 (46%) had prior androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), six (23%) had prior MDT, and 17 (65%) had one to three prior recurrences. The primary endpoint for both studies was prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, defined as <0.05 ng/ml after RP or <2 ng/ml after dRT at 6 mo after testosterone recovery (≥150 ng/dl). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and eugonadal PFS starting from the time of testosterone recovery. Progression was determined biochemically using PSA thresholds of ≥0.05 ng/ml for post-RP and ≥2 ng/ml for post-dRT patients. Among 50 patients (24 synchronous and 26 metachronous), the synchronous omCSPC group had a significantly higher PSA response rate (83% vs 50%; p = 0.018) and significantly longer PFS and eugonadal PFS (p < 0.05). The metachronous subgroup with prior ADT had worse outcomes, suggesting increasing resistance with repeated systemic therapy.

                "full_content": "Full text links Cite Display options Display options Format Abstract PubMed PMID Abstract Nearly all men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with intermittent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) experience recurrence within 6 mo of testosterone recovery. We conducted a single-arm phase 2 trial to evaluate whether addition of dual androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and metastasis-directed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to intermittent ADT improves recurrence rates for men with between one and five nonvisceral, extrapelvic metastases on prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography after prior radical prostatectomy. Patients received 6 mo of androgen annihilation therapy (AAT; leuprolide, abiraterone acetate plus prednisone, and apalutamide) and metastasis-directed SBRT. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <0.05 ng/ml 6 mo after testosterone recovery (≥150 ng/dl), with the study powered to detect an improvement from 1% to 12%. We enrolled 28 men between March 2021 and June 2022. Median follow-up was 20 mo (interquartile range 16-22). Twenty-six patients (93%) completed SBRT with 6 mo of hormone therapy, of whom six discontinued at least one ARPI; two patients withdrew prematurely. At 6 mo after testosterone recovery, PSA was maintained at <0.05 ng/ml in 13/26 patients (50%, 95% confidence interval 32-67%). Rates of grade 2 and 3 AAT toxicity were 21% and 21%. The results confirm that addition of metastasis-directed SBRT to highly potent systemic therapy can maintain low PSA after testosterone recovery, although further studies are needed to clarify the optimal systemic therapy regimen. PATIENT SUMMARY: We tested a combination of intensified hormone therapy (called androgen annihilation therapy) and radiotherapy targeted at metastases in men with recurrence of metastatic prostate cancer. We found that half of patients were recurrence-free 6 months after their testosterone level recovered, and that less than a quarter of patients experienced a severe drug-related side effect. Overall, this appears to be an effective therapy with acceptable side effects. This trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03902951 .
