In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors have activity against a variety of tumor types. Carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor with a favorable safety profile that has been studied in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. Carfilzomib received accelerated approval from the U.S. FDA in 2012, based on a favorable response rate, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who received at least two prior therapies, and demonstrated disease progression within 60 days of completing the last therapy. In this multi-center study, the investigators propose to evaluate carfilzomib for the treatment of patients with advanced neuroendocrine cancers.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well berzosertib (M6620) works when given in combination with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) compared with topotecan alone in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has come back (relapsed), or small cell cancer that arises from a site other than the lung (extrapulmonary). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work by damaging the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in tumor cells, causing those cells to die and the tumor to shrink. However, some tumor cells can become less affected by chemotherapy because they have ways to repair the damaged DNA. The addition of M6620 could help topotecan hydrochloride shrink the cancer and prevent it from returning by blocking enzymes needed for DNA repair.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if the combination of berzosertib (M6620) with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) will result in an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to topotecan alone in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) with the combination of M6220 and topotecan in patients with relapsed SCLC and extrapulmonary small cell cancers.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not limited to ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNA-Seq):\n\nIa. To assess expression of genes Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11), MYC, and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) among others.\n\nIb. To identify potential predictive biomarkers of response to a combination of M6620 with topotecan.\n\nIc. Identify mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- and RNA-based assessment platforms.\n\nII. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.\n\nIII. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients at the Early-Phase and Experimental Clinical Trials (EET) Biobank at Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n\nIV. To characterize circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells in patients with relapsed SCLC and extrapulmonary small cell cancers.\n\nV. To identify potential predictive biomarkers of response to a combination of M6620 with topotecan in patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Patient with SCLC are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Participants receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants may crossover to Arm II at disease progression. Participants undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan during screening and on study as well as a tumor biopsy during screening. Participants may also undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Participants receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and berzosertib (M6620) IV over 60 minutes on days 2 and 5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants undergo a CT scan during screening and on study as well as a tumor biopsy during screening. Participants may also undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nCOHORT II (Patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancer): Participants receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and berzosertib (M6620) IV over 60 minutes on days 2 and 5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants undergo a CT scan during screening and on study as well as a tumor biopsy during screening. Participants may also undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients enrolled to the primary cohort must have limited- or extensive-disease SCLC at diagnosis, with relapse at study entry with measurable disease at random assignment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients will be included\n* Patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers (cancers with small cell morphology and arising outside the lung, such as small cell prostate, bladder, etc.) will be eligible for the exploratory cohort\n* Patients must be \\>= 18 years of age because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of M6620 in combination with topotecan in patients \\<18 years of age\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\\< 2 (Karnofsky \\>= 60%)\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 9.0 g/dL - patients may receive transfusion to meet the hemoglobin (Hb) eligibility\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/mcL\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 2 mg/dL\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 3.0 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Creatinine =\\< institutional ULN OR\n* Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \\>= 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 unless data exists supporting safe use at lower kidney function values, no lower than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are eligible as long as they are on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months and there is no drug-drug interaction with M6220\n* For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n* Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis are not eligible due to their extremely poor prognosis and since it is unclear whether the investigational agent penetrates the blood-brain barrier. However, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days may be enrolled\n* Patients who have received prior topotecan therapy\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n  * Note: Patients who have had palliative radiotherapy may be included as long as they have recovered from any radiotherapy related adverse events (allow at least a week between radiotherapy completion and study treatment)\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy except hair loss and peripheral neuropathy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1)\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to M6620 or topotecan used in study\n* M6620 is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) should be avoided. Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or of which to minimize use. The Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card should be provided to patients. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 as a DDR inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620. These potential risks may also apply to topotecan used in this study\n* Patients with high grade neuroendocrine cancers, but with no small cell morphology will not be eligible\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome will not be eligible",

Evaluate the best overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (investigator-reported).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n1. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab-based therapy in this patient population.\n2. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in participants receiving pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.\n3. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in participants treated with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (median PFS and 18 wk PFS).\n4. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in participants receiving pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPart A: Participants are treated with pembrolizumab alone. An adaptive Simon's two-stage design was used, and the overall plan hinges on the activity of single agent pembrolizumab in the first stage of Part A. If there is sufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will expand to the second stage of Part A and forgo Part B. If there is insufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will proceed to the first stage of Part B (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy).\n\nPart B: Participants are treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (physician's choice, paclitaxel or irinotecan). Patients with stable disease (SD) or better after 9 cycles (27 weeks) of pembrolizumab-based therapy will have the option to continue with pembrolizumab alone, unless the first partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) is noted at 27 weeks.\n\nAll participants will undergo a pre-treatment tumor biopsy (unless the tumor is inaccessible and/or a biopsy is not felt to be in the participant's best interest). Participants may continue study treatment until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable adverse events, inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the participant, the participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, participant receives 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment.",

New options for treatment are necessary in patients with advanced thymoma and thymic carcinoma that have progressed on cisplatin-containing therapy.\n* IMC-A12 is a new (experimental) agent that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. IMC-A12 blocks the Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R). IGF-1R is found on many types of cancer cells, including cancer of the thymus, and is thought to play an important role in helping these cells to grow and divide.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To determine if IMC-A12 has an effect on tumor growth in patients with cancer of the thymus.\n* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of IMC-A12 in treatment for cancer of the thymus.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Individuals older than 18 years of age who have cancer of the thymus (thymoma, thymic carcinoma, or thymic carcinoid tumors) that has progressed in spite of standard treatment.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Treatment will take place in 21-day cycles. Patients will receive one dose of IMC-A12 intravenously once every 3 weeks at the Clinical Center. During the Clinical Center visits, researchers will perform study tests and procedures to see how the study drugs are affecting the body.\n* Patients will undergo a number of tests and procedures during the treatment cycle, including physical examinations, blood and urine samples for standard tests, imaging studies (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans) to evaluate tumor growth, and blood and urine samples to evaluate the amount of IMC-A12 in the body.\n* Patients may continue to take the drug as long as there are no adverse side effects and as long as the tumor does not grow.",

New options for treatment are necessary in patients with advanced thymoma and thymic carcinoma that have progressed on cisplatin-containing therapy. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway is being studies in various malignancies including thymoma and thymic carcinoma. IMCA12 is an anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody that has shown activity in patients with thymic malignancies.\n\nObjectives:\n\n* To determine the objective response rate (partial response (PR)+complete response (CR)) to IMC-A12 monotherapy in patients with advanced or recurrent thymoma or thymic carcinoma.\n* To evaluate time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)\n* To assess safety of IMC-A12\n* To perform immunohistochemistry for IGF1R expression on tumor samples of thymoma and thymic carcinoma (exploratory)\n* To correlate response to therapy with changes in fludeoxyglucose 18F-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging at baseline and first restaging\n* To perform pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of IMC-A12\n* To perform pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis in blood for the detection of IGF1R, AKT and pAKT in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) (exploratory).\n* To assess circulating endothelial cell, circulating endothelial progenitor cells, immune subset analysis and glucose transport in peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes (exploratory).\n* To evaluate anti-cytokine antibodies in peripheral blood (exploratory).\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients with histologically confirmed thymic carcinoma or thymoma who have previously been treated on at least one platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen\n* Measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria\n* Adequate renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function\n* No major surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy or biologic therapy within 28 days of IMC-A12 therapy\n\nDesign:\n\n* Patients will receive IMC-A12 at a dose of 20 mg/kg intravenously once every three weeks\n* Treatment with IMC-A12 alone will continue until disease progression\n* Toxicity will be assessed every cycle by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0 until December 31, 2010, and by CTCAE Version 4.0 beginning January 1, 2011\n* Tumor response assessments by RECIST 1.0 criteria will be performed every 2 cycles\n* Correlative studies including tissue immunohistochemistry studies will be done on existing tumor blocks\n* Blood samples will be collected for for PK's, PD's, circulating endothelial cells (CEC's), circulating endothelial precursor cells (CEPC's), immune subsets, glucose transport and cytokine antibodies.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n* Histologically confirmation of invasive recurrent or metastatic thymoma or thymic carcinoma by the pathology department / Center for Cancer Research (CCR) / National Cancer Institute (NCI), or the pathology department of participating institutions.\n* Patients must have had at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy regimen. There is no limit to the number of prior chemotherapy regimens received. Progressive disease should have been documented before entry into the study.\n* Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as greater than 20 mm with conventional techniques or as greater than 10 mm with spiral CT scan. See section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n* Target lesions cannot be selected within previously irradiated areas, if not newly arising or clearly progressing after irradiation as proven by repeat scanning.\n* Patients must have recovered from toxicity related to prior therapy to at least to grade 1 (defined by CTCAE 3.0 until December 31, 2010, and by CTCAE 4.0 beginning January 1, 2011) and must not have had major surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy (including any investigational agents), or hormonal therapy (other than replacement), within 4 weeks prior to entering the study.\n* Concurrent corticosteroids for myasthenia gravis, or other paraneoplastic syndromes which often accompany thymic malignancies are allowed. Inhaled steroids are also allowed. However since steroids might occasionally induce responses in thymic malignancies patients should be on a stable dose of steroids for greater than or equal to 8 weeks before enrollment in order not to confound the efficacy assessment.\n* Age greater than 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of IMC-A12 in patients less than 16 years of age, children are excluded from this study but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 1 single-agent trials.\n* Life expectancy of greater than 3 months.\n* Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) less than or equal to 2.\n* Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function (as defined below). Patients must have returned to baseline or grade 1 from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy:\n\n  * leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mm\\^3\n  * absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm\\^3\n  * hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL\n  * platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/mm\\^3\n  * total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n  * aspartate aminotransferase (AST)(SGOT)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT)(SGPT) less than or equal to 3 times the institutional ULN\n\n    (5x if LFT elevations due to liver metastases)\n  * creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 times the institutional ULN\n\nOR\n\n--creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n\n* Patients may be transfused to obtain a hemoglobin of 9.0.\n* The patient must have fasting serum glucose less than 120 mg/dL or below the institutional ULN\n* The effects of IMC-A12 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study therapy and for 3 months after the last dose of IMC-A12. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n* Ability to comply with intravenous administration schedule, and the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nINCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:\n\nBoth men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial. Every effort will be made to recruit women and minorities in this study.\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events. However, patients who have had treatment for their brain metastases and whose brain metastatic disease status has remained stable for at least 3 months without steroids may be enrolled at the discretion of the principal investigator.\n* Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate, provided their blood glucose is within the normal range (fasting less than 120 mg/dL or below institutional upper limit of normal) and if they are on a stable dietary or therapeutic regimen for this condition.\n* Uncontrolled medical illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or uncontrolled, symptomatic congestive heart failure (American Heart Association (AHA) Class II or worse), uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n* Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients with poorly controlled viral loads (viral load greater than 50 copies HIV/ml), and/or AIDS-defining illnesses will be excluded due to the possibility that IMC-A12 may worsen their condition and the likelihood that the underlying condition may obscure the attribution of adverse events with respect to IMC-A12. HIV positive patients with thymic malignancies not meeting the above criteria can be considered for inclusion in the study.\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n* History of another invasive malignancy in the last five years. Adequately treated non-invasive, non-melanoma skin cancers, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, and surgically-removed papillary thyroid cancer will be allowed.\n* Prior treatment with drugs of the IGF-1R inhibitor class.\n* Patients with tumor amenable to potentially curative therapy as assessed by the investigator.\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because IMC-A12 is a monoclonal antibody to IGF-1R with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. IgG antibody may also potentially be secreted in milk and therefore breastfeeding women should be excluded.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to IMC-A12.",

      "brief_summary": "The incidence of new diagnosed patients with NET of the digestive tract including carcinoid and pancreatic islet cells tumors ranges from 2 to 10 per 100,000 in the western Countries (Kulke M, Mayer R. N Engl J Med 340:858-868, 1999). Despite of the low incidence, the prevalence of these tumors is high because of their relatively long survival estimated in 35% at 5 years for those patients with well or moderate differentiated tumors (Yao JC, et al. J Clin Oncol. 2008;26:3063-3072). In fact, digestive NETs are the second most prevalent tumors derived from the digestive tract after colorectal carcinoma.\n\nNETs are characterized by abundant vasculature, moreover VEGFR and VEGFR are overexpressed in 60-84% of the carcinoids and pancreatic islet cells NETs (Zhang et al. Cancer 2007;109:1478-1486). Other pro-angiogenic factors like the platelet derived growth factor (PDGFR) have been also involved in NET progression and development (Chaudhry A, et al.Cancer Res 1992;52:1006-12).\n\nPazopanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the VEGFR, PDGFR and KIT with a dual activity both as an antiangiogenic and also and anti-tumoral agent (Kumar et al. Mol Cancer Ther2007;6:2012-2021, Hurwitz et al. Clin Cancer Res 2009;15:4220-4227). Pazopanib seems to have a better toxicity profile versus the other antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors and has already shown activity in several tumor types like renal cell carcinoma (Sternberg et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 5021), soft tissue sarcomas (Sleijfer et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:3126-32), hepatocellular carcinoma (Yau et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3561), colorectal cancer (Brady et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst.4133), and thyroid cancers (Bible et al. J Clin Oncol 2009;27:abst. 3521).\n\nThe Spanish Group for Research in Neuroendocrine Tumors (GETNE) group is an active Member inside of the GENET group and has a large tradition in clinical trials in NETs. The investigators hypothesize that pazopanib may have at least as good activity and better safety profile than other VEGFR inhibitors in progressive advanced or metastatic NET tumors derived from the digestive tract.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II study is designed to assess whether treatment with capecitabine/temozolomide (CAP/TEM) is safe and effective in treating subjects with progressive, differentiated, metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET). The primary objective of the study is to determine the radiologic response rate to this regimen in progressive, metastatic, differentiated neuroendocrine cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumor (NET) is a classification that has evolved over time to include a group of related tumors which all originate from neuroendocrine cells. This group includes carcinoid tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs), catecholamine-secreting tumors (e.g. pheochromocytomas), medullary carcinoma of the thyroid and small cell lung cancer. Carcinoid tumors are mostly derived from serotonin-producing enterochromaffin cells, occuring most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract (67.5%) and the bronchopulmonary system (25.3%). Pancreatic endocrine tumors (PETs) arise from the several types of pancreatic islet cells, which manifest as insulinomas, somatostatinomas or glucagonomas. NETs are broadly classified as functional or nonfunctional, as determined by whether plasma hormone elevation and endocrine symptoms occur. NETs are classified into two groups: 1) rapidly growing anaplastic small cell cancers such as small cell lung cancer and small cell carcinomas of the GI tract and 2) slow growing, more differentiated NETs such as carcinoid and PET.\n\nIn total, an estimated 12,000 - 15,000 cases of NETs (not counting small cell carcinomas) are diagnosed in the United States annually. The incidence of carcinoid tumors alone is estimated to be 2 per 100,000 in the United States (5,400 cases/yr/U.S.). PETs are less common, with about 1,000 new cases per year in the United States. Carcinoids and PETs are potentially curable by surgical resection; the 5-year survival rates in patients with localized carcinoid is 78.2%. However, these tumors are frequently indolent in their growth and patients often present with unresectable or metastatic disease (80% of all cases). The hormonal symptoms that may accompany their disease, as exemplified by carcinoid syndrome, complicate the management of these patients. Hormonal therapy, namely octreotide, is used to relieve symptoms and has been reported to have a response rate of 1-5% by itself. Metastatic disease is associated with significantly worse prognosis; carcinoid patients with visceral metastases have a 5-year survival rate of 38.5%. Based on the efficacy of the combination of cisplatin and etoposide in treating small cell lung cancer, these agents have been explored in the treatment of pancreatic islet cell tumors and carcinoids. In general, etoposide-cisplatin regimens have poor response rates for the slow growing, differentiated NET group with an average response rate of 7-10%. Furthermore, these cisplatin-etoposide regimens have been associated with significant toxicities, including frequent severe neutropenia, ototoxicity, neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity.\n\nAn Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial of patients with metastatic or unresectable progressive pancreatic islet cell tumors, including poorly and well-differentiated PETs, showed that a regimen of streptozocin and doxorubicin had a significantly superior objective response rate compared to a combination of streptozocin and fluorouracil (69 versus 45%, p=0.05). The study used a definition for objective response that included regression of the tumor mass, regression of malignant tumor causing hepatomegaly or a reduction in excessive hormone production. Streptozocin-doxorubicin was also significantly superior to streptozocin-fluorouracil in terms of median time to tumor progression and of median overall survival (2.2 versus 1.4 years, p=0.004). However, significant toxicity was associated with either streptozocin-based regimen with roughly 80% in either arm experiencing vomiting that lasted throughout the 5-day course of streptozocin per cycle. Additionally, Grade 3/4 leukopenia occurred in 25% of patients who received streptozocin-fluorouracil, with one treatment-related death secondary to leukopenia complicated by sepsis. Notably, streptozocin has significant renal toxicity causing significant proteinuria. Thus, the doubtful efficacy of streptozocin-based combinations and the significant associated toxicity has limited the role of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment of differentiated NETs.\n\nIn the lab, the investigators have found that capecitabine (5-DFUR), an oral pro-drug for 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and temozolomide were synergistic for induction of apoptosis in 2 human NET cell lines. The mechanism and pathways involved are under investigation, but it was found to be important for the synergism that temozolomide be exposed to the NET cell lines during the end of the capecitabine exposure. The team believes that the combination of temozolomide and capecitabine will prove to be an effective regimen. Our hypothesis is that the DNA damage induced by capecitabine by incorporation of 5-FdUTP into DNA and reducing thymidine pools by inhibition of thymidylate synthase via 5-FdUMP will synergistically potentiate the effect of temozolomide as an alkylator by reducing the repair activity of O6-alkylguanyl-alkyl-transferase (O6-AGAT). O6-AGAT is a DNA repair enzyme which removes temozolomide-alkylated groups from guanine. A 5-day regimen of temozolomide is vital to decreasing O6-AGAT levels by direct binding which leads to a suicide inactivation of O6-AGAT-mediated DNA repair. This saturates O6-AGAT after 23 days of temozolomide, thus allowing the last 23 days of dosing to induce alkylation of DNA and thereby induce apoptosis. The investigators found that cells with prior 5-FU exposure were more sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by temozolomide.\n\nAnother fundamental rationale and hypothesis which the investigators have developed into the synthesis of a novel regimen for NET is based upon cytokinetics and p53. NET are characteristically very slow growing, yet fatal, cancers with the great majority of them having wild type p53. Therefore, their drug resistance is probably not based upon mutational p53 causes because of the wild type p53 status but rather upon their slow cytokinetics. The best way to kill slow growing tumors with a long interval in G0 phase is with lipophilic alkylators (i.e. Temodar) and utilizing continuous exposure to antimetabolites such as Xeloda or continuous infusion 5-FU. Xeloda's half-life is 11 hrs so q 12 hr dosing is roughly equivalent to continuous infusion. The investigators believe that the hypothesis is correct and well grounded in pharmacologic and cell cycle principles.\n\nThe investigators have to date pilot experience of ten patients who received capecitabine, total of 1500 mg/m2/day/PO, for fourteen days, with temozolomide 150-200 mg/m2 given on the last five days of their course of capecitabine. All of our initial 10 patients with progressive, differentiated NET have had dramatic symptomatic pain relief and at least 75% reduction in their tumor markers. Five patients had metastatic carcinoid and 5 had metastatic pancreatic NET. All patients had progressive liver metastases, all 10 patients had failed octreotide therapy with long acting somatostatin, and 7/10 had failed prior chemotherapy regimens. One carcinoid patient had a complete response (CR) proven by surgery and is now without any tumor recurrence 22 months out from surgery and chemotherapy. Three patients had a partial response (PR) and one patient had a minor response (MR) in their liver metastases. Two other patients experienced stable disease (SD) for 6 and 8 months while on therapy. The overall response rate proven by CT or MRI scans (CR, PR and MR) is 50% to date. Overall, clinical benefit of this lab based regimen occurred in 7/10 patients (CR, PR, MR and SD). Toxicities have all been minor with none over grade 2 myelosuppression. There were no hospitalizations or complications or side effects except grade 12 nausea during temozolomide therapy. Therefore, the study seeks to evaluate the role of these two drugs in this disease.",

      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "phase": "PHASE3",
      "condition": "Carcinoid Syndrome",
      "intervention": "Lanreotide; Placebo",
      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether monthly deep subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of lanreotide Autogel (Somatuline Depot) were effective and safe in controlling diarrhoea and flushing by reducing the usage of s.c. short-acting octreotide as a rescue medication to control symptoms in subjects with carcinoid syndrome.",
      "detailed_description": "This study consisted of a Screening period, conducted up to 4 months before randomisation, followed by three phases: a 16-week, double blind (DB), randomised, placebo-controlled phase; a 32-week initial open label (IOL) phase; and a long term open label extension (LTOLE) phase.\n\nThe DB phase evaluated lanreotide Autogel versus placebo in subjects with a history of carcinoid syndrome (flushing and/or diarrhoea). This was followed by a 32-week IOL phase in which all subjects received lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks. Subjects in countries where lanreotide Autogel had not been approved for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome, who were well-controlled at the end of the 32-week IOL phase and chose to continue to receive lanreotide Autogel, were given the option of participating in a LTOLE phase. The LTOLE phase of the study was planned to end at least 2 years after the last subject had completed his/her participation in the 32-week IOL phase or when marketing approval for the treatment of symptoms of carcinoid syndrome had been obtained in the respective countries (whichever occurred first) or at any time the study was terminated by the Sponsor. The actual overall duration of the study was 6.5 years. During the LTOLE phase all subjects continued to be treated with lanreotide Autogel 120 mg every 4 weeks.\n\nThe study planned to enrol approximately 100 adult subjects worldwide. Screening continued until 115 subjects were enrolled in the study.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Subjects were eligible for participation in the study if they met the following criteria:\n\n1. At least 18 years of age at the time of first dosing.\n2. Subjects must have given signed informed consent before any study related activities were conducted.\n3. Subjects in the United States of America (USA) must have given written authorisation for the release of protected health information in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations; subjects in other countries must have provided appropriate authorisation as needed by regulatory authorities in each country.\n4. Subjects must have been willing to receive s.c. octreotide injections as rescue medication, as needed to control their symptoms, if any.\n5. If female, the subject must not have been pregnant (confirmed by negative pregnancy test) and must have had the following documented via verbally given history:\n\n   * At least 1 year postmenopausal (natural cessation of menses), or\n   * Surgically sterile (if by tubal ligation, surgery must have been performed more than 3 months prior to entry into the study), or\n   * If the subject was of childbearing potential and sexually active, she must have been using an acceptable form of contraception (oral, injected, transdermal or implanted contraceptives, diaphragm or barrier method with spermicidal and/or intrauterine device); local methods such as condoms or sponges/vaginal tablets were not acceptable forms of contraception.\n6. Subjects with a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of carcinoid tumour or, a carcinoid tumour of unknown location with liver metastases (documented biopsy), and a history of carcinoid syndrome (flushing and/or diarrhoea) who were either naïve to treatment with a somatostatin analogue (SSTa) or responsive (according to the opinion of the principal investigator) to conventional doses of Sandostatin LAR® Depot (LAR; ≤30 mg every 4 weeks) or to daily doses of ≤600 μg of s.c. octreotide.\n7. Confirmation of positive somatostatin receptor (SSTR) status by somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS; up to 6 months prior to study entry at the Screening Visit).\n8. Absence of tumour progression documented by two sequential computed tomography (CT) scans or two sequential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (≥3 months apart); the last CT or MRI scan must have been performed within 6 months of study entry (Screening Visit).\n9. Subjects previously treated with LAR, must have received their last dose of LAR at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study treatment (no later than at the Screening Visit).\n10. Be able to communicate and cooperate with the principal investigator and the staff and willing to comply with the study instructions.\n\nSubjects were excluded from entering the study for the following reasons:\n\n1. History of known allergy or hypersensitivity to investigational drug or any components of its formulation, or octreotide.\n2. History of carcinoid syndrome refractory to treatment with conventional doses of SSTa.\n3. Treatment with any other investigational drug within 30 days prior to study entry (Screening Visit) and/or at any time during the subject's participation in the study.\n4. Treatment with interferon, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (a radiolabelled SSTa) and/or tumour debulking \\<3 months prior to study entry (Screening Visit).\n5. History of hepatic arterial embolisation, hepatic arterial chemoembolisation and/or selective internal radiation therapy (selective internal radiation \\[SIR\\] therapy \\[SIRT\\]; e.g. SIR Spheres) \\<6 months prior to study entry (Screening Visit).\n6. Short bowel syndrome.\n7. Uncontrolled diabetes and/or hypertension.\n8. Severe renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate \\<30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and/or severe liver impairment as evidenced by serum total bilirubin \\>1.5 mg/dL associated with bile duct blockage or with alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) \\>5.0 upper limit of normal (ULN).\n9. Diagnosis of cardiac disease New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification \\>Class I. (Subject has limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity causes undue fatigue, palpitation, or dyspnoea).\n10. Life expectancy less than 1 year.\n11. Any malignancies except carcinoid tumour, basocellular carcinoma of the skin, in situ carcinoma of the cervix and ≥5 years disease free after curative cancer treatment.\n12. Any serious medical condition that could jeopardise the safety of the subject and/or the efficacy assessments of the study.\n13. Subject is being treated with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and has been at a stable dose (no change in dose or frequency of administration) for less than 4 weeks at study entry (Screening Visit).",

NET are highly vascular tumors, and high VEGF expression has been correlated with worse clinical and pathological characteristics as well as poor prognosis. A novel antiangiogenic approach relies on targeting not only the endothelial cells but also rendering them more sensitive to VEGFR blockade by achieving pericyte detachment. In this study, the dose of sorafenib will be titrated up to a maximum of 800mg BID based on patients' toxicity and on a novel pharmacodynamic assay that measures inhibition of molecular target(PDGFR) in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Dual VEGFR targeting is achieved by administering sorafenib plus metronomic low dose cyclophosphamide.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well temsirolimus and bevacizumab work in treating patients with advanced endometrial, ovarian, liver, carcinoid, or islet cell cancer. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temsirolimus together with bevacizumab may kill more tumor cells.",

      "detailed_description": "STZ plus 5-Fuorouracil (5FU) is the actual standard of care for advanced pancreatic Neuroendocrine tumours (pNETS) in the European Union. Everolimus has been recently approved for its use in advanced pNETs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in Europe by the European Medical Agency (EMA).\n\nA randomized study is needed to have a clear knowledge about the best sequence for its administration; this is, before or after palliative chemotherapy.\n\nThere may or may not be any benefits from giving first each other treatment of the study. The information obtained from this study will help the physician improve the treatment and management of patients with advanced pNET.\n\nThis study was planned to compare STZ-5FU chemotherapy followed by everolimus upon progression versus the reverse sequence. However sequential studies with pNETs are hard to be managed in terms of time and costs. Therefore the protocol was amended to have PFS1 (progression free survival after course 1) as primary endpoint and PFS2 (i.e. progression free survival after both STZ based chemotherapy and Everolimus or the reverse order) as secondary endpoint. This information will be extremely valuable for the day to day clinical practice of pNETs oncologists",

Treatment naive patients can be also included if the patient needs active treatment with either chemotherapy or everolimus.\n* Presence of measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria 1.0, documented by a Triphasic Computed Tomography (CT) scan or multiphase MRI radiological assessment.\n* Previous treatment with somatostatin (SS) analogues is allowed. Only those patients with active functioning syndrome at entry can continue with SS analogues during the study.\n* Adequate bone marrow and renal functions, and serum fasting cholesterol\n* Women with child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test.\n* Written Informed Consent obtained according to local regulations\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Previous treatment with chemotherapy and/or mTOR inhibitors or tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n* Immune therapy or radiation therapy within 4 weeks prior to the patient entering the study.\n* Hepatic artery embolization within the last 6 months (1 month if there are other sites of measurable disease), or cryoablation/radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastasis within 2 months of enrolment.\n* Previous treatment with Peptide-Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) within the last 6 months and/or without progression following PRRT.\n* Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.\n* Any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions.\n* Treatment with potent inhibitors or inducers of Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A) isoenzyme within 5 days immediately before the start of treatment.\n* Patients on chronic treatment with corticosteroids or any other immunosuppressive agent.\n* Patients known to be HIV seropositive.\n* Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to everolimus or its excipients or other rapamycin analogues. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.\n* Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to 5FU or STZ or its excipients (notice that this criterion includes patients with known deficit of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency -DPD).\n* Pregnant, lactating women or fertile adults not using effective birth control methods.\n* For administrative matters (insurance) patients ≥ 95 are not allowed during the trial.\n\nOnly those patients coming from the hospital pool will be included in SEQTOR trial (e.g. persons detained in an institution as a result of an official or court order are excluded).",

Eligible participants will undergo baseline assessments at enrollment. They will receive 68Ga-DOTATOC and undergo a PET/CT imaging study. Participants may receive a second 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT for restaging after therapy 12-36 months following the first scan.",

Subject is male; or is a female who is either surgically sterile (has had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy), postmenopausal (\\> 1 years without menses), ≥60 years old,or of childbearing potential for whom a pregnancy test (with the results known prior to investigational product administration) is negative. A negative pregnancy test will be required for all female subjects with child bearing potential. If a false pregnancy test is suspected, e.g., perimenopausal condition, an obstetrician will be consulted to determine if she is/is not capable of becoming pregnant. Female must also be non-lactating.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Subject weighs more than 450 pounds. (Subjects who weigh more than 450 pounds will not be able to fit inside the imaging machines) or otherwise cannot be safely fit into the imaging system.\n2. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (due to cough, severe arthritis, etc.)\n3. Inability to complete the needed investigational and standard-of-care imaging examinations due to other reasons (severe claustrophobia, radiation phobia, etc.)\n4. Any additional medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or other extenuating circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance.\n5. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) within 4 weeks of Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT scan.\n6. Treatment with Sandostatin LAR within 4 weeks, SQ Octreotide within 12 hours, or Lanreotide injection within 8 weeks of Ga-68 DOTATOC PET/CT (+/-5%).",

      "detailed_description": "RAD001 is a new drug that is designed to block a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells. Octreotide Depot is FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome and hormonal symptoms from certain islet cell carcinomas. Octreotide Depot may also help to block certain proteins that are important in tumor growth.\n\nBefore you can start treatment on the study, you will have what are called \"screening tests\". These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. You will be asked questions about your medical history and about any medications you are currently taking or have taken in the past. You will have a complete physical exam and your heart rate, temperature, breathing rate, blood pressure, height, and weight will be measured. You will be asked about your ability to perform every day activities. Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected for routine tests. You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart) and scans (either Computed Tomography/CT or Magnetic Resonance Imaging/MRI) to evaluate the cancer. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.\n\nIf the screening evaluations show you are eligible to take part in the study, you may begin treatment. You will take RAD001 by mouth once a day, every day while on study. You should take it in a fasting state or after no more than a light, fat-free meal. You should take RAD001 about the same time each day. Octreotide Depot will be given as an injection into the muscle of either buttock once every 4 weeks while on study. This will be done at M. D. Anderson. Four weeks (28 days) is called one course of treatment.\n\nClinic visits will occur every 2 weeks during the first 4 weeks and every 4 weeks from then on. At each clinic visit, you will be asked questions about your medical history and about any medications you are currently taking or have taken in the past. You will have a complete physical exam and your heart rate, temperature, breathing rate, blood pressure, height, and weight will be measured. You will be asked about your ability to perform every day activities. Blood samples (about 1 teaspoons) for routine tests will be collected every 2 weeks for the first 8 weeks. After that, blood samples (about 2 teaspoons) will be collected every 4 weeks. CT or MRI scan(s) will be performed every 12 weeks.\n\nIf a sample of your tumor tissue that was removed previously is available, it will be analyzed for expression of proteins that may effect tumor growth. However, if a sample is not available, you will not be asked to undergo a biopsy to collect this tissue. This sample may analyzed at any time during the study.\n\nIf you experience severe side effects, treatment may be delayed, stopped, or you may receive smaller doses of RAD001 and/or Octreotide Depot. You may continue to receive up to at least 12 courses of study treatment unless the disease gets worse, you decide not to take part any longer, or your doctor decides it is in your best interest to stop treatment. It may be possible to continue treatment beyond 12 courses if you are benefitting from this treatment.\n\nWhen you stop study treatment, you will be asked to have some tests and evaluations done. About 4 teaspoons of blood will be taken for routine lab tests, You will also have a physical exam and CT scan or MRI scan will be done to check the size and location of your disease.\n\nThis is an investigational study. RAD001 is investigational and is not commercially available. The drug combination in this study is also investigational. RAD001 is manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. About 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.",

The hypothesis is that HG-NEC (excluding small cell carcinoma) can be segregated based on mutational analysis and that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assignment of therapy is feasible and will potentially improve the outcomes.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nThere is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.\n\nLCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015 World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.\n\nLCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.\n\nBased on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).\n\nSimilarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.\n\nTreatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent, driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently defined a new subtype of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in large-cell carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example.\n\nTo date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapies for metastatic HG-NECs, based on mutational profiles. This study will utilize recent genomic profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of optimal treatments.",

However, clinical behavior is heterogeneous and when tumor progression is observed, treatment options are limited. The most used therapy for neuroendocrine tumors management are somatostatin analogs. However, even the use in lung carcinoids is quite usual, no antitumoral activity has been demonstrated. Tremelimumab and Durvalumab combination could be more efficient drugs to improve immune system activation and could obtain a significantly higher clinical benefit in these patients. Tremelimumab and Durvalumab would be the first immune combination agents showing efficacy in neuroendocrine neoplasms of different origins.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial is studying how well CCI-779 works in treating patients with progressive metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CCI-779, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.",
      "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the objective tumor response rate (i.e. partial or complete responses as defined by the RECIST criteria) in patients with progressive metastatic neuroendocrine tumours given CCI-779.\n\nII. To assess the stable disease rate and duration, time to progression, median survival time, 1-year survival rate and toxicity in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine carcinomas given CCI-779. As of 19 July 2010, overall survival follow-up is to be discontinued for the four remaining patients on long term follow-up. At that point in time, these patients had been off-treatment for 3 to 5 years. Time to progression and median survival times will be based on the currently available data.\n\nIII. To measure baseline levels of various elements up- and downstream of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Where post-treatment biopsies are available, they will be analyzed for suppression of elements in the mTOR pathway as well as for any effect on cell cycle progression, apoptosis or anti-angiogenic effects.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.\n\nPatients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR or PR.\n\nPatients are followed up for survival.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed neuroendocrine tumours either of carcinoid histology or a carcinoma of pancreatic islet cell origin; small cell variant, endocrine organ carcinomas, and adrenal gland malignancies (including paragangliomas) are excluded from this study\n* Patients must have progressive metastatic disease defined by one of the following occurring within 6 months of study entry:\n\n  * At least a 25% increase in radiologically or clinically measurable disease\n  * Appearance of any new lesion or\n  * Deterioration in clinical status\n* Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as \\>= 20 mm with conventional techniques or as \\>= 10 mm with spiral CT scan\n* Previous local therapy (e.g. chemoembolization or bland embolization) allowed if completed \\> 6 weeks prior to study entry; for patients who received local therapy prior to study entry, there must be either progression of measurable disease documented within the treatment field, or must have measurable disease outside the treatment field prior to study entry\n* Previous chemotherapy, investigational agents or radioactive therapies (e.g. radioactive octreotide) allowed if completed \\> 4 weeks prior to study entry (\\> 6 weeks if last regimen contained BCNU or mitomycin C); for patients who received systemic therapy prior to study entry, there must be documented progression of measurable disease prior to study entry\n* Patients must not have disease that is currently amenable to surgery; prior surgery is allowed no less than 6 weeks prior to study entry\n* Previous radiation therapy is allowed if \\> 4 weeks have elapsed since delivery of a dose likely to have myelotoxic effects (e.g. ≥ 3000cGy to fields including substantial marrow)\n* Life expectancy of greater than 3 months\n* ECOG performance status ≤ 2 (Karnofsky ≥ 60%)\n* Leukocytes ≥ 3.0 x 10\\^9/L\n* Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10\\^9/L\n* Platelets \\>= 100 x 10\\^9/L\n* Total bilirubin ≤ 1.25 x ULN\n* AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN; \\< 5 x ULN with liver metastases\n* Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN OR creatinine clearance (CrCl) calculated ≥ 60mL/min/1.73m\\^2\n* Fasting serum cholesterol =\\< 350 mg/dL (9.0 mmol/L)\n* Triglycerides =\\< 400 mg/dL (4.56 mmol/L)\n* Must be willing and able to undergo tumor biopsy once before and once during experimental therapy; patients must have tumor lesions accessible for biopsy for correlative studies; in cases where there is a medical contraindication to tumor biopsy, exception may be granted upon discussion with the Principal Investigator/Chair\n* The effects of CCI-779 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown; for this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier\n* Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents concurrently or within 4 weeks of study entry\n* Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to CCI-779\n* Concurrent cancer from another primary site requiring treatment of any kind within the past 3 years; curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the cervix are allowed\n* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because CCI-779 is an inhibitor of mRNA translation with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with CCI-779, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with CCI-779\n* HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with CCI-779; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated",

      "intervention": "AMG 479",
      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of AMG 479 against carcinoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. AMG 479 is an antibody that is made in the laboratory. Antibodies are highly specific proteins produced by the body's immune system that recognize foreign substances in the body. AMG 479 has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that AMG 479 may help to prevent the growth of some neuroendocrine tumors. The observed antitumor activity of AMG 479, together with the current limited treatment options available for patients with neuroendocrine tumors, warrant further investigation of AMG 479 in this patient population.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of neoplasms. NETs are commonly subclassified into two broad subgroups according to their site of origin: pancreatic NETs are thought to arise from the endocrine cells of the pancreas, whereas NETs of other sites such as the lungs or gastrointestinal tract are often referred to as carcinoid tumors. While histologically similar, carcinoid tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have demonstrated different response rates in prior phase II studies of antitumor agents. Because of these differences, we will perform the current study using two cohorts of patients (30 with carcinoid and 30 with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors). The statistical design, however, is the same for both cohorts. With 30 patients in each cohort, this study has 80% power assuming type I error of 6% to differentiate a \\>/=17% objective response rate from a \\</=5% objective response rate using a single stage design. The proposed regimen would be promising in either cohort if at least 4 of 30 patients achieve an objective response.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Locally unresectable or metastatic carcinoid or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. To be classified as having a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, patients must have clinical evidence of currently having or having had a primary pancreatic neuroendocrine lesion.\n* Measurable disease by RECIST criteria\n* Evidence of progressive disease (by RECIST) within 12 months of study entry.\n* Tumors must be considered well- or moderately-differentiated. Patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of small cell carcinoma are excluded from this study.\n* Adequate hepatic, renal, bone marrow and glycemic function as outlined in the protocol\n* Prior treatment with chemotherapy, hepatic artery embolization, surgery or other therapeutic agents is allowed.\n* Prior or concurrent therapy with somatostatin analogs is permitted: however patients must continue on a stable dose of somatostatin analogs while receiving study treatment.\n* 18 years of age or older\n* ECOG performance status 0, 1, or 2 \\[Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group \\]\n* Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks\n* Negative pregnancy test\n* Ability to sign informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Poorly differentiated or small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas\n* Insulin secreting pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (insulinomas)\n* Clinically apparent central nervous system metastases or carcinomatous meningitis.\n* Myocardial infraction in the past 6 months\n* Major surgery 4 weeks prior to enrollment\n* Uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric illness\n* Pregnant or lactating women. Both men and women of childbearing potential must be advised of the importance of using effective birth control measures during the course of the study.\n* Prior antitumor therapy within 4 weeks of enrollment (with the exception of somatostatin analogs).\n* Recent infection requiring systemic anti-infective treatment that was completed 14 days or less prior to enrollment (with the exception of uncomplicated urinary tract infection or upper respiratory tract infection).\n* Known positive test for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C, chronic or active hepatitis B\n* Prior IGF or IGF receptor inhibitor therapy \\[insulin like growth factor \\]",

Ki67 index ≤ 20% (to be centrally confirmed).\n3. Patients on Octreotide LAR at a fixed dose of 20 mg or 30 mg at 3-4 weeks intervals for at least 12 weeks prior to randomization in the study.\n4. Patients ≥18 years of age.\n5. Patients must have progressive disease based on RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1 while receiving an uninterrupted fixed dose of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks). Disease progression must be centrally confirmed. In order to make the assessment, two CT (or MRI) scans are required. The oldest scan must not be older than 3 years from the date of randomization. The most recent scan must not be older than 4 weeks from the date of randomization. Both scans must be obtained while the patient is receiving the same fixed dose of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks) with the following exceptions; 1) it is acceptable if the oldest scan is obtained within 12 weeks of the patient receiving a fixed dose regimen of Octreotide LAR (20-30 mg/3-4 weeks); AND 2) it is acceptable for either scan to be obtained before or during the time a patient receiving a fixed dose of Octreotide LAR has switched to an equivalent dose of short acting Octreotide for up to 6 weeks in order to obtain an OctreoScan®, provided the patient returns to the Octreotide LAR fixed dose after the OctreoScan® has been obtained.\n6. Confirmed presence of somatostatin receptors on all target lesions (for target/non-target/measurable lesions definition see §Appendix 2, Section 1 and 2, RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1) documented by CT/MRI scans, based on positive OctreoScan® imaging within 24 weeks prior to randomization in the study (to be centrally confirmed). The OctreoScan® should be one that was performed while the patient was on a fixed dose of Octreotide LAR. If a patient has had an OctreoScan® performed while Octreotide LAR treatment-naïve, the patient must have a repeat OctreoScan® performed after 3 months of Octreotide LAR treatments before entering the clinical study to prove that the index lesions or new lesions still meet the criteria for inclusion. It is acceptable to have patients temporarily switched to Octreotide s.c. (up to six weeks) in order to obtain an OctreoScan®, provided they return to the same fixed dose of Octreotide LAR prior to the scan.\n7. The tumour uptake observed in each target lesion (for target/non-target/measurable lesions definition see §Appendix 2, Sections 1 and 2, RECIST Criteria, Version 1.1) using OctreoScan® must be ≥ normal liver uptake observed on planar imaging (to be centrally confirmed) (§Appendices 5 and 6).\n8. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS)\\>=60.\n9. Presence of at least 1 measurable site of disease.\n10. \\[Applicable only for France\\] All patients included in the trial must be affiliated with a social security regime or be a beneficiary of the same in order to be included in the study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Either serum creatinine \\>150 µmol/L (\\>1.7 mg/dL), or creatinine clearance \\<50 mL/min calculated by the Cockroft Gault method, eventually confirmed by measured creatinine clearance (or measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using plasma clearance methods, not gamma camera-based) \\<50 mL/min (the measured creatinine clearance / GFR is required only as confirmatory exam).\n2. Hb concentration \\<5.0 mmol/L (\\<8.0 g/dL); WBC \\<2x109/L (2000/mm3); platelets \\<75x109/L (75x103/mm3).\n3. Total bilirubin \\>3 x ULN.\n4. Serum albumin \\<3.0 g/dL unless prothrombin time is within the normal range.\n5. Pregnancy or lactation.\n6. For female patients of childbearing potential (defined as \\< 2 years after last menstruation and not surgically sterile) and male patients, who are not surgically sterile or with female partners of childbearing potential: absence of effective, non-hormonal means of contraception (intrauterine contraceptive device, barrier method of contraception in conjunction with spermicidal gel) as defined in §Appendix 7.\n7. Treatment with \\>30 mg Octreotide LAR at 3-4 weeks intervals within 12 weeks prior to randomization in the study.\n8. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) at any time prior to randomization in the study.\n9. Any surgery, radioembolization, chemoembolization, chemotherapy and radiofrequency ablation within 12 weeks prior to randomization in the study.\n10. Interferons, Everolimus (mTOR-inhibitors) or other systemic therapies within 4 weeks prior to randomization in the study.\n11. Known brain metastases, unless these metastases have been treated and stabilized for at least 24 weeks, prior to enrollment in the study. Patients with a history of brain metastases must have a head CT with contrast to document stable disease prior to randomization in the study.\n12. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure (NYHA II, III, IV).\n13. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as defined by a fasting blood glucose \\>2 ULN.\n14. Any patient receiving treatment with short-acting Octreotide, which cannot be interrupted for 24 h before and 24 h after the administration of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate, or any patient receiving treatment with Octreotide LAR, which cannot be interrupted for at least 6 weeks before the administration of 177Lu-DOTA0-Tyr3-Octreotate, unless the tumour uptake on target lesions observed by OctreoScan® imaging during continued Octreotide LAR treatment is at least as high as normal liver uptake observed by planar imaging.\n15. Patients with any other significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition, currently uncontrolled by treatment, which may interfere with the completion of the study.\n16. Prior external beam radiation therapy to more than 25% of the bone marrow.\n17. Current spontaneous urinary incontinence.\n18. Other known co-existing malignancies except non-melanoma skin cancer and carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, unless definitively treated and proven no evidence of recurrence for 5 years.\n19. Patients who have not provided a signed informed consent form to participate in the study, obtained prior to the start of any protocol related activities.\n20. Patient with known incompatibility to CT Scans with I.V. contrast due to allergic reaction or renal insufficiency. If such a patient can be imaged with MRI, then the patient would not be excluded.\n21. Patients who have participated in any therapeutic clinical study/received any investigational agent within the last 30 days are excluded from participation in this trial.",

      "brief_summary": "This research study is evaluating the drug Ramucirumab as a possible treatment for Advanced, Progressive Carcinoid Tumors.",
      "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of ramucirumab in advanced, progressive carcinoid tumors.\n\nCancer cells can make growth factors that cause the abnormal growth of new blood vessels. Ramucirumab is an investigational drug which works by blocking a receptor for a vascular growth factor, thereby preventing new blood vessels from forming. This may stop the cancer from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ramucirumab for treatment of Carcinoid Tumors.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed low- to intermediate-grade neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid tumor).\n* Carcinoid tumors of any site are eligible. Patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are excluded.\n* Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See Section 10 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n* Locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic disease.\n* Patients must have evidence of radiographic disease progression within the past 12 months. Progressive disease by RECIST criteria is not required.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status 0-1 (see Appendix A).\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/ mm3\n  * platelets ≥100,000/ mm3\n  * hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL\n  * total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit of normal, or ≤ 5× institutional upper limit of normal in the setting of liver metastases\n  * creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal\n  * urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (if urine dipstick or routine urinalysis is 2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate \\<1000 mg of protein in 24 hours)\n  * coagulation function Adequate coagulation function as defined by International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal. Patients on full-dose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose (minimum duration 14 days) of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin.\n  * The effects of ramucirumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because anti-antiangiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of Ramucirumab administration.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n* Patients who have undergone major surgery within 28 days or subcutaneous venous access device placement within 7 days prior to study enrollment.\n* Patients with elective or planned major surgery to be performed during the course of the clinical trial.\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients with any Grade 3-4 gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months prior to enrollment.\n* Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or any other significant thromboembolism (venous port or catheter thrombosis or superficial venous thrombosis are not considered \"significant\") during the 3 months prior to registration.\n* Patients who have experienced any arterial thromboembolic events, including but not limited to myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, or unstable angina, within 6 months prior to enrollment.\n* Patients with uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (\\>160 mmHg systolic or \\> 100 mmHg diastolic for \\>4 weeks) despite standard medical management.\n* Patients who have congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, clinically significant bradycardia, advanced heart block within the six months preceding enrollment.\n* Patients who have cirrhosis at a level of Child-Pugh B (or worse) or cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis.\n* Patients with a serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Patients receiving chronic antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and others), dipyridamole or clopidogrel, or similar agents. Once-daily aspirin use (maximum dose 325 mg/day) is permitted.\n* Patients with uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases.\n* Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or other adequately treated in situ cancer, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years.\n* Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis.\n* Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:\n\n  * Severely impaired lung function\n  * Any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infection/ disorders.\n  * Nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the treatment with the study therapy\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ramucirumab .\n* Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because ramucirumab is associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ramucirumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ramucirumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.",

      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "phase": "PHASE2",
      "condition": "Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor G1; Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor G2; Refractory Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Carcinoma",
      "intervention": "Sapanisertib",
      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well sapanisertib works in treating patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic), does not respond to treatment (refractory), or cannot be surgically removed. Drugs such as sapanisertib may stop the growth or shrink tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate overall response rate associated with sapanisertib (MLN0128 \\[TAK-228\\]) in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).\n\nSECONDARY ENDPOINTS:\n\nI. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) associated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).\n\nII. To measure the safety and tolerability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with advanced PNETs.\n\nIII. To evaluate disease control rate associated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with advanced PNETs.\n\nIV. To measure duration of response rate associated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with advanced PNETs.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly for 2 years.",

The study will enroll at least 8 patients in the GEP-NET cohort and as many adolescents with PPGL as possible in the exploratory PPGL cohort.",
      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consists of the screening period (up to 2 weeks) followed by the treatment period (4 treatment administrations at 8-week interval), and the follow-up period (10 years).\n\nThe treatment period will consist of 4 Lutathera treatments administered at 8-week intervals. Lutathera administration will occur on Week 1 Day 1 of each cycle. Each patient will receive a total of 4 doses of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi). An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with each Lutathera dose for renal protection according to the approved Lutathera local prescribing information. An antiemetic will be administered prior to infusion of the AA solution for prevention of infusion-related nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe dosimetry and PK assessments will be performed during the first week after the 1st Lutathera dose, i.e. one time during the study treatment period for each patient. The dosimetry analysis will allow for estimation from the 1st Lutathera administration of the cumulative absorbed radiation dose from 4 Lutathera doses and also for taking a decision on the next dose levels. In the exceptional circumstances when dosimetry cannot be performed in a particular patient after the first Lutathera dose, it should be completed as soon as feasible upon a later dose. In order to minimize risk for each study subject, an accelerated analysis of dosimetry and safety data will be performed for each patient in the study, to enable the Investigator to take a decision for the subsequent Lutathera doses. The results of dosimetry assessments (imaging and blood dosimetry) will be provided to the investigators for their evaluation prior to administration of subsequent therapeutic cycles in each patient.\n\nA total follow-up period of 10 years (120 months) after the last Lutathera dose will take place for each patient who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This follow-up period will be comprised of a short-term follow-up of 6 months to evaluate cumulative Lutathera toxicities, followed by a long-term follow up of another 114 months.\n\nAn external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also operate in the study to evaluate accumulating safety and dosimetry data, to ensure the safety of adolescents enrolled in the study, and to provide recommendations to investigators as well as to the clinical team in charge of conducting the study.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies ziv-aflibercept in treating and perfusion computed tomography perfusion imaging in predicting response in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Ziv-aflibercept may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Diagnostic procedures, such as computed tomography perfusion, imaging may help measure a patient's response to ziv-aflibercept treatment.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate the objective response rate (RR) of ziv-aflibercept among patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET)s according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n\nII. Test the following hypotheses: that baseline perfusion computed tomography (CT) parameters can predict which patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) will respond to treatment with ziv-aflibercept.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate progression free survival (PFS) duration among patients treated with ziv-aflibercept.\n\nII. Evaluate the relationship between response rate and baseline blood volume (BV) and between response rate and baseline permeability surface (PS).\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BV expressed as relative change from baseline correlate with response to ziv-aflibercept.\n\nII. Determine whether post-treatment tumor blood flow (BF) (absolute measurement) correlates with response to ziv-aflibercept.\n\nIII. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BF and, BV, expressed as relative change from baseline, correlate with relative change in sum of tumor diameters (RECIST 1.1 measurements).\n\nIV. Determine the effect of ziv-aflibercept therapy on post-treatment blood flow (BF), BV, mean transit time (MTT), and PS at 4 weeks after treatment.\n\nV. Evaluate the changes in tumor perfusion parameters at time of progression.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography perfusion imaging at baseline, day 21 of course 1, and at time of progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.",

      "detailed_description": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\n* Determine the 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumors treated with AMG 706 and octreotide acetate.\n\nSecondary\n\n* Determine the response rate and overall survival of patients treated with these drugs.\n* Determine the toxicity and tolerability of AMG 706 in these patients.\n* Determine the effect of AMG 706 on tumor perfusion by functional computerized tomography (CT) scan.\n* Determine the effect of AMG 706 on tumor markers (e.g., chromogranin A, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and gastrin) specific for neuroendocrine tumors.\n* Determine the effect of AMG 706 on serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels.\n* Determine the expression of VEGF, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), chromogranin A, human achaete-scute homolog-1 (hASH1), and Notch1 markers of neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\nPatients receive oral AMG 706 and octreotide acetate intramuscularly once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nPlasma samples are collected at baseline, periodically during study treatment, and at 4 weeks after the completion of study treatment. Samples are used to determine plasma VEGF levels. Gene expression of downstream markers of Raf kinase expression (raf, MEK, and ERK) as well as hASH1 and Notch1 are evaluated at baseline. Tumor tissue collected at diagnosis or prior surgery is examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. Contrast CT scans are conducted at baseline, day 2 of course 1, and week 8 to assess tumor perfusion.\n\nAfter the completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients will be accrued for this study.",

      "detailed_description": "The Study Drugs:\n\nAvastin is designed to prevent the formation of new blood vessels that help cancer cells to grow. RAD001 is designed to block a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells.\n\nStudy Groups:\n\nIf you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two treatment groups. During Cycle 1, one group will receive Avastin and the other group will receive RAD001. Each study cycle is 3 weeks long. In Cycle 2 and every cycle after that, participants in both groups will receive both study drugs. There is an equal chance of being assigned to either group.\n\nRAD001 Administration:\n\nRAD001 tablets are taken once a day by mouth, followed by a large glass of water. The tablets are in a blister-pack under aluminum foil. The blisters should only be opened at the time you take the study drug.\n\nYou may either take RAD001 on an empty stomach or after a low-fat meal. Some examples of low-fat meals include: cereal with fat-free milk, muffin or bagel with fat-free spread, or fruit salad. You should avoid taking RAD001 after large fatty meals because this will lower the amount of RAD001 your body absorbs. Your dietary habits around the time you take RAD001 should be as consistent as possible throughout the study.\n\nYou should take RAD001 at about the same time each day. The study staff will give you a medication diary that you should bring to every study visit. You will be asked to use the diary by writing down the date and time you take RAD001, how many tablets you take, and any side effects you may experience.\n\nAvastin Administration:\n\nAvastin is given through a needle in a vein in the arm. The first dose will be given over about 90 minutes. If no intolerable side effects occur, the second dose will be given over about 60 minutes, and if again no intolerable side effects occur, each dose after that will be given over about 30 minutes.\n\nOther Medications:\n\nIf you experience side effects from an Avastin infusion (such as fever/chills), you may receive additional medicine(s) at that time and before each later Avastin dose, in order to decrease the risk of side effects.\n\nStudy Visits:\n\nOn Day 1 of Cycle 1, you will receive your assigned study drug.\n\nAt the beginning of Cycle 2 and every cycle after that, you will be asked about any side effects you are experiencing. You will have a complete physical exam performed, including measurement of your vital signs and weight. Blood (about 3 teaspoons) and urine will also be collected for routine tests.\n\nOn Day 8 of Cycles 1 and 2 only, about 2 teaspoons of blood will be drawn for routine tests. These blood draws may be done at a local lab closer to your home.\n\nEvery 9 weeks, to check the status of the disease, you will have either CT scans or MRI scans of the tumor(s). The scans will be the same type that you had performed during screening. You will also have additional blood drawn (about 1-2 tablespoons each time) to check any tumor markers that were found to be increased in your blood during the screening tests.\n\nIn order to learn about the flow of blood to the tumor, non-routine functional CT scans will be performed at the end of Cycles 1 and 3. When possible, these scans will be performed at the same times as the routine CT scans.\n\nLength of Study Treatment:\n\nYou may receive up to 12 cycles of study treatment, as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.\n\nThis is an investigational study. RAD001 is not commercially available or FDA approved for this type of cancer. Avastin is commercially available and FDA approved for the treatment of advanced cancer of the colon and rectum. At this time, this drug combination is being used for research only.\n\nUp to 36 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at The University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed low or intermediate grade neuroendocrine carcinoma. Patients with neuroendocrine tumors associated with MEN1 syndrome will be eligible.\n2. Patients must have at least one measurable site of disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) that has not been previously irradiated. If the patient has had previous radiation to the target lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression in the lesion(s) since the radiation.\n3. Patients must have at least one lesion suitable for perfusion CT. The lesion should be greater than or equal to 3 cm in size in the cranial caudal direction.\n4. Patients who are on a somatostatin analogue must be on a stable dose (no change in mg dose of long acting octreotide or lanreotide, changes in dosing interval of +/- 1 week is allowed) for 2 months prior to date of randomization.\n5. Prior radiation therapy is permitted. A recovery period of at least 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy is required prior to date of randomization.\n6. Patients may have received prior interferon or cytotoxic chemotherapy. There are no limitations on the number of prior regimens. Patients who had no prior therapy are eligible. At least 28 days must have elapsed since last treatment.\n7. Patients may have received prior therapy targeting c-kit, abl, Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR), or estimated glomerular filtration rate or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, cetuximab).\n8. Age \\>/= 18 years of age, because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of bevacizumab and everolimus in patients \\< 18 years of age.\n9. Patients must have unresectable or metastatic disease.\n10. Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1.\n11. Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below: Leukocytes \\>/= 3,000/mcL; absolute neutrophil count \\>/=1,500/mcL; platelets \\>/=120,000 /mcL; total bilirubin \\</=1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN); aspartate aminotransferase (AST or SGOT) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) \\</=3.0 times institutional ULN (\\</= 5 \\* ULN in patients with liver metastases); creatinine \\</= 2.0 OR, creatinine clearance \\>/= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n12. Patients not on anticoagulation must have Prothrombin time (PT)/partial thromboplastin time (PTT) within 1.2 \\* the upper limit of normal.\n13. Patients on full-dose anticoagulation (warfarin or low molecular weight heparin) are eligible provided that both of the following criteria are met: The patient has an in-range INR (between 2 and 3) on a stable (no change in the prior 2 weeks) dose of oral anticoagulant or on a stable (no change in the prior 2 weeks) dose of low molecular weight heparin. The patient has no active bleeding or known pathological condition that carries a high risk of bleeding such as varices.\n14. Patients must have resting blood pressure (BP) no greater than 140 mmHg (systolic) or 90 mmHg (diastolic) for eligibility. Initiation or adjustment of BP medication is permitted prior to date of randomization.\n15. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to date of randomization. Women who have had menses within the past 2 years, who have not had a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy are considered to be of child-bearing potential.\n16.

      "brief_summary": "Background:\n\n- Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare but have been more common over the past decade. The only treatment for NETs is surgery, but most are found when they are too advanced for surgery. Researchers are looking for the best way to find NETs earlier, so that surgery can be successful. They want to test if the study drug can be used along with imaging devices to detect NETs.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To see how well a new experimental imaging agent, 68Gallium-DOTATATE, detects unknown primary and metastatic NETs in the gastrointestinal system and pancreas.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- Adults over 10 years old with a suspected NET or family history of NET.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam, and have a blood test.\n* Participants will undergo three scans. For all of these, a substance is injected into their body, they lie on a table, and a machine takes images.\n* A standard computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.\n* An octreotide scintigraphy Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT.\n* A 68Gallium-DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. The study drug is injected into a vein, usually in the arm. Low-dose X-rays go through the body. For about 40 minutes a large, donut-shaped device takes images of the body. The entire session takes 90 to 120 minutes.\n* Researchers will compare images from the three scans.\n* Participants will have 1 follow-up visit each year for 5 years. At this visit, they will have a medical exam, blood taken, and a CT scan.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare malignancies occurring in the gastrointestinal tract, islets of the pancreas, lung, adrenal medulla and thyroid C-cells.\n* Their incidence has increased over the last decade, with an incidence of 6 per 100,000 persons a year and they represent 0.46% of all malignancies.\n* Most NETs are sporadic, but they can be part of familial cancer syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), MEN2, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.\n* Surgical resection remains the only curative treatment option for patients with NETs but 80% of patients are diagnosed with advanced (metastatic, locally inoperable, or recurrent) disease.\n* The main prognostic factor in patients with NET is the extent of disease.\n* The best imaging technique for detecting unknown primary and metastatic NETs has yet to be determined.\n* NET cells express somatostatin receptors that can be targeted with radiolabeled 68Gallium-DOTATATE (Octreotate) for imaging purposes.\n* The primary goal of this protocol is to determine the accuracy of a new somatostatin receptor targeted imaging technique, using 68Gallium-DOTATATE PET/CT to detect unknown primary and metastatic NETs.\n\nObjectives:\n\n-To determine the accuracy of 68Gallium-DOTATATE PET/CT scans in detecting unknown primary and metastatic gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nEligibility:\n\n* Patients with:\n\n  * suspicion of NET on axial imaging (CT/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and/or\n  * biochemical evidence of NET (serum/urinary) based on elevated levels of chromogranin A, pancreatic polypeptide, neuron-specific enolase, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, serotonin (urinary 5-HIAA), gastrin, somatostatin, catecholamines, metanephrines, calcitonin, fasting insulin, C-peptide (proinsulin), glucagon and/or\n  * familial predisposition to NET in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and VHL.\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years of age.\n* Patients must be willing to return to National Institutes of Health (NIH) for follow-up.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Prospective study.\n* A 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scan will be done in patients with suspicious lesions, unknown primary tumor or metastatic gastrointestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine disease found on anatomic imaging (CT/MRI) or in patients having biochemically active disease.\n* Both functional and non-functional solid tumors will be included in this study. Furthermore, asymptomatic and symptomatic, sporadic and familial cases of NETs (such as Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), MEN1) will be included.\n* Demographic, clinical and pathologic data will be collected from the medical record and patient interview for each patient. Data will be stored in a computerized database.\n* After their initial on-study evaluation, patients will be staged according to findings on imaging studies with respect to primary tumor site, size and metastases. Surgical resection of NET and/or medical managements will be recommended based on standard practice guidelines. In patients who undergo surgical treatment, the samples will be immediately stored until molecular analysis.\n* Follow up will be done yearly for a total duration of 5 years. This includes a yearly imaging study and a biochemical and clinical evaluation, to assess tumor growth and disease progression.\n* We estimate that the accrual rate will be 3-10 patients per month; the total accrual period for this study will be 10 months to 3 years.",

Nintedanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by slowing or stopping a certain type of receptor called vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) from attaching to its target. This may stop the growth of neuroendocrine tumors by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess progression free survival (PFS), defined as the time interval from initiation of therapy, to its cessation for documentation of progressive disease (PD) or death.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the clinical response (complete response + partial response) in all patients with measurable disease (using standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] version \\[v\\]1.1 criteria).\n\nII. To assess overall survival (OS) in all patients. III. Assess changes in quality of life (QOL) throughout treatment using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) - Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) 21 (GI.NET21) questionnaire for carcinoid patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors, in all patients who have filled out at least two QOL questionnaires and, will be reported by groups based on response (response, stable disease or progressive disease).\n\nIV. Steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of nintedanib, biomarkers, regulatory T cell (Treg) and cytokine expression and growth factors will be analyzed for all patients and reported in groups based on response.\n\nV. Gene mutations and copy number alterations analysis in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (will be performed only on the first 10 patients), protein expression of activation of protein kinase B (Akt) (as well as other downstream targets).\n\nVI.

Investigators also want to learn if ONC201 can prevent new deposits of cancer from appearing in new places in participants (metastases). A phase 2 study of ONC201 in PC-PG (pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma) and other neuroendocrine tumors will determine whether inhibition of DRD2 (a member of the dopamine receptor family) is safe in unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, refractory, or metastatic neuroendocrine cancers including PC-PG, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), Ewing sarcoma (PNET) or any other neuroendicrine tumor with a catecholamine or dopamine biomarker or autocrine or paracrine dependence on dopamine including cholangiocarcinoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma.\n\nONC201 is an investigational (experimental) agent and has a favorable safety profile in phase 1 and early phase 2 clinical trials in advanced cancers. This study design has been chosen to see whether ONC201 is associated with reduction of anti-hypertension medications, safety and significant efficacy against neuroendocrine tumors, especially PC-PG.",

The same CT or MRI imaging to assess disease burden at study entry will be compared at week 6 and 3 months. Patients without progression at 3 months will continue treatment and have imaging at 6, 9 and 12 months after study entry. Metabolic response and/or biomarkers will be compared with study entry PET-CT and scans at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months.\n\nSecondary Objectives Progression - free Survival: This will be calculated according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) or development of new disease\n\nOverall survival: Overall survival will be determined by email or telephone contact.\n\nStudy Design: Phase 2 open-label fixed dose study Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors including PC-PG are rare diseases.\n\nThe current recommended phase II dose of 625 mg orally on 2 consecutive days every week will be used. The same imaging at study entry will be used at subsequent time points (CT or MRI for week 6 and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) Imaging modality choice will be influenced by the quality of prior scans of the subject and will be ordered so clinical comparison is possible.\n\nBecause of travel and lodging considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, some information by the study team/PI may be obtained using virtual visits and 2nd read of scans sent to Cleveland Clinic",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without cediranib works in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib and cediranib may help treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured by radiographic progression free survival (rPFS), as compared to olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib, as measured by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, radiographic response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1, and overall survival (OS), as compared to olaparib monotherapy in patients with mCRPC.\n\nII. To evaluate association of homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair deficiency (HRD) with the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib or olaparib monotherapy, as measured by rPFS, in mCRPC patients.\n\nIII. To evaluate the safety the combination of cediranib and olaparib and olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing in mCRPC patients and correlate that with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nII. To characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes, angiogenesis markers, and immune markers, by whole transcriptome sequencing and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIII. To characterize changes in immune tumor microenvironment in mCRPC patients by profiling expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIV. To identify baseline predictive biomarkers for rPFS or response and to identify on-treatment markers of acquired resistance in men with mCRPC receiving either olaparib plus cediranib or olaparib alone.\n\nV. To explore biomarker signatures that correlate with the clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib, including changes in gene expression or acquired mutations in tumor biopsies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.",

      "intervention": "Ziv-aflibercept",
      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and schedule.\n\nYou will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each cycle is 28 days.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle: questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).\n\nUrine tests will be performed every other cycle.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.\n\nAfter the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed: questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test, EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.",

RRx-001 is administered with autologous blood once weekly followed by or in combination with reintroduction of platinum-based doublet therapy.",
      "detailed_description": "This is an open label, four 'cohort' study for administration of RRx-001 with autologous blood once weekly followed by or in combination with reintroduction of platinum-based doublet therapy according to the treatment schedule listed below. Small cell carcinoma and ovarian cohort participants will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms, respectively. Neuroendocrine and NSCLC patients will be enrolled to single arms.\n\nParticipants with SCC will receive one of the following; RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy or platinum based chemotherapy alone. HGNEC, RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy. NSCLC, RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy. Participants with Platinum Refractory/Resistant Ovarian and MMMT will receive one of the following, RRx-001 followed by platinum doublet chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone.\n\nApproximately 213 participants will be enrolled.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n* Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced or metastatic:\n\n  * Resistant/Refractory Small Cell Carcinoma (SCC) patients in 3rd line or beyond that have previously received platinum or patients in 2nd line with platinum-refractory or platinum-resistant disease\n  * EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has previously received a first line platinum doublet and all applicable EGFR TKIs\n  * Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC), fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer and Malignant Mixed Mullerian Tumor (MMMT) of the ovary or uterus. Excludes other non-epithelial ovarian tumors and ovarian tumors with low malignant potential. Patients must have previously received a platinum based regimen for advanced/metastatic disease or have platinum resistant or refractory disease defined as relapse within 6 months. EOC - specific criteria: Patients who progress or have stable disease during first-line treatment or who relapse within 1 month are considered to be 'platinum-refractory'. Patients who respond to primary treatment and relapse within 6 months are considered 'platinum-resistant', and patients who relapse more than 6 months after completion of initial therapy are characterized as 'platinum-sensitive'. Patients who relapse 6-12 months following the end of their initial regimen are classified as 'partially sensitive'. Platinum sensitive patients may be enrolled but must have failed or declined all other lines of FDA approved therapy\n  * High-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (HGNEC), any organ of origin, including a pathology of neuroendocrine features, in patients previously been treated with chemotherapy Although neuroendocrine tumors may be classified differently based on organ of origin, in the context of this protocol they are defined as high grade on the basis of either\n\n    1. Aggressive clinical behavior requiring previous treatment with chemotherapy even if histologic features such as the Ki67 index or mitotic rate corresponds with low or intermediate grade.\n    2. Histologic features: (a) Neuroendocrine tumors of lung origin are considered high grade if in any part of the tumors, there are \\>10 mitoses/2mm2 or 10 high power field (HPF). Large zones of necrosis are usually present. This includes small cell lung carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma. \\[SCLC will not enroll in the HGNEC cohort.\\] (b)Neuroendocrine tumors of gastroenteropancreatic origin are considered high grade if in any part of the tumors there are either \\>20 mitoses/2mm2 or 10 high power field (HPF) OR Ki67.\n* Radiographically measurable disease by RECIST v1.1\n* A washout period of 3-weeks from last treatment.\n* Patients must have previously received a platinum based regimen for advanced/metastatic disease and progressed or have platinum resistant or refractory disease defined as relapse within 6 months.\n* Age ≥18 years.\n* Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.\n* ECOG performance status 0-2.\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below both prior to administration of RRx-001 and prior to administration of platinum doublet based regimen:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL\n  * Platelets ≥100,000/mcL (non-transfused platelet count)\n  * Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (transfused Hgb allowed)\n  * Creatinine ≤1.5 x the upper limit of normal\n  * Total bilirubin ≤2.0 x the upper limit of normal or \\<3.0 xULN if patient has a history of Gilbert's syndrome\n  * AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤5 X institutional upper limit of normal if with liver metastases; ≤2.5 X ULN if no liver metastases\n* Patient must consent to the access, review and analysis of previous medical and cancer history, including tumor archival tissue (if available) and imaging data by the sponsor or a third party nominated by the sponsor.\n* Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent document.\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.\n\n  * Note: A woman of child-bearing potential is any female (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or Has not been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Receiving concurrent investigational therapy\n* Symptomatic central nervous system metastasis (e.g., patients requiring increasing doses of steroids)\n* History of needing to permanently discontinue prior platinum doublet-based regimen for toxicity (e.g., cisplatin causing renal impairment, ototoxicity, or severe neuropathy).\n* Known severe hypersensitivity to the platinum agent (i.e., carboplatin or cisplatin) or prior partner of platinum agent (i.e., etoposide for SCC and HGNEC; nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or pemetrexed for NSCLC; paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, docetaxel or gemcitabine for ovarian) planned for the platinum therapy period. If the patient has had prior hypersensitivity reaction to the drug partner of platinum, a patient may enroll as long as it is acceptable to treat with platinum and one of the alternative chemotherapy partner agents.\n* Any significant medical diseases or conditions, as assessed by the investigators and sponsor that would substantially increase the medical risks of participating in this study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, NYHA II-IV congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study, severe chronic pulmonary disease or active uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled or clinically relevant pulmonary edema).\n* Pregnant or nursing",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well everolimus and octreotide acetate with or without bevacizumab works in treating patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that cannot be removed by surgery and have spread nearby or to other places in the body. Everolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Octreotide acetate may interfere with and slow the growth of tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Bevacizumab and everolimus also may stop the growth of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors by blocking blood flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether giving everolimus and octreotide acetate together is more effective with or without bevacizumab in treating pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.",

To assess the progression-free survival rate of patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with everolimus alone or everolimus plus bevacizumab.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare progression-free survival (PFS) among treatment arms shown to be efficacious.\n\nII. To estimate the overall tumor response rate in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with one of two novel regimens.\n\nIII. To estimate the overall biochemical response rate (as measured by plasma chromogranin A levels) in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with these regimens.\n\nIV. To assess the toxicity of each regimen in patients with metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nV. To assess the overall survival of patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors treated with these regimens.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive everolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and octreotide acetate intramuscularly (IM) on day 1.\n\nARM II: Patients receive everolimus and octreotide acetate as in Arm I. Patients also receive bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15.\n\nIn both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years.",

Prior liver-directed or ablative treatment must be completed at least 28 days prior to registration.\n  * Prior radiation therapy: Radiation therapy must be completed per the following timelines\n\n    * i) Radiotherapy to the thoracic cavity or abdomen within 4 weeks prior to registration.\n    * ii) Radiotherapy to bone lesions within 2 weeks prior to registration.\n    * iii) Radiotherapy to any other site within 4 weeks prior to registration.\n    * NOTE: In all cases, there must be complete recovery and no ongoing complications from prior radiotherapy.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL\n  * platelets ≥100,000/mcL\n  * total bilirubin ≤1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) (or 2.0 x ULN in patients with documented Gilbert's Syndrome)\n  * AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 × ULN or ≤ 3 × ULN for participants with documented liver metastases\n  * creatinine \\<1.5 × ULN Or creatinine clearance ≥40 mL/min (using Cockcroft-Gault formula) for participants with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n  * Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤ 1\n  * PT/INR or partial thromboplastin time (PTT) test \\< 1.3 the laboratory ULN within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment.\n* Negative urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.\n* Participant must be able to swallow pills.\n* The participant is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Major surgery (eg, GI surgery, removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 8 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Complete wound healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month before first dose and from minor surgery (eg, simple excision, tooth extraction) at least 10 days before first dose. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible.\n* Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Participants who have received a prior cabozantinib.\n* Participants who have received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti- PD-L2, anti-CD137, or anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including nivolumab, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation or checkpoint pathways)\n* Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.\n* The participant has tumor in contact with, invading, or encasing major blood vessels or radiographic evidence of significant cavitary pulmonary lesions.\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to cabozantinib or nivolumab.\n* Participants receiving any strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 within 14 days prior to registration are ineligible. Chronic treatment with strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 is not allowed.\n* Cardiovascular disorders including:\n\n  * Congestive heart failure (CHF): New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III (moderate) or Class IV (severe) at the time of screening;\n  * Concurrent uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) \\> 150 mm Hg systolic or \\> 100 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment;\n  * Any history of congenital long QT syndrome;\n  * QTcF interval \\>500 msec\n  * Any of the following within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment:\n\n    * unstable angina pectoris;\n    * clinically-significant cardiac arrhythmias;\n    * stroke (including transient ischemic attack (TIA), or other ischemic event);\n    * myocardial infarction;\n* GI disorders particularly those associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula formation including:\n\n  * Tumors invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer disease, active inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease), active diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis or acute obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric outlet obstruction\n  * Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months before screening\n* Thromboembolic events within 6 months of registration.\n\n  * Note: Low dose aspirin ≤ 81 mg/day is allowed. Anticoagulation with therapeutic doses of LMWH is allowed in patients who are on a stable dose of LMWH for at least 6 weeks prior to registration. Treatment with warfarin is not allowed.\n* The subject has experienced any significant bleeding episodes, including:\n\n  * Clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before the first dose of study treatment\n  * Clinically significant hemoptysis (\\> 0.5 teaspoon) within 3 months of the first dose of study treatment\n  * Any other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the start of study treatment\n  * Individuals with a history of different malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years or are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy.\n* Participant has an active infection requiring IV antibiotics\n* Any active, known, or suspected autoimmune disease. Participants with type I diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism only requiring hormone replacement, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger (e.g. celiac disease) are permitted to enroll.\n* Patient has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or on any other form of immunosuppressive medication. Adrenal replacement steroid disease are permitted in the absence of autoimmune disease.\n* The participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants with non-detectable viral loads on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cabozantinib and nivolumab.\n* The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluzone®) is allowed.\n* Pregnant or lactating females are excluded from this study because cabozantinib and nivolumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib and nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantinib and nivolumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n* Sexually active fertile subjects and their partners must agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier methods, including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and following treatment. Women of childbearing potential receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Contraception must be used for 4 months after last dose of cabozantinib.",

The purpose of the CRAD001K24133 study was to evaluate the safety profile of everolimus in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (pNETs) and to provide access of everolimus to this patient population. Everolimus was taken by participants until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, discontinuation from the trial for any other reason, or when it became commercially available for this indication, or until May 30, 2012, whichever came first. Prior to amendment 1, the study enrolled participants with NET of the lung (L-NETs) and gastrointestinal (GI) (GI-NETs) origin. The core study was stopped (per protocol) because everolimus was approved for pNETs. All ongoing patients with pNETs were switched to commercially available everolimus. For GI and lung NETs, everolimus was not approved at the time the core study was stopped. Therefore, patients with GI or lung NETs were not able to switch to commercial drug. To provide study medication access to these patients beyond 30 May 2012, the open label extension study, CRAD001K24133E1, was conducted. In the extension study, RAD001K24133E1, participants with GI or lung NETs who had not progressed during therapy with everolimus in the core study and who had not suffered from intolerable toxicity, were enrolled and treated with everolimus in order to provide data on long-term safety and efficacy. Patients were treated until it became commercially available in the respective indication or until documented tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity, any other reason or until study end on 31 May 2017, whichever came first.",

      "brief_summary": "It is well known that the prevalence of malnutrition or risk of malnutrition in cancer patients is high, as well as its impact on different parameters such as hospitalization, survival or response to certain treatments. In patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), due to their heterogeneity and longer survival, it is expected that the prevalence of malnutrition is probably underdiagnosed, as well as the existence of a negative impact on different parameters (quality of life, survival). So far, the studies carried out on nutrition and NET are very scarce and none has been carried out so far in Spain.\n\nBefore being able to carry out nutritional intervention studies on these patients, it is necessary to know the reality of the nutritional status of patients with NETs in Spain. The main motivation for the NUTRIGETNE study is to evaluate the epidemiological status of nutrition in NETs in the spanish population. In addition to know the epidemiological picture, it is intended to study the nutritional status from different points of view: analytical, clinical, anthropometric, etc. Besides, the study of nutritional status will allow us to closely monitor the patients who have a higher risk of malnutrition and to propose early interventions for those, as well as the impact of their nutritional status on different parameters: survival, hospitalization, quality of life or responses to the treatments.\n\nNUTRIGETNE is a cross-sectional, open and multicenter study in which the nutritional status of patients with GEP NET in Spain will be evaluated.",
      "detailed_description": "NUTRIGETNE is a cross-sectional, open and multicenter study in which the nutritional status of patients with GEP NET in Spain will be evaluated. It is planned to include 400 GEP NET patients. Patients will be included consecutively when visiting the corresponding health centers for outpatient visits or hospitalization.\n\nThe study comprises 3 stages with a total duration of 10 to 40 days for the participation of each subject in the study:\n\nScreening visit, First day (day 0): The initial screening will take place on the first day the patient visits the hospital. The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to assess the eligibility of the patient. The implications of the study will be explained to the patient and the informed consent will be signed.\n\nVisit for assessment of nutritional status (days 0-10): taking a medical history, complete physical examination including anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and dynamometry, as well as laboratory analysis. The evaluation of the nutritional status will be carried out by a registered nutritionist, specialized nurse or specialist doctor (variable depending on the characteristics of the center).\n\nData collection (day 10-40): collection of analytical, anthropometric, BIA, dynamometry and clinical results and introduction into the electronic case report form (eCRF).\n\nAfter the end of recruitment and database lock, all data will be subsequently analyzed and presented when applicable through study reports and scientific communications.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients diagnosed with a gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor by histopathological study.\n* Legally capable patients ≥ 18 and ≤ 80 years of age.\n* Patients who have signed the informed consent for this study as specified in section 10.3.\n* Patients in active treatment: active treatment is considered to be those patients in an advanced stage and in any type of medical treatment (somatostatin analogues, molecular therapies, chemotherapy, radionuclides...), or locoregional therapies.\n\nNote: Decision was taken to treat the patient with an specific treatment prior and independently of patient inclusion in this non interventional study.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients \\<18 or \\> 80 years of age.\n* Female patients that are currently pregnant.\n* Patients with a gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor lacking an histopathological diagnosis.\n* Patients in palliative treatment or terminal stage.\n* Patients who have not signed the informed consent or any situation or condition that compromises the giving of patient voluntary informed consent.",

      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consisted of a screening period followed by an infusion day with an optional overnight in-clinic stay, and a follow up call 48h post infusion.\n\nScreening Phase:\n\nAt screening, patient eligibility was determined according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, with evaluation of patient's vital signs, ECG and laboratory parameters. The duration of screening could be as short as one day but could not exceed 7 days. Patients who showed potassium level \\> 6.0 mmol/L (\\> 5.5 mmol/L for Poland only) at screening could have their potassium level corrected and could be re-screened afterwards.\n\nTreatment Phase:\n\nEligible patients were admitted to the in-clinic unit and dosed with arginine/lysine solution for infusion of 1,000 mL, which was administered intravenously over a period of 4 hours. Before the infusion (at 0 h time point), a set of baseline tests were performed. During and after the infusion, patient condition was monitored for evaluation of any adverse events. Only patients with a potassium level of ≤ 6 mmol/L at screening (\\> 5.5 mmol/L for Poland only) were allowed to be dosed. Potassium testing on the infusion day was performed at 0h (before the infusion), and at 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, and 24h after the start of infusion. Vital signs and ECGs were taken as specified in the assessment schedule. All patients were monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia, e.g. dyspnoea, weakness, numbness, chest pain and cardiac manifestations (conduction abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias). Other common adverse reactions during arginine/lysine solution administration are nausea and vomiting. Before the start of arginine/lysine solution infusion, an intravenous bolus of an anti-emetic was given. The choice of anti-emetic drugs was at the discretion of the physician.\n\nFollow-up Phase:\n\nAll patients were called for a safety follow-up in 48 hours after dosing. Patients were not scheduled to receive repeat dosing with arginine/lysine solution as concomitant medication with Lutathera® within 7 days of the arginine/lysine solution infusion in the study.",

CTCs have also been shown to be valuable as predictive markers following treatment and there is increasing interest in using CTCs as 'liquid biopsies' that can help to inform treatment decisions. CTC analysis has the benefit of being relatively non- invasive and quick compared with a conventional CT scan and is therefore an attractive method of monitoring the tumour throughout the treatment period.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the clinical value that enumeration will have in predicting the clinical symptomatic response and progression free survival in patients receiving Somatuline Autogel for functioning midgut NETs over a one year period.",

To determine whether cabozantinib (cabozantinib S-malate) can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nIII. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).\n\nIV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors using CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE.\n\nV. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nVI. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nOTHER OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Results of the primary analysis will be examined for consistency, while taking into account the stratification factors and/or covariates of baseline quality of life (QOL) and fatigue.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare overall quality of life, disease-related symptoms, and other domains between the two treatment groups (cabozantinib versus \\[vs.\\] placebo) within each cohort of patients (pancreatic NET vs. carcinoid tumor). (Quality of Life Substudy Objective - A021602-HO1)\n\nPOPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To describe the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response relationships of cabozantinib in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors. (Population Pharmacokinetics Substudy Objective - A021602-PP1)\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and CT, MRI, and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study. Patients may crossover to receive cabozantinib S-malate at the time of disease progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks until disease progression or start of new anticancer therapy, and then every 6 months until 8 years after registration.",

      "detailed_description": "This is a Phase 2 peptide receptor radionuclide therapy trial of 90Y-DOTATOC in patients with somatostatin receptor positive tumors. The somatostatin receptor targeting of the therapeutic will be checked with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT imaging prior to therapy. Treatment consists of 3 cycles, 6-8 weeks apart. Cycle 1 dose is fixed with Cycles 2 and 3 doses to be determined by dosimetry-based calculation of renal doses from previous cycles not to exceed 23 Gy for the total renal dose.\n\nThe goals of this project are to\n\n1. Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of dosimetry-guided peptide receptor radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide in patients with neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.\n2. Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTATOC.\n3. Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) or 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT as an accurate technique for diagnosis, staging, treatment targeting, and monitoring response to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Disease not amenable to standard treatment (nonresectable or disease present after one or more surgeries and/or Sandostatin treatment) or subject has failed existing first line chemotherapy, biologic therapy, targeted agent therapy or radiation therapy.\n2. Participation in Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry.\n3. A pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) malignant neoplasm with at least one target lesion that is confirmed by conventional imaging and is determined to express somatostatin receptors by 68Ga-DOTATOC (TATE) PET within 6 months prior to treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC.\n4. The target lesion is one that either has never received external beam radiation or has been previously irradiated and has since demonstrated progression. Any local irradiation of the target lesion or any non-target lesions via external beam, conformal or stereotactic radiation treatments must have occurred more than 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Any full cranial-spinal radiation, whether or not a target lesion is included in the field, must have occurred more than 3 months prior to study drug administration.\n5. Life expectancy \\> 2 months at the time of study drug administration.\n6. Archival tissue from a previous biopsy will be required.\n7. Age ≥ 6 months-90 years at the time of study drug administration.\n8. Performance status as determined by Karnofsky ≥ 60 or Lansky Play Scale ≥ 60% at the time of study drug administration.\n9. Completion of Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire.\n10. Within 7-10 days of study drug administration, patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n    * absolute neutrophil count \\>1000/mm3\n    * Platelets \\>90,000/mm3\n    * total bilirubin \\<3X ULN for age\n    * AST(SGOT) \\& ALT(SGPT) \\<10X institutional upper limit of normal for age\n    * Urinalysis no greater than 1+ hematuria or proteinuria\n    * Renal function\\* Adults(age18 or \\>): Serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl; if serum creatinine is \\>1.2 mg/dL, nuclear GFR will be measured. GFR will need to be ≥ 80 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects ≤40 years old, ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects between 41-50; ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects between 51-60; ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects \\> 60 years old.\n\n    Children(age \\<18): nuclear GFR ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\n    \\* Renal function criteria based on our previous experience with 90Y-DOTATOC therapy and known changes in GFR with age13,21,33-35\n11. The effects of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 90Y-DOTATOC is a Class C agent with potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.\n2. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with 90Y-DOTATOC, breastfeeding should be discontinued until 6 weeks after the last administration of study drug.\n3. Surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n4. External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of \\<500 cGy to a single kidney or radiation to \\< 50% of a single kidney is acceptable).\n5. Prior PRRT with 90Y-DOTATOC (TATE) or 177Lu-DOTATOC (TATE) or 131I-MIBG therapy for this malignancy.\n6. Another investigational drug within 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n7. Concurrent, malignant disease for which patient is on active therapy.\n8. Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to complete this protocol.\n9. Any subject for whom, in the opinion of their physician, a 12-hour discontinuation of somatostatin analogue therapy represents a health risk. Also subjects who have received SandostatinLAR in the past 28 days or long-acting lanreotide within the past 8 weeks are excluded. Subjects may be maintained on short acting octreotide during the time from last injection of long-acting somatostatin analogue until 12 hrs prior to injection of study drug. Known antibodies to Octreotide, Lanreotide, or DOTATOC or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 90Y-DOTATOC.\n10. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) of study drug administration or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n11. Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n12. Subject weighs more than 450 pounds. (Subjects who weigh more than 450 pounds will not be able to fit inside the imaging machines.)\n13. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (due to cough, severe arthritis, etc.)",

To estimate the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (per version 1.1) objective response rate of LEE011 (ribociclib) among patients with advanced foregut neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the progression free survival duration of LEE011 among patients with advanced foregut NETs.\n\nII. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of LEE011 in patients with advanced foregut NETs.\n\nIII. To determine clinic benefit rate at 6 months (defined as complete response plus partial response plus stable disease) with LEE011 among patients with advanced foregut NETs.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine baseline molecular markers (mutations, deletions, and amplifications in multiple endocrine neoplasia \\[MEN\\]1, p27, p16 and cyclin D1 \\[CCND1\\]) in archival tumor that may predict clinical benefit at 6 months from LEE011.\n\nII.

Show that NETs will have increased AMT uptake on PET, as compared to surrounding non-tumor tissue at baseline.\n\nII. Use compartmental modeling (in tumors with the left ventricle of the heart in the field-of-view) to measure change in AMT retention.\n\nIII. Measure change in AMT retention as mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean).\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nParticipants undergo AMT-PET within 7 days prior to, and 9-14 days after start of telotristat etiprate treatment. Participants receive telotristat etiprate orally (PO) three times a day (TID) for 9-14 days.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 3 months.",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase III trial studies octreotide acetate and recombinant interferon alfa-2b to see how well it works compared to octreotide acetate and bevacizumab in treating patients with high-risk neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Octreotide acetate and recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving octreotide acetate together with recombinant interferon alfa-2b is more effective than giving octreotide acetate together with bevacizumab in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare central review-based progression-free survival in poor prognosis carcinoid patients treated with either depot octreotide (octreotide acetate) plus bevacizumab, or depot octreotide plus interferon (recombinant interferon alfa-2b).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare overall survival, time to treatment failure and traditionally reported progression-free survival in poor prognosis carcinoid patients treated with either depot octreotide plus bevacizumab, or depot octreotide plus interferon.\n\nII. To compare objective response (confirmed and unconfirmed complete response \\[CR\\] and partial response \\[PR\\]) in poor prognosis carcinoid patients treated with either depot octreotide plus bevacizumab, or depot octreotide plus interferon.\n\nIII. To compare the toxicity profile of patients treated with these two regimens.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the prognostic and predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in relation to progression-free survival and treatment effect.\n\nII. To compare response of 5HIAA, chromogranin A and neuronspecific enolase among patients with elevated levels at baseline between patients treated with octreotide plus interferon versus octreotide plus bevacizumab.\n\nIII. To assess and compare the prognostic and predictive value of the combination of In-111 pentetreotide somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy (SRS) and computed tomography (CT) vs. CT in relation to progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nIV. To assess and compare the prognostic and predictive value of the combination of SRS and CT vs. CT in relation to overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive octreotide acetate intramuscularly (IM) and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.\n\nARM II: Patients receive octreotide acetate IM on day 1 and recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19.\n\nTreatment in both arms repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-6 months for up to 3 years.",

To determine the objective response rate (ORR) (complete and partial response) of GW786034 (pazopanib hydrochloride) 800 mg administered orally once daily in patients with advanced low or intermediate grade carcinoid tumors (in carcinoid cohort).\n\nII. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) (complete response and partial response) of GW786034 800mg administered orally once daily in patients with advanced low or intermediate grade pancreatic islet cell carcinoma (in islet cell cohort).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the progression free survival (PFS) duration of GW786034 800mg administered orally once daily in patients with low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nII. To determine the safety and tolerability of GW786034 800mg administered orally once daily in patients with low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nIII. To explore the effect on tumor blood flow as determined by functional computed tomography (CT) of GW786034 800 mg orally once daily in patients with low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nIV. To assess the trough level of GW786034 800 mg orally once daily in patients with low grade neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 90 days for up to 18 months.",

      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. For patients with progressive carcinoid tumors, progression-free survival (PFS defined by central review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] 1.1) will be compared between patients randomized to treatment with pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) versus placebo.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Overall survival (OS) will be compared between treatment arms. II. Objective response rate, duration of response, and time to treatment failure will be compared between treatment arms.\n\nIII. Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by central radiology review and local radiology review will be compared overall and within treatment arms.\n\nIV. Safety and tolerability of treatment with pazopanib/placebo will be evaluated within each treatment arm.\n\nV. PFS and other indicators of efficacy will be estimated in patients who crossover to pazopanib from placebo.\n\nVI. To determine the turn-around time for timely adjudicated central review. VII. To characterize the nature of discordance between local and central radiology review in assessment of progression.\n\nVIII. To characterize the type and rate of progression in carcinoid (at study entry, on-study, and at progression).\n\nIX. To develop new methods for modeling carcinoid growth and detecting treatment effects, and to perform simulations that advance new clinical trial designs to apply to future trials of carcinoid therapeutics.\n\nX. To assess for differences in quality of life (QOL)-related domains between the two treatment groups (pazopanib versus placebo).\n\nXI. To determine if the more brief measures of QOL-related domains provide comparable information to that which is provided by the longer assessments (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer \\[EORTC\\], neuroendocrine tumors \\[NET\\]21).\n\nXII. To provide validation data for the EORTC NET21 module in terms of responsiveness over time and differences across arms.\n\nXIII. To determine whether components of the plasma angiome panel that have been shown to be predictive previously (interleukin-6 \\[IL-6\\] and vascular endothelial growth factor \\[VEGF\\]-D) are predictive of a therapeutic advantage for pazopanib treatment in baseline samples from the patients treated on A021202.\n\nXIV. To determine whether other components of the plasma angiome panel tested (not IL-6 and VEGF-D) are predictive of a therapeutic advantage for pazopanib treatment in baseline samples from the patients treated on A021202.\n\nXV. To evaluate the changes in the plasma angiome markers after treatment with or without pazopanib over time.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. PFS at 6 months will be estimated within each treatment arm. II. Biochemical response (for chromogranin A, defined as a decrease of 50% or more in chromogranin A levels from baseline and for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid \\[5-HIAA\\], defined as a decrease of 50% or more in urinary 5-HIAA levels from baseline) will be compared between treatment arms among patients with elevated baseline levels of chromogranin A (CGA) and 5-HIAA.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) during screening. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and chest x-ray throughout the trial. Patients may optionally undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At the time of progressive disease, patients may cross-over to Arm I. Patients undergo ECHO or MUGA during screening. Patients also undergo CT, MRI, and chest x-ray throughout the trial. Patients may optionally undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 5 years.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Low- or intermediate-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, including the following subtypes: carcinoid tumor, low- to intermediate-grade or well- to moderately-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma or tumor, atypical carcinoid tumor; documentation from a primary tumor or metastatic site is sufficient; patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, adenocarcinoid tumor, or goblet cell carcinoid tumor are not eligible\n* Locally unresectable or metastatic carcinoid tumors\n* Patients must have histologic documentation or clinical evidence of a carcinoid tumor of primary site (including foregut, midgut, hindgut or other non-pancreatic site); tumors of unknown primary site are eligible provided the treating physician does not suspect medullary thyroid cancer, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, paraganglioma, or pheochromocytoma; unknown primary tumors will be classified as small bowel tumors for the purpose of stratification; functional (associated with a clinical syndrome) or nonfunctional tumors are allowed; target lesions must have shown disease progression if therapy included peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) and PRRT must be completed at least 8 weeks prior to registration\n* Radiological evidence for progressive disease (measurable or non-measurable) within 12 months prior to registration; patients who have received anti-tumor therapy during the past 12 months (including octreotide analogs) must have had radiological documentation of progression of disease while on or after receiving therapy\n* No known endobronchial lesions and/or lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels that increase the risk of pulmonary hemorrhage; patients with lesions infiltrating major pulmonary vessels (contiguous tumor and vessels) are excluded; however, the presence of a tumor that is touching, but not infiltrating (abutting) the vessels is acceptable (computed tomography \\[CT\\] with contrast is strongly recommended to evaluate such lesions);

      "detailed_description": "This is a multi-center, open label, phase IV study to provide continued supply of pasireotide to patients being treated in a current Novartis-sponsored study and who are benefiting from treatment with pasireotide alone or in combination with another treatment for Cushing's Disease and Acromegaly . Eligible patients are to be consented and can then continue treatment with pasireotide alone or in combination with another treatment for Cushing's Disease and Acromegaly in this protocol. All patients at their scheduled visits will have drug dispensing information and reported adverse events and serious adverse events collected.\n\nA patient will reach the end of study when pasireotide treatment is permanently discontinued and the end of treatment visit has been performed. All patients must be followed up for safety evaluations for 3 months following the last dose of pasireotide LAR treatment and for 1 month following the last dose of pasireotide s.c. treatment.\n\nThe study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years or until such time that enrolled patients no longer need treatment with pasireotide or are able to obtain commercial supply according to local regulations for their medical condition.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient is currently participating in a Novartis-sponsored study receiving pasireotide (LAR and/or s.c.) on monotherapy or combination therapy (for Cushing's Disease or Acromegaly), and has fulfilled all required assessments in the parent study and patients that are benefiting from the study treatment have no other alternatives.\n2. Patient is currently benefiting from the treatment with pasireotide, as determined by the investigator\n3. Patient has demonstrated compliance, as assessed by the investigator, with the parent study requirements.\n4. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other study procedures.\n5. Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in roll-over study and receiving study medication.\n\n   * If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient has been permanently discontinued from pasireotide study treatment in the parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance to study procedures, withdrawal of consent or any other reason.\n2. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.\n3. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 30 days after the final dose of pasireotide s.c. and 84 days after the final dose of pasireotide LAR. Highly effective contraception is defined as either:\n\n   * Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n   * Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n   * Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to enrolling). For female patients on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n   * Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate \\<1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\n   * In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.\n   * Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.\n   * Sexually active males, unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 1 months after pasireotide s.c. last dose and 3 months after pasireotide LAR last dose, should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.",

      "brief_summary": "This study will evaluate the response rate of MLN8237 in patients with histologically confirmed or clinically suspected metastatic neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). MLN8237 is an orally administered Aurora kinase A inhibitor that has demonstrated broad antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. In preclinical models, aurora kinase inhibition resulted in dramatic and preferential anti-tumor activity in NEPC with suppression of neuroendocrine marker expression.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a multi-institutional single-arm, open-label Phase 2 trial evaluating MLN8237 in patients with histologically confirmed or clinically suspected metastatic neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Subjects will be treated with MLN8237 at 50 mg twice daily for 7 days repeated every 21 days. Individual dose reductions will be made on the basis of the AEs observed. Therapy will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity as a result of MLN8237, or withdrawal of patient consent. Patients will be followed with history, physical, and blood tests at each visit to monitor for toxicity. Response and progression will be evaluated by CT/MRI scan and bone scan after every 3 cycles and determined using RECIST v1.1. PSA and serum chromogranin A and NSE will be followed every cycle. CTC counts by CellSearch will be performed at baseline, at 4-6 weeks, and upon progression. Patients will be followed for survival endpoints following completion of this study until death.",

Prior anti-cancer therapy with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or not recovered from adverse events (improved to grade 1 or less) due to mAbs administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n5. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks (12 weeks for measurable sites of CNS disease) prior to study Day 1 or not recovered from adverse events (improved to grade 1 or less) due to a previously administered agent. Note: Subjects with neuropathy or ≤ Grade 2 alopecia are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.\n6. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment except superficial malignancies of the skin and in situ cervical cancer\n7. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n8. Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of interstitial lung disease or active non-infectious pneumonitis.\n9. Active infection requiring systemic therapy at enrollment.\n10. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)\n11. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients\n12. Has received a live virus vaccine within 30 days of planned start of trial treatment.\n13. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening period through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n14. Prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand (PDL-1), anti-PD-L2, or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137)\n15.

      "detailed_description": "This was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, two-arm Phase III study comparing the efficacy and safety of everolimus 10 mg daily to placebo in patients with advanced NET of GI or lung origin without a history of, or current symptoms of carcinoid syndrome.\n\nAfter assessment of eligibility, participants qualifying for the study were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either everolimus or matching placebo. Participants received daily oral doses of 10 mg everolimus or matching placebo as study drug. In both arms, the study drug was combined with best supportive care and treatment cycles were defined as 28 days. Participants were treated until disease progression as per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.0, intolerable toxicity, death, lost to follow-up or consent withdrawal. Regardless of the reason for study drug discontinuation, participants had a safety follow-up visit scheduled 30 days after the last dose of the study drug.\n\nPer data monitoring committee recommendation, all participants on treatment with placebo were allowed to crossover to open-label treatment with everolimus. This change was implemented through protocol amendment 3 (issued on 06-May-2016) after which remaining participants entered into open-label phase of the study.",

Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine the objective tumor response rate of BAY 43-9006 (sorafenib tosylate) in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Adverse event rate(s). II. Progression free survival and time to progression. III. Improvement in circulating hormone levels. IV. Overall survival.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are grouped into 2 separate analysis Groups according to tumor type (Group A: Carcinoid; Group B: Islet cell/other well-differentiated tumor). Each Group was independently evaluated for all study endpoints.\n\nPatients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 2 years from study entry.",
