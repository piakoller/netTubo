Nivolumab and Chemotherapy for Resectable PD-L1+ NSCLC | Image Credit: © Karsyarina – stock.adobe.com The European Commission has approved neoadjuvant nivolumab (Opdivo) plus chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant nivolumab for the treatment of patients with resectable, high-risk non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have PD-L1 expression of 1% or greater.1 The decision is based on data from the phase 3 CheckMate 77T trial (NCT04025879) study, which showed a 42% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence, progression, or death with neoadjuvant nivolumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy followed by surgery and adjuvant nivolumab alone, vs neoadjuvant platinum-doublet chemotherapy and placebo followed by surgery and adjuvant placebo in patients with resectable NSCLC (HR for event-free survival [EFS], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78;P= .00025). The 24-month EFS rate was 65% in the nivolumab arm compared with 44% in the placebo arm. The perioperative nivolumab regimen also led to clinically meaningful improvements in the secondary efficacy end points of pathologic complete response (pCR) and major pathologic response (MPR). Additionally, the safety profile of the perioperative regimen was comparable to prior data reported in NSCLC, and no new safety signals were seen. “This approval brings another perioperative immunotherapy treatment option for select patients with resectable NSCLC in the European Union, helping address an ongoing need for interventions that can meaningfully reduce the risk of cancer returning after initial therapy,” Dana Walker, MD, MSCE, vice president, [nivolumab] global program lead, Bristol Myers Squibb, stated in a news release. “With this approval, [nivolumab] with chemotherapy followed by adjuvant [niv...",

To assess which datasets are generating the most anticipation,OncLive®conducted informal polls on social media, querying breast cancer specialists on X and LinkedIn about the late-breaking abstracts they are most eager to see presented during the meeting. Among 28 respondents on X, the phase 3 DESTINY-Breast09 (NCT04784715) and SERENA-6 (NCT04964934) trials garnered the greatest attention, with 46.4% and 39.3% of votes, respectively. The phase 3 VERITAC-2 (NCT05654623) and ASCENT-04 (NCT05382286) trials were also of interest, each cited by 7.1% of respondents. X Breast Cancer Trials Poll On LinkedIn, DESTINY-Breast09 remained the top-ranked abstract among over half (57%) of 58 respondents. However, ASCENT-04 was identified as the second most anticipated abstract in this poll (24%), followed by SERENA-6 (14%) and VERITAC-2 (5%). LinkedIn Breast Cancer Trials Poll Oncologists were also asked to identify the breast cancer subtypes they were most interested in ahead of ASCO. Among 59 X respondents, HER2-positive breast cancer led (39%), followed by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; 32.2%), hormone receptor (HR)–positive disease (20.3%), and early-stage disease (8.5%).

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors have activity against a variety of tumor types. Carfilzomib (Kyprolis®) is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor with a favorable safety profile that has been studied in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. Carfilzomib received accelerated approval from the U.S. FDA in 2012, based on a favorable response rate, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who received at least two prior therapies, and demonstrated disease progression within 60 days of completing the last therapy. In this multi-center study, the investigators propose to evaluate carfilzomib for the treatment of patients with advanced neuroendocrine cancers.",

The somatostatin receptor targeting of the therapeutic will be checked with 68Ga-DOTATOC PET-CT imaging prior to therapy. Treatment consists of 3 cycles, 6-8 weeks apart. Cycle 1 dose is fixed with Cycles 2 and 3 doses to be determined by dosimetry-based calculation of renal doses from previous cycles not to exceed 23 Gy for the total renal dose.\n\nThe goals of this project are to\n\n1. Demonstrate the safety and efficacy of dosimetry-guided peptide receptor radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide in patients with neuroendocrine and other somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.\n2. Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using 90Y-DOTATOC.\n3. Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) or 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT as an accurate technique for diagnosis, staging, treatment targeting, and monitoring response to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.",

Disease not amenable to standard treatment (nonresectable or disease present after one or more surgeries and/or Sandostatin treatment) or subject has failed existing first line chemotherapy, biologic therapy, targeted agent therapy or radiation therapy.\n2. Participation in Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry.\n3. A pathologically confirmed (histology or cytology) malignant neoplasm with at least one target lesion that is confirmed by conventional imaging and is determined to express somatostatin receptors by 68Ga-DOTATOC (TATE) PET within 6 months prior to treatment with 90Y-DOTATOC.\n4. The target lesion is one that either has never received external beam radiation or has been previously irradiated and has since demonstrated progression. Any local irradiation of the target lesion or any non-target lesions via external beam, conformal or stereotactic radiation treatments must have occurred more than 4 weeks prior to study drug administration. Any full cranial-spinal radiation, whether or not a target lesion is included in the field, must have occurred more than 3 months prior to study drug administration.\n5. Life expectancy \\> 2 months at the time of study drug administration.\n6. Archival tissue from a previous biopsy will be required.\n7. Age ≥ 6 months-90 years at the time of study drug administration.\n8. Performance status as determined by Karnofsky ≥ 60 or Lansky Play Scale ≥ 60% at the time of study drug administration.\n9. Completion of Norfolk Quality of Life Questionnaire.\n10. Within 7-10 days of study drug administration, patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n    * absolute neutrophil count \\>1000/mm3\n    * Platelets \\>90,000/mm3\n    * total bilirubin \\<3X ULN for age\n    * AST(SGOT) \\& ALT(SGPT) \\<10X institutional upper limit of normal for age\n    * Urinalysis no greater than 1+ hematuria or proteinuria\n    * Renal function\\* Adults(age18 or \\>): Serum creatinine ≤ 1.2 mg/dl; if serum creatinine is \\>1.2 mg/dL, nuclear GFR will be measured. GFR will need to be ≥ 80 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects ≤40 years old, ≥ 70 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects between 41-50; ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects between 51-60; ≥ 50 ml/min/1.73m2 for subjects \\> 60 years old.\n\n    Children(age \\<18): nuclear GFR ≥ 80 mL/min/1.73 m2\n\n    \\* Renal function criteria based on our previous experience with 90Y-DOTATOC therapy and known changes in GFR with age13,21,33-35\n11. The effects of 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because Class C agents are known to be teratogenic, women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n12. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 90Y-DOTATOC is a Class C agent with potential teratogenic or abortifacient effects.\n2. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with 90Y-DOTATOC, breastfeeding should be discontinued until 6 weeks after the last administration of study drug.\n3. Surgery within 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n4. External beam radiation to both kidneys (scatter doses of \\<500 cGy to a single kidney or radiation to \\< 50% of a single kidney is acceptable).\n5. Prior PRRT with 90Y-DOTATOC (TATE) or 177Lu-DOTATOC (TATE) or 131I-MIBG therapy for this malignancy.\n6. Another investigational drug within 4 weeks of study drug administration.\n7. Concurrent, malignant disease for which patient is on active therapy.\n8. Another significant medical, psychiatric, or surgical condition which is currently uncontrolled by treatment and which would likely affect the subject's ability to complete this protocol.\n9. Any subject for whom, in the opinion of their physician, a 12-hour discontinuation of somatostatin analogue therapy represents a health risk. Also subjects who have received SandostatinLAR in the past 28 days or long-acting lanreotide within the past 8 weeks are excluded. Subjects may be maintained on short acting octreotide during the time from last injection of long-acting somatostatin analogue until 12 hrs prior to injection of study drug. Known antibodies to Octreotide, Lanreotide, or DOTATOC or history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to 90Y-DOTATOC.\n10. Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) of study drug administration or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n11. Uncontrolled illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n12. Subject weighs more than 450 pounds. (Subjects who weigh more than 450 pounds will not be able to fit inside the imaging machines.)\n13. Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time (due to cough, severe arthritis, etc.)",

Adrenal replacement steroid disease are permitted in the absence of autoimmune disease.\n* The participant is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HepBsAg, or HCV RNA. HIV-positive participants with non-detectable viral loads on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cabozantinib and nivolumab.\n* The participant has received a live vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial. Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, mumps, rubella, varicella/zoster, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid vaccine. The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (Fluzone®) is allowed.\n* Pregnant or lactating females are excluded from this study because cabozantinib and nivolumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib and nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantinib and nivolumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n* Sexually active fertile subjects and their partners must agree to use medically accepted methods of contraception (eg, barrier methods, including male condom, female condom, or diaphragm with spermicidal gel) during the course of the study and following treatment. Women of childbearing potential receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of nivolumab. Contraception must be used for 4 months after last dose of cabozantinib.",

One of these trials is designated TRIPLE THREAT ( NCT02489903 ), because it explores the conditioning or priming effect of RRx-001 on three tumor types - non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors - prior to re-administration of platinum doublets. In follow-up to a recent case study, which describes early monotherapeutic benefit with RRx-001 in a refractory EGFR-mutated NSCLC tumor, we present subsequent evidence of a radiological partial response to reintroduced platinum doublets after RRx-001. For the 50% of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who progress on EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (without evidence of a T790M mutations) as well as platinum doublets and pemetrexed/taxane, no other clinically established treatment options exist. A retrial of these therapies in EGFR-positive NSCLC patients via priming with epigenetic agents such as RRx-001 constitutes a strategy to 'episensitize' tumors (i.e. reverse resistance by epigenetic means) and to extend overall survival.

It was broadly classified into three groups based on the initial response to cisplatin/etoposide therapy, platinum-refractory, platinum-resistant, and platinum-sensitive, extensive stage SCLC inevitably relapses, at which point the only standard options are to rechallenge with the first-line chemotherapeutic regimen in the case of sensitive disease or to start the topoisomerase I inhibitor, topotecan. Sensitive disease is defined by a response to the first-line therapy and a treatment-free interval of at least 90 days, while the definitions of refractory and resistant disease, respectively, are nonresponse to the first-line treatment or relapse within 90 days. As an important predictor of response to the second-line treatment, the clinical cutoff of three months (or two months in some cases) for resistant and sensitive disease, which along with performance status prognostically separates patients into high- and low-risk categories, dictates subsequent management. This case report presents a resistant SCLC patient enrolled on a Phase II clinical trial called QUADRUPLE THREAT (formerly TRIPLE THREAT; NCT02489903 ) who responded to reintroduced platinum doublets after sequential priming with the resistance-reversing epi-immunotherapeutic agent, RRx-001.

Platinum-taxane combination is the initial treatment of choice in ovarian cancer and the \"go-to regimen\" for patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive disease. However, platinum resistance is an inevitable and uniformly fatal development. One of the \"Holy Grails\" in ovarian cancer, besides early detection, is to reverse this resistance and retreat with a platinum doublet regimen. Because of the correlation between therapeutic resistance and poor clinical outcomes, this case, which potentially demonstrates a new avenue of anticancer development in epithelial ovarian cancer provided it is repeatable with other ovarian patients, was felt to merit a report.

Nevertheless, despite these common characteristics, NETs differ widely in terms of their natural histories: high-grade NETs are clinically aggressive and, like small cell lung cancer, which they most closely resemble, tend to respond to cisplatin and etoposide. In contrast, low-grade NETs, which as a rule progress and behave indolently, do not. In either case, the treatment strategy, apart from potentially curative surgical resection, is very poorly defined. This report describes the case of a 28-year-old white male with a diagnosis of high-grade NET of undetermined primary site metastatic to the lymph nodes, skin and paraspinal soft tissues, treated with the experimental anticancer agent RRx-001, in the context of a phase II clinical trial called TRIPLE THREAT ( NCT02489903 ); serial sampling of tumor material through repeat biopsies demonstrated an intratumoral inflammatory response, including the amplification of infiltrating T cells, which correlated with clinical and symptomatic benefit. This case suggests that pseudoprogression or RRx-001-induced enlargement of tumor lesions, which has been previously described for several RRx-001-treated patients, is the result of tumoral lymphocyte infiltration.

In general, the longer-lived the responses in first line, the better the outcome in second line, with the opposite prognosis for shorter-lived responses. Resistant SCLC is defined as relapse within 90 days of platinum-doublet treatment, and predictably correlates with shortened survival compared with sensitive disease, defined as relapse after 90 days. Case report: We present a patient with platinum-resistant SCLC that was rechallenged with cisplatin/etoposide in the context of the clinical trial TRIPLE THREAT ( NCT02489903 ) after treatment with, and progression on, the resistance-reversing anticancer agent RRx-001. Conclusion: The prolonged partial response of this platinum-resistant SCLC to reintroduced carboplatin/etoposide after RRx-001 belies and contradicts the prevailing orthodoxy in oncology that rechallenge with chemotherapy after the emergence of resistance is an exercise in futility and risk, which potentially exposes patients to toxicity without benefit. © 2016 S.

Methods: Patients were treated with RRx-001 4 mg IV on day 1 of each week of a 21-day cycle followed at progression by re-challenge with etoposide 80-100 IV mg/m 2 on days 1, 2 and 3 and cisplatin 60-80 mg/m 2 IV on day 1 or carboplatin AUC 5-6 IV on day 1, every 21 days. The primary end points were overall survival (OS) and overall response rate to platinum regimen. Results: Twenty-six patients were enroled and received at least one dose of RRx-001. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 2 (range 1-9) and 19 (73.1%) patients had platinum-resistant disease. In the intention-to-treat population, one patient (3.8%) had complete response and six (23.1%) had partial response on platinum plus etoposide. The estimated median and 12-month OS from enrolment were 8.6 months and 44.1%, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event from RRx-001 was mild discomfort at the infusion site (23%). Conclusions: RRx-001 followed by re-challenge with platinum plus etoposide chemotherapy is feasible and associated with promising results. Clinical trial registration: NCT02489903 .

In light of its dismal prognosis, and lack of curative options, new therapies for extensive-disease SCLC are desperately needed. Methods: RRx-001 is a small molecule Myc inhibitor and down-regulates CD47 expression on tumor cells. We evaluated the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) pre and post RRx-001 treatment in a phase 2 clinical trial, called QUADRUPLE THREAT, where patients with previously treated SCLC received RRx-001 in combination with a platinum doublet. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02489903 . Fourteen patients with SCLC were analyzed to investigate the association between clinical outcome and PD-L1 expression on CTCs pre and post RRx-001. The correlation between the binary clinical outcome (clinical benefit vs. progressive disease) and the change of PD-L1 expression on CTCs after RRx-001 was analyzed using a logistic regression adjusting for baseline PD-L1 expression. Results: The logistic model McFadden goodness of fit score was 0.477. The logistic model analyzing the association between decreased PD-L1 expression on CTCs after RRx-001 and response to reintroduced platinum doublet had an approximate 92.8% accuracy in its prediction of clinical benefit. The estimated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) displayed a ROC area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.99). Conclusions: These results suggest that PD-L1 expression on CTCs decreased after RRx-001 was significantly correlated with response to reintroduced platinum-based doublet therapy. Monitoring PD-L1 expression on CTCs during RRx-001 treatment may serve as a biomarker ...",

      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and schedule.\n\nYou will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each cycle is 28 days.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle: questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).\n\nUrine tests will be performed every other cycle.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.\n\nAfter the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed: questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test, EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.",

This trial investigated the activity of Ziv-aflibercept, a recombinant protein that binds to and inhibits the activity of VEGF, in patients with advanced NETs ( NCT01782443 ). Methods: A single-arm, phase II trial enrolling patients with advanced, progressive extrapancreatic NET. Patients were treated with Ziv-aflibercept 4 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle; the starting dose was reduced to 2 mg/kg on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle because of hypertension-related events. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Results: The trial enrolled 19 patients (13 male:6 female). Patients received a median of 7 cycles (range, 1-18 cycles). The median progression free survival was 11.8 months (95% confidence interval, 3.2-16.1 months), and the median overall survival was 36.4 months (95% confidence interval, 16.1-not reached). Best responses by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 are as follows: 1 (5%) partial response, 13 (68%) stable disease, 2 (10%) with progressive disease, and 3 (15%) unevaluable. Hypertension occurred in 18 patients (95%), including grade 3-4 hypertension in 12 patients (63%). Conclusions: Although the progression free survival is similar to other VEGF inhibitors in NET, toxicity may preclude further investigation. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well berzosertib (M6620) works when given in combination with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) compared with topotecan alone in treating patients with small cell lung cancer that has come back (relapsed), or small cell cancer that arises from a site other than the lung (extrapulmonary). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work by damaging the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in tumor cells, causing those cells to die and the tumor to shrink. However, some tumor cells can become less affected by chemotherapy because they have ways to repair the damaged DNA. The addition of M6620 could help topotecan hydrochloride shrink the cancer and prevent it from returning by blocking enzymes needed for DNA repair.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine if the combination of berzosertib (M6620) with topotecan hydrochloride (topotecan) will result in an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) compared to topotecan alone in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To determine the objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) with the combination of M6220 and topotecan in patients with relapsed SCLC and extrapulmonary small cell cancers.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To perform molecular profiling assays on malignant and normal tissues, including, but not limited to ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNA-Seq):\n\nIa. To assess expression of genes Schlafen family member 11 (SLFN11), MYC, and ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) among others.\n\nIb. To identify potential predictive biomarkers of response to a combination of M6620 with topotecan.\n\nIc. Identify mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)- and RNA-based assessment platforms.\n\nII. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.\n\nIII. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients at the Early-Phase and Experimental Clinical Trials (EET) Biobank at Nationwide Children's Hospital.\n\nIV. To characterize circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and circulating tumor cells in patients with relapsed SCLC and extrapulmonary small cell cancers.\n\nV. To identify potential predictive biomarkers of response to a combination of M6620 with topotecan in patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts.\n\nCOHORT I: Patient with SCLC are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Participants receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants may crossover to Arm II at disease progression. Participants undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan during screening and on study as well as a tumor biopsy during screening. Participants may also undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Participants receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and berzosertib (M6620) IV over 60 minutes on days 2 and 5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants undergo a CT scan during screening and on study as well as a tumor biopsy during screening. Participants may also undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nCOHORT II (Patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancer): Participants receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and berzosertib (M6620) IV over 60 minutes on days 2 and 5. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Participants undergo a CT scan during screening and on study as well as a tumor biopsy during screening. Participants may also undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients enrolled to the primary cohort must have limited- or extensive-disease SCLC at diagnosis, with relapse at study entry with measurable disease at random assignment per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. Both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant patients will be included\n* Patients with extrapulmonary small cell cancers (cancers with small cell morphology and arising outside the lung, such as small cell prostate, bladder, etc.) will be eligible for the exploratory cohort\n* Patients must be \\>= 18 years of age because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of M6620 in combination with topotecan in patients \\<18 years of age\n* Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =\\< 2 (Karnofsky \\>= 60%)\n* Hemoglobin \\>= 9.0 g/dL - patients may receive transfusion to meet the hemoglobin (Hb) eligibility\n* Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \\>= 1,500/mcL\n* Platelets \\>= 100,000/mcL\n* Total bilirubin =\\< 2 mg/dL\n* Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase \\[SGOT\\])/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase \\[SGPT\\]) =\\< 3.0 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n* Creatinine =\\< institutional ULN OR\n* Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \\>= 60 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2 unless data exists supporting safe use at lower kidney function values, no lower than 30 mL/min/1.73 m\\^2\n* Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive subjects on combination antiretroviral therapy are eligible as long as they are on effective anti-retroviral therapy with undetectable viral load within 6 months and there is no drug-drug interaction with M6220\n* For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated\n* Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis are not eligible due to their extremely poor prognosis and since it is unclear whether the investigational agent penetrates the blood-brain barrier. However, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days may be enrolled\n* Patients who have received prior topotecan therapy\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n  * Note: Patients who have had palliative radiotherapy may be included as long as they have recovered from any radiotherapy related adverse events (allow at least a week between radiotherapy completion and study treatment)\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy except hair loss and peripheral neuropathy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1)\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to M6620 or topotecan used in study\n* M6620 is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) should be avoided. Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or of which to minimize use. The Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card should be provided to patients. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 as a DDR inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620. These potential risks may also apply to topotecan used in this study\n* Patients with high grade neuroendocrine cancers, but with no small cell morphology will not be eligible\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome will not be eligible",

A phase 2 study showed antitumor activity with the addition of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase inhibitor berzosertib to topotecan. Objective: To investigate whether the addition of berzosertib to topotecan improves clinical outcomes for patients with relapsed SCLC. Design, setting, and participants: Between December 1, 2019, and December 31, 2022, this open-label phase 2 randomized clinical trial recruited 60 patients with SCLC and relapse after 1 or more prior therapies from 16 US cancer centers. Patients previously treated with topotecan were not eligible. Interventions: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone (group 1), 1.25 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 through 5, or with berzosertib (group 2), 210 mg/m2 intravenously on days 2 and 5, in 21-day cycles. Randomization was stratified by tumor sensitivity to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Main outcomes and measures: The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) in the overall population and among patients with platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant tumors. The PFS and OS for each treatment group were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used to compare PFS and OS between the 2 groups, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the treatment hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI. Results: Of 60 patients (median [range] age, 59 [34-79] years; 33 [55%] male) included in this study, 20 were randomly assigned to receive topotecan alone and 40 to receive a combination of topotecan with berzosertib. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 21.3 (18.1-28.3) months, there was no diff...",

Evaluate the best overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 (investigator-reported).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n1. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab-based therapy in this patient population.\n2. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in participants receiving pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.\n3. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in participants treated with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (median PFS and 18 wk PFS).\n4. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in participants receiving pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPart A: Participants are treated with pembrolizumab alone. An adaptive Simon's two-stage design was used, and the overall plan hinges on the activity of single agent pembrolizumab in the first stage of Part A. If there is sufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will expand to the second stage of Part A and forgo Part B. If there is insufficient activity in the first stage of Part A, the study will proceed to the first stage of Part B (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy).\n\nPart B: Participants are treated with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (physician's choice, paclitaxel or irinotecan). Patients with stable disease (SD) or better after 9 cycles (27 weeks) of pembrolizumab-based therapy will have the option to continue with pembrolizumab alone, unless the first partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) is noted at 27 weeks.\n\nAll participants will undergo a pre-treatment tumor biopsy (unless the tumor is inaccessible and/or a biopsy is not felt to be in the participant's best interest). Participants may continue study treatment until progressive disease (PD), unacceptable adverse events, inter-current illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's decision to withdraw the participant, the participant withdraws consent, pregnancy of the participant, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements, participant receives 35 treatments (approximately 2 years) of pembrolizumab, or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment.",

The efficacy of CPI in combination with chemotherapy remains under investigation. Methods: Patients with advanced, progressive EP-PDNECs were enrolled in a two-part study of pembrolizumab-based therapy. In Part A, patients received pembrolizumab alone. In Part B, patients received pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. Primary endpoint: objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints: safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Tumours were profiled for programmed death-ligand 1 expression, microsatellite-high/mismatch repair deficient status, mutational burden (TMB), genomic correlates. Tumour growth rate was evaluated. Results: Part A (N = 14): ORR (pembrolizumab alone) 7% (95% CI, 0.2-33.9%), median PFS 1.8 months (95% CI, 1.7-21.4), median OS 7.8 months (95% CI, 3.1-not reached); 14% of patients (N = 2) had grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Part B (N = 22): ORR (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy) 5% (95% CI, 0-22.8%), median PFS 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.9-3.4), median OS 4.8 months (95% CI, 4.1-8.2); 45% of patients (N = 10) had grade 3/4 TRAEs. The two patients with objective response had high-TMB tumours. Discussion: Treatment with pembrolizumab alone and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was ineffective in advanced, progressive EP-PDNECs.

Martin Wermke, MD, group leader, Thoracic Oncology Group, professor for experimental cancer therapy, head of the Early Clinical Trial Unit and of the Trial Management National Center for Tumor Diseases Dresden (NCT/UCC) Clinical Trial Center, highlighted the clinical potential of obrixtamig, a DLL3/CD3-directed bispecific T-cell engager, in combination with topotecan for the treatment of patients with advanced small cell lung cancer (SCLC), based on early-phase data from the ongoing phase 1 DAREON-9 trial (NCT05990738). The trial utilized a step-up dosing strategy for obrixtamig to mitigate immune-mediated toxicities. The study enrolled patients who progressed after 1 or more lines of platinum-based treatment with or without a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor. Three dose levels of obrixtamig were evaluated in the study. Interim results showed an encouraging overall response rate (ORR) of 70% (95% CI, 47%-87%), with responses maintained at 69% (95% CI, 39%-91%) among the 13 patients who underwent confirmatory imaging. Wermke noted that these early findings may suggest synergistic activity between obrixtamig and topotecan, warranting further exploration. Wermke noted that safety outcomes were consistent with expectations based on the known toxicity profiles of each agent alone. Topotecan-associated cytopenias were reported, including neutropenia (68%) and thrombocytopenia (92%), though no associated infectious or bleeding complications occurred. Obrixtamig-related cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 48% of patients; these were mostly grade 1 effects (44%), with a few grade 2 cases (4%). No grade 3 or higher CRS was observed. Additionally, neurotoxicity including immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity s...",

These findings support the potential role of ivonescimab as a novel first-line treatment option for patients with advanced squamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression status. \"It is a great honor for us to witness ivonescimab once again successfully challenge the optimal standard of care. This breakthrough not only advances the treatment of NSCLC but also marks a significant milestone in global oncology immunotherapy,\" Shun Lu, MD, PhD, director of Shanghai Lung Cancer, Shanghai Chest Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, and principal investigator of the HARMONi-6 study, stated in a news release. Regarding safety, no new safety signals were reported with ivonescimab, and the rates of grade 3 or higher bleeding adverse effects were comparable between the 2 arms. Full data are expected to be presented at an upcoming medical meeting in 2025. \"The interim analysis results from the HARMONi-6 study show that ivonescimab in combination with chemotherapy significantly prolonged PFS compared to tislelizumab with chemotherapy,” Lu continued. “In patients with up to 63% central squamous carcinoma, ivonescimab demon...",

      "brief_summary": "This phase III trial studies cabozantinib to see how well it works compared with placebo in treating patients with neuroendocrine or carcinoid tumors that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Cabozantinib is a chemotherapy drug known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and it targets specific tyrosine kinase receptors, that when blocked, may slow tumor growth.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether cabozantinib (cabozantinib S-malate) can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nIII. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).\n\nIV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors using CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE.\n\nV. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nVI. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nOTHER OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Results of the primary analysis will be examined for consistency, while taking into account the stratification factors and/or covariates of baseline quality of life (QOL) and fatigue.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare overall quality of life, disease-related symptoms, and other domains between the two treatment groups (cabozantinib versus \\[vs.\\] placebo) within each cohort of patients (pancreatic NET vs. carcinoid tumor). (Quality of Life Substudy Objective - A021602-HO1)\n\nPOPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To describe the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response relationships of cabozantinib in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors. (Population Pharmacokinetics Substudy Objective - A021602-PP1)\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and CT, MRI, and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study. Patients may crossover to receive cabozantinib S-malate at the time of disease progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks until disease progression or start of new anticancer therapy, and then every 6 months until 8 years after registration.",

The efficacy of cabozantinib in the treatment of previously treated, progressive extrapancreatic or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors is unclear. Methods: We enrolled two independent cohorts of patients - those with extrapancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and those with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors - who had received peptide receptor radionuclide therapy or targeted therapy or both. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive cabozantinib at a dose of 60 mg daily or placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival as assessed by blinded independent central review. Key secondary end points included objective response, overall survival, and safety. Results: In the cohort of 203 patients with extrapancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, the median progression-free survival with cabozantinib was 8.4 months, as compared with 3.9 months with placebo (stratified hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.59; P<0.001). In the cohort of 95 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, the median progression-free survival with cabozantinib was 13.8 months, as compared with 4.4 months with placebo (stratified hazard ratio, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.42; P<0.001). The incidence of confirmed objective response with cabozantinib was 5% and 19% among patients with extrapancreatic and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, respectively, as compared with 0% with placebo. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were noted in 62 to 65% of the patients treated with cabozantinib, as compared with 23 to 27% of the patients who received placebo. Common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher included hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, and thromboembolic events. Conclusions: Cabozantinib, as compared with placebo, significantly improved progression-f...",

The March 26, 2025,FDA approval was based on data from the phase 3 CABINET trial(NCT03375320), which evaluated the efficacy and safety of cabozantinib vs placebo in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic pNET/epNET that had progressed on prior treatment (n = 298). The study included pNET (n = 99) and epNET (n = 199) cohorts, which randomly assigned the respective patients 2:1 to receive either cabozantinib or placebo.1 “To have an [FDA approval cover a] broad range of primary tumor sites is wonderful to see, as it also covers patients who have functional tumors or nonfunctional tumors, and those who may have somatostatin receptor–positive or –negative disease,” Chan said in an interview withOncLive®. “There weren’t many restrictions in the approval, which means that it’s [now] a standard option for a large number of patients.” In the pNET cohort, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 13.8 months (95% CI, 8.9-17.0) vs 3.3 months (95% CI, 2.8-5.7) in the cabozantinib and placebo arms, respectively (HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.12-0.41;P<.0001).

Below is your guide to all oncologic therapies approved by the European Commission (EC) in July 2025, including the pivotal clinical data behind each decision. Read on to learn more! The EC granted conditional marketing authorization to the HER2-directed bispecific antibody zanidatamab-hrii (Ziihera) for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic HER2-positive (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+) biliary tract cancer (BTC) who received at least 1 previous line of systemic therapy.1 Data from the phase 2b HERIZON-BTC-01 trial (NCT04466891) supported this regulatory decision. In cohort 1 (n = 80), at a median follow-up of 21.9 months, the confirmed overall response rate (ORR) per independent central review (ICR) was 41.3% (95% CI, 30.4%-52.8%); this included 2 patients who achieved a complete response. The median overall survival (OS) was 15.5 months (95% CI, 10.4-18.5), and the median duration of response (DOR) was 14.9 months (95% CI, 7.4-not reached). With this approval, zanidatamab is now the first HER2-targeted therapy to receive conditional approval for HER2-positive BTC in the European Union (EU). Its continued approval for this indication is contingent upon validation of clinical benefit in the phase 3 HERIZON-BTC-302 trial (NCT06282575). The EC approved tislelizumab (Tevimbra) plus gemcitabine/cisplatin for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic or recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma that is not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy.2 Results from the phase 3 RATIONALE-309 trial (NCT03924986) supported this regulatory decision.

      "detailed_description": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of ramucirumab in advanced, progressive carcinoid tumors.\n\nCancer cells can make growth factors that cause the abnormal growth of new blood vessels. Ramucirumab is an investigational drug which works by blocking a receptor for a vascular growth factor, thereby preventing new blood vessels from forming. This may stop the cancer from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ramucirumab for treatment of Carcinoid Tumors.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed low- to intermediate-grade neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid tumor).\n* Carcinoid tumors of any site are eligible. Patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are excluded.\n* Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam. See Section 10 for the evaluation of measurable disease.\n* Locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic disease.\n* Patients must have evidence of radiographic disease progression within the past 12 months. Progressive disease by RECIST criteria is not required.\n* Age ≥ 18 years.\n* ECOG performance status 0-1 (see Appendix A).\n* Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n  * absolute neutrophil count ≥1,000/ mm3\n  * platelets ≥100,000/ mm3\n  * hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL\n  * total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal\n  * AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit of normal, or ≤ 5× institutional upper limit of normal in the setting of liver metastases\n  * creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal\n  * urinary protein ≤ 1+ on dipstick or routine urinalysis (if urine dipstick or routine urinalysis is 2+, a 24-hour urine collection for protein must demonstrate \\<1000 mg of protein in 24 hours)\n  * coagulation function Adequate coagulation function as defined by International Normalized Ratio (INR) ≤ 1.5 and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) \\< 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal. Patients on full-dose anticoagulation must be on a stable dose (minimum duration 14 days) of oral anticoagulant or low molecular weight heparin.\n  * The effects of ramucirumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because anti-antiangiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of Ramucirumab administration.\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n* Patients who have undergone major surgery within 28 days or subcutaneous venous access device placement within 7 days prior to study enrollment.\n* Patients with elective or planned major surgery to be performed during the course of the clinical trial.\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.\n* Patients with any Grade 3-4 gastrointestinal bleeding within 3 months prior to enrollment.\n* Patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or any other significant thromboembolism (venous port or catheter thrombosis or superficial venous thrombosis are not considered \"significant\") during the 3 months prior to registration.\n* Patients who have experienced any arterial thromboembolic events, including but not limited to myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, or unstable angina, within 6 months prior to enrollment.\n* Patients with uncontrolled or poorly-controlled hypertension (\\>160 mmHg systolic or \\> 100 mmHg diastolic for \\>4 weeks) despite standard medical management.\n* Patients who have congestive heart failure (NYHA Class III or IV), sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, clinically significant bradycardia, advanced heart block within the six months preceding enrollment.\n* Patients who have cirrhosis at a level of Child-Pugh B (or worse) or cirrhosis (any degree) and a history of hepatic encephalopathy or clinically meaningful ascites resulting from cirrhosis.\n* Patients with a serious or nonhealing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture within 28 days prior to enrollment.\n* Patients receiving chronic antiplatelet therapy, including aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, and others), dipyridamole or clopidogrel, or similar agents. Once-daily aspirin use (maximum dose 325 mg/day) is permitted.\n* Patients with uncontrolled brain or leptomeningeal metastases, including patients who continue to require glucocorticoids for brain or leptomeningeal metastases.\n* Patients with prior or concurrent malignancy except for the following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or other adequately treated in situ cancer, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years.\n* Patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis.\n* Patients who have any severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions or other conditions that could affect their participation in the study such as:\n\n  * Severely impaired lung function\n  * Any active (acute or chronic) or uncontrolled infection/ disorders.\n  * Nonmalignant medical illnesses that are uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by the treatment with the study therapy\n  * Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to ramucirumab .\n* Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because ramucirumab is associated with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ramucirumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ramucirumab. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.",

This trial investigated the activity of ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) and inhibits activity of VEGF, in combination with somatostatin analog therapy in patients (pts) with advanced extra-pancreatic NET. Methods: We conducted a single-arm phase II trial enrolling pts with advanced, progressive extra-pancreatic NET. Patients were treated with ramucirumab 8 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints toxicity, radiographic and biochemical tumor response rate, and overall survival (OS). Results: The trial enrolled 43 patients. Primary tumor sites included small intestine 20 (46%), lung 10 (23%), thymus 3 (7%), rectum 1(2%), kidney 1(2%), and unknown primary 8(18%). Median PFS was 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.0-25.6 months), and median OS was 24.9 months (95% CI, 20.7-43.1 months). Best response by RECIST 1.1: partial response 5% (95% CI, 0.6%-15.8%). Chromogranin A levels dropped by at least 50% in 10% of the 37 patients who had elevated levels at baseline. Most common all-grade adverse events included fatigue (84%) and hypertension (84%). Conclusion: Ramucirumab demonstrated efficacy and safety in this single-arm phase II trial. These findings support the continued evaluation of angiogenesis inhibitors in the treatment of NET.

Pre-clinical data demonstrates a potential synergistic role for cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 inhibition and everolimus to treat this disease. In this phase II multicenter study, patients with advanced foregut WDNETs received combination ribociclib and everolimus until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The first 12 patients received ribociclib 300 mg three weeks in a row with a 1 week break and everolimus 2.5 mg daily (recommended phase II dose). Due to unexpected hematologic and infectious toxicities, the trial was put on hold, modified, and an additional 9 patients received ribociclib 200 mg and everolimus 2.5 mg daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Archived pre-treatment tumor was profiled by next-generation sequencing to evaluate for genomic markers of drug response. Twenty-one patients were treated (median age, 56; range, 24 to 77). The study did not meet the pre-specified criteria to advance to stage two. No patients experienced an objective response. Thirteen patients (62%) experienced stable disease. Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months (95% CI, 2.8 months to not reached). Eleven of the first 12 patients (92%) developed grade 2 or more myelosuppression. Ten patients (84%) experienced treatment interruption and 8 patients (67%) required dose reduction. Genetic testing in archival tumor tissue samples failed to identify a predictive biomarker of disease stabilization. The combination of ribociclib and everolimus had insufficient activity to warrant further investigation in foregut WDNETs. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03070301 .

The hypothesis is that HG-NEC (excluding small cell carcinoma) can be segregated based on mutational analysis and that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assignment of therapy is feasible and will potentially improve the outcomes.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nThere is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.\n\nLCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015 World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.\n\nLCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.\n\nBased on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).\n\nSimilarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.\n\nTreatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent, driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently defined a new subtype of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in large-cell carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example.\n\nTo date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapies for metastatic HG-NECs, based on mutational profiles. This study will utilize recent genomic profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of optimal treatments.",

Due to its rarity there is a lacuna in our understanding of LCNEC's molecular biology. In 2016, Rekhtman and colleagues presented one of the largest molecular sequencing series of pulmonary LCNEC. They differentiated genomic profiles of LCNEC into two major subsets: small cell lung cancer (SCLC)-like, characterized by TP53 + RB1 co-mutation/loss, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-like, characterized by the lack of co-altered TP53 + RB1. This finding is of significance because at present LCNEC patients are often treated like SCLC. However, the universal genomic SCLC biomarker of TP53 and RB1 co-mutation was only found in 40% of their cohort. Since then various other scientists have looked into molecular profiling of LCNEC with markedly discordant results. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of publicly available next generation sequencing (NGS) data to evaluate the prevalence of TP53 + RB1 co-mutation in LCNEC. Method: We conducted a literature search using PubMed. Seven studies including 302 patients with pulmonary LCNEC and four studies including 20 patients with extra-pulmonary LCNEC underwent final analysis. Results: The prevalence of TP53 + RB1 co-mutation was 36% (109/302) among pulmonary LCNEC patients and 35% (7/20) among the extra-thoracic LCNEC cohort. This finding is in stark contrast to >90% TP53 + RB1 co-mutation in SCLC. Conclusion: It is now well established that LCNEC is molecularly distinct from SCLC. LCNEC seems to have two molecularly defined sub-cohort based on TP53 + RB1 co-mutation status. Future studies should look into prognostic and predictive implication of TP53 + RB1 co-mutation status in LCNEC. Prospective studies should be designed to characterize molec...",

Image credit: Axel Kock – stock.adobe.com The use of durvalumab (Imfinzi) as a consolidation therapy improved progression-free survival (PFS) over placebo in patients with locally advanced, unresectable non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who did not experience disease progression after concurrent or sequential platinum-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT), according to data from the phase 3 PACIFIC-5 study (NCT03706690) presented during the2024 ESMO Asia Congress.1 At a median follow-up of in censored patients who received durvalumab (n = 252) was 35.7 months vs 30.5 months in those who received placebo (n = 129). The median PFS was 14.0 months (95% CI, 10.9-18.0) by blinded independent central review (BICR) in the durvalumab arm vs 6.5 months (95% CI, 5.4-13.8) in the placebo arm, translating to a 25% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.99;P= .038). Subgroup analysis showed consistent PFS benefit irrespective of whether patients had received concurrent or sequential CRT. In those who received concurrent CRT, the median PFS with durvalumab (n = 168) was 16.5 months (95% CI, 11.0-26.9) by BICR vs 9.5 months (95% CI, 5.6-16.6) with placebo (n = 90; HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.55-1.06;P= .103). In those who received sequential CRT, the median PFS in the durvalumab (n = 84) and placebo (n = 39) arms was 11.0 months (95% CI, 5.6-16.4) and 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.6-7.9), respectively (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.49-1.18;P= .213). A trend toward improved overall survival (OS) was also observed with durvalumab vs placebo, at a median OS of 38.3 months (95% CI, 28.9-42.8) and 32.5 months (95% CI, 20.6-40.4), respectively (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.66-1.17;P= .346). “PACIFIC-5 supports the use of consolidation immunotherapy after either concurrent or...",

      "brief_summary": "It is well known that the prevalence of malnutrition or risk of malnutrition in cancer patients is high, as well as its impact on different parameters such as hospitalization, survival or response to certain treatments. In patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), due to their heterogeneity and longer survival, it is expected that the prevalence of malnutrition is probably underdiagnosed, as well as the existence of a negative impact on different parameters (quality of life, survival). So far, the studies carried out on nutrition and NET are very scarce and none has been carried out so far in Spain.\n\nBefore being able to carry out nutritional intervention studies on these patients, it is necessary to know the reality of the nutritional status of patients with NETs in Spain. The main motivation for the NUTRIGETNE study is to evaluate the epidemiological status of nutrition in NETs in the spanish population. In addition to know the epidemiological picture, it is intended to study the nutritional status from different points of view: analytical, clinical, anthropometric, etc. Besides, the study of nutritional status will allow us to closely monitor the patients who have a higher risk of malnutrition and to propose early interventions for those, as well as the impact of their nutritional status on different parameters: survival, hospitalization, quality of life or responses to the treatments.\n\nNUTRIGETNE is a cross-sectional, open and multicenter study in which the nutritional status of patients with GEP NET in Spain will be evaluated.",

It is planned to include 400 GEP NET patients. Patients will be included consecutively when visiting the corresponding health centers for outpatient visits or hospitalization.\n\nThe study comprises 3 stages with a total duration of 10 to 40 days for the participation of each subject in the study:\n\nScreening visit, First day (day 0): The initial screening will take place on the first day the patient visits the hospital. The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to assess the eligibility of the patient. The implications of the study will be explained to the patient and the informed consent will be signed.\n\nVisit for assessment of nutritional status (days 0-10): taking a medical history, complete physical examination including anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and dynamometry, as well as laboratory analysis. The evaluation of the nutritional status will be carried out by a registered nutritionist, specialized nurse or specialist doctor (variable depending on the characteristics of the center).\n\nData collection (day 10-40): collection of analytical, anthropometric, BIA, dynamometry and clinical results and introduction into the electronic case report form (eCRF).\n\nAfter the end of recruitment and database lock, all data will be subsequently analyzed and presented when applicable through study reports and scientific communications.",

Three patients had partial responses (PRs) with respective target lesion shrinkages of 89%, 78%, and 56%. At a median follow-up of 4.6 months (range, 1.4-7.4) for 9 total patients, the median overall survival was not reached, and 6 of the 9 patients were still alive. Among patients with activated B-cell–like (ABC) DLBCL (n = 6), 4 patients responded and 1 had stable disease, translating to a disease control rate of 83%. “These results represent a promising step forward in improving outcomes for [patients with] DLBCL and underscores the potential of [tambiciclib] in combination with zanubrutinib to deliver meaningful clinical benefits,” Angelos Stergiou, MD, ScD hc, president and chief executive officer of SELLAS Life Sciences Group, stated in a news release. “Achieving an ORR that significantly exceeds expectations, along with a CR response and multiple PRs is a testament to the power of collaboration and innovation in tackling this challenging disease. We believe that the combination of [tambiciclib] and zanubrutinib demonstrates a synergy that could pave the way for more effective treatment options.

The duration of screening could be as short as one day but could not exceed 7 days. Patients who showed potassium level \\> 6.0 mmol/L (\\> 5.5 mmol/L for Poland only) at screening could have their potassium level corrected and could be re-screened afterwards.\n\nTreatment Phase:\n\nEligible patients were admitted to the in-clinic unit and dosed with arginine/lysine solution for infusion of 1,000 mL, which was administered intravenously over a period of 4 hours. Before the infusion (at 0 h time point), a set of baseline tests were performed. During and after the infusion, patient condition was monitored for evaluation of any adverse events. Only patients with a potassium level of ≤ 6 mmol/L at screening (\\> 5.5 mmol/L for Poland only) were allowed to be dosed. Potassium testing on the infusion day was performed at 0h (before the infusion), and at 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, and 24h after the start of infusion. Vital signs and ECGs were taken as specified in the assessment schedule. All patients were monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia, e.g. dyspnoea, weakness, numbness, chest pain and cardiac manifestations (conduction abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias). Other common adverse reactions during arginine/lysine solution administration are nausea and vomiting. Before the start of arginine/lysine solution infusion, an intravenous bolus of an anti-emetic was given. The choice of anti-emetic drugs was at the discretion of the physician.\n\nFollow-up Phase:\n\nAll patients were called for a safety follow-up in 48 hours after dosing. Patients were not scheduled to receive repeat dosing with arginine/lysine solution as concomitant medication with Lutathera® within 7 days of the arginine/lysine solution infusion in the study.",

Investigators also want to learn if ONC201 can prevent new deposits of cancer from appearing in new places in participants (metastases). A phase 2 study of ONC201 in PC-PG (pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma) and other neuroendocrine tumors will determine whether inhibition of DRD2 (a member of the dopamine receptor family) is safe in unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, refractory, or metastatic neuroendocrine cancers including PC-PG, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), Ewing sarcoma (PNET) or any other neuroendicrine tumor with a catecholamine or dopamine biomarker or autocrine or paracrine dependence on dopamine including cholangiocarcinoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma.\n\nONC201 is an investigational (experimental) agent and has a favorable safety profile in phase 1 and early phase 2 clinical trials in advanced cancers. This study design has been chosen to see whether ONC201 is associated with reduction of anti-hypertension medications, safety and significant efficacy against neuroendocrine tumors, especially PC-PG.",

The same CT or MRI imaging to assess disease burden at study entry will be compared at week 6 and 3 months. Patients without progression at 3 months will continue treatment and have imaging at 6, 9 and 12 months after study entry. Metabolic response and/or biomarkers will be compared with study entry PET-CT and scans at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months.\n\nSecondary Objectives Progression - free Survival: This will be calculated according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) or development of new disease\n\nOverall survival: Overall survival will be determined by email or telephone contact.\n\nStudy Design: Phase 2 open-label fixed dose study Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors including PC-PG are rare diseases.\n\nThe current recommended phase II dose of 625 mg orally on 2 consecutive days every week will be used. The same imaging at study entry will be used at subsequent time points (CT or MRI for week 6 and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) Imaging modality choice will be influenced by the quality of prior scans of the subject and will be ordered so clinical comparison is possible.\n\nBecause of travel and lodging considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, some information by the study team/PI may be obtained using virtual visits and 2nd read of scans sent to Cleveland Clinic",

ONC201 is a bitopic DRD2 antagonist with preclinical ONC201 activity in desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT). Patients and methods: Patients (N = 30) with neuroendocrine tumors were treated on this investigator-initiated trial ( NCT03034200 ). ONC201 dose and schedule were 625 mg orally weekly in cohorts A (PC-PG) + B (other neuroendocrine tumors) and 625 mg orally on 2 consecutive days each week in cohort C, which included 5 responding patients. The primary endpoint was radiographic response measured using RECIST. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Results: In arm A (n = 10; all PC-PG), 50% (5/10) exhibited a partial response (PR) and 2 additional patients had stable disease (SD) >3 months. Median duration of therapy for arm A patients was 9 months (range: 1.5-33 months) with 5 patients treated >1 year. In arm B (n = 12), there were 1 PR (DSRCT) and 2 SD (DSRCT; neuroblastoma) >3 months. Median duration of therapy in arm A was 18 months (range: 1-33 months) and arm B was 3 months (range: 1.5-33 months). Arm C PC-PG (N = 8) showed 1 PR and 7 SD at 3 months, with median duration of therapy >10 months. There was no decline in Karnofsky performance status at week 12 for 28 of 30 patients and no dose modification due to treatment-related adverse events. Conclusions: Oral ONC201 was well tolerated in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and associated with clinical benefit, including tumor responses, particularly in some patients with DSRCT and the majority of patients with PC-PG.

PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib and cediranib may help treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",

To evaluate association of homologous recombination deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) repair deficiency (HRD) with the clinical activity of the combination of cediranib and olaparib or olaparib monotherapy, as measured by rPFS, in mCRPC patients.\n\nIII. To evaluate the safety the combination of cediranib and olaparib and olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To characterize genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing in mCRPC patients and correlate that with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nII. To characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes, angiogenesis markers, and immune markers, by whole transcriptome sequencing and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIII. To characterize changes in immune tumor microenvironment in mCRPC patients by profiling expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIV. To identify baseline predictive biomarkers for rPFS or response and to identify on-treatment markers of acquired resistance in men with mCRPC receiving either olaparib plus cediranib or olaparib alone.\n\nV. To explore biomarker signatures that correlate with the clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib, including changes in gene expression or acquired mutations in tumor biopsies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28.

We investigated whether cediranib combined with olaparib improves the clinical outcomes of patients with prostate cancer. Methods: Patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were randomly assigned 1:1 to arm A: cediranib 30 mg once daily plus olaparib 200 mg twice daily or arm B: olaparib 300 mg twice daily alone. The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in the intention-to-treat patients. The secondary end points were rPFS in patients with HRR-deficient and HRR-proficient mCRPC. Results: In the intention-to-treat set of 90 patients, median rPFS was 8.5 (95% CI, 5.4 to 12.0) and 4.0 (95% CI, 3.2 to 8.5) months in arms A and B, respectively. Cediranib/olaparib significantly improved rPFS versus olaparib alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.617; 95% CI, 0.392 to 0.969; P = .0359). Descriptive analyses showed a median rPFS of 10.6 (95% CI, 5.9 to not assessed [NA]) and 3.8 (95% CI, 2.33 to NA) months (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.272 to 1.504) among patients with HRR-deficient mCRPC, and 13.8 (95% CI, 3.3 to NA) and 11.3 (95% CI, 3.8 to NA) months (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.321 to 2.988) among patients with BRCA2 -mutated mCRPC in arms A and B, respectively. The incidence of grades 3-4 adverse events was 61% and 18% in arms A and B, respectively. Conclusion: Cediranib combined with olaparib improved rPFS compared with olaparib alone in men with mCRPC. This combination was associated with an increased incidence of grades 3-4 adverse events. BRCA2 -mutated subgroups treated with olaparib with or without cediranib were associated with a numerically longer median rPFS. Trial registration: ClinicalTrial...",

Article Author(s): In Partnership With: The combination of cediranib and olaparib significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival compared with olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Joseph W. Kim, MD The combination of cediranib and olaparib (Lynparza) significantly improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) compared with olaparib monotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), according to findings from a phase 2 trial (NCT02893917), which were published in theJournal of Clinical Oncology.1However, the combination was also associated with an increased rate of adverse effects (AEs). At a data cutoff of October 1, 2020, and a median follow-up of 26.1 months, of the 90 patients in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the median rPFS was 8.47 months (95% CI, 5.37-12.00) in patients who received the combination vs 3.97 months (95% CI, 3.23-8.47) in patients who received olaparib alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.617; 95% CI, 0.392-0.969;P= .0359). “Our randomized study evaluated whether combining an antiangiogenic agent, cediranib, with olaparib can improve the outcomes of patients with mCRPC,” lead study author, Joseph W. Kim, MD, of Yale School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center in New Haven, Connecticut, and colleagues, wrote. PARP inhibition is a standard treatment option for patients with mCRPC with deleterious homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene mutations. Preclinical studies in prostate, breast, and lung cancer cell lines have shown that a hypotoxic tumor microenvironment downregulates HRR gene expression, thereby increasing PARP inhibition sensitivity. Olaparib has previously demonstrated improvements in rPFS and overall survival (OS) compared with abiraterone acetate (Zytiga) or enzalutamide (Xtandi). Cediranib, a pan-vascular EGFR inhibitor, has been shown in preclinical models to suppress HRR gene...",

We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of first-line [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE ( 177 Lu-Dotatate) treatment. Methods: NETTER-2 was an open-label, randomised, parallel-group, superiority, phase 3 trial. We enrolled patients (aged ≥15 years) with newly diagnosed higher grade 2 (Ki67 ≥10% and ≤20%) and grade 3 (Ki67 >20% and ≤55%), somatostatin receptor-positive (in all target lesions), advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours from 45 centres across nine countries in North America, Europe, and Asia. We used interactive response technologies to randomly assign (2:1) patients to receive four cycles (cycle interval was 8 weeks ± 1 week) of intravenous 177 Lu-Dotatate plus intramuscular octreotide 30 mg long-acting repeatable (LAR) then octreotide 30 mg LAR every 4 weeks ( 177 Lu-Dotatate group) or high-dose octreotide 60 mg LAR every 4 weeks (control group), stratified by neuroendocrine tumour grade (2 vs 3) and origin (pancreas vs other). Tumour assessments were done at baseline, week 16, and week 24, and then every 12 weeks until disease progression or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival by blinded, independent, central radiology assessment. We did the primary analysis at 101 progression-free survival events as the final progression-free survival analysis. NETTER-2 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03972488 , and is active and not recruiting. Findings: Between Jan 22, 2020, and Oct 13, 2022, we screened 261 patients, 35 (13%) of whom were excluded.

The treatment of these tumours in an advanced setting is based on relatively little robust data. Recent findings: A recent pathological classification introduced a new category of high-grade but well differentiated neuroendocrine tumours (NET G3), with markedly different behaviour from neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs). Yet, the optimal treatment of those tumours is still uncertain. Advances are needed in molecular subtyping of NENs to understand better their heterogeneity and inform personalized therapies. Summary: The current review summarizes the current knowledge, indicates some exciting future directions and outlines the most interesting ongoing clinical trials likely to impact current practice.

News Article Author(s): Fact checked by: Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate shows consistent efficacy over high-dose octreotide in advanced GEP-NETs, according to data from the NETTER-2 trial. Marianne E. Pavel, MD Efficacy benefits provided by lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (177Lu-Dotatate; Lutathera) over high-dose octreotide as first-line treatment in patients with advanced, well-differentiated, grade 2 or 3 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) proved to be consistent after adjustment for baseline covariates, according to data from a post-hoc, multivariate analysis of the phase 3 NETTER-2 trial (NCT03972488) presented during the2024 ESMO Congress.1 The key objectives of the analysis were to examine the effect of the therapy when adjusted for baseline covariates, including disease spread, and to determine potential prognostic factors, Marianne E. Pavel, MD, of the Department of Medicine 1, Uniklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nümberg, in Erlangen, Germany, said in an oral presentation of the data. Pavel and colleagues applied a multivariate Cox regression model for progression-free survival (PFS) and a logistic regression model for overall response rate (ORR) to select baseline covariates of age (<65 vs ≥65 years), sex (male vs female), primary disease site (pancreas vs small intestine vs other), NET grade (G2 vs G3 low [Ki67 ≤30%] vs G3 high [Ki67 >30%]), Ki67 as a continuous variable, metastatic spread (liver metastases only with or without lymph nodes vs other metastases), chromogranin A (CgA; ≤2 x upper limit of normal [ULN] vs >2 x ULN), somatostatin receptor (SSTR) uptake score (3 [>liver, <spleen] vs 4 [>spleen]). When adjusted for covariates, they found that effects on PFS and ORR were minimally affected. With regard to PFS, the hazard ratio (HR) for PFS in the primary analysis with 177Lu-Dotatate vs high-dose octreotide was 0.276 (95% CI, 0.182-0.418;P< .0001). In the exploratory a...",

News Article Author(s): First-line treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate plus long-acting octreotide led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival compared with high-dose long-acting octreotide alone in newly diagnosed patients with somatostatin receptor–positive, grade 2 and 3, advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. First-line treatment with lutetium Lu 177 dotatate (Lutathera; lutetium [177Lu] oxodotreotide) plus long-acting octreotide led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in progression-free survival compared with high-dose long-acting octreotide alone in newly diagnosed patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR)–positive, grade 2 and 3, advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), meeting the primary end point of the phase 3 NETTER-2 trial (NCT03972488).1 A key secondary end point of objective response rate (ORR) was also met. Regarding safety, findings were consistent with the known toxicity profile of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate, and no new or unexpected safety signals were reported. Detailed findings from NETTER-2 will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and shared with health authorities. “These positive results for [lutetium Lu 177 dotatate] are quite remarkable and they represent the potential for radioligand therapy to make a meaningful impact for newly diagnosed patients living with advanced GEP-NETs,” Jeff Legos, executive vice president and global head of Oncology Development at Novartis, stated in a news release. “Exploring the use of radioligand therapies in earlier lines of treatment for patients with cancer is part of our larger, collaborative effort to precisely deliver novel treatment modalities directly to the cancer cells to improve patient outcomes.” In January 2018,the FDA approved lutetium Lu 177 dotatatefor the treatment of patients with SSTR-positive GEP-NETs.2...",

Eligible patients are to be consented and can then continue treatment with pasireotide alone or in combination with another treatment for Cushing's Disease and Acromegaly in this protocol. All patients at their scheduled visits will have drug dispensing information and reported adverse events and serious adverse events collected.\n\nA patient will reach the end of study when pasireotide treatment is permanently discontinued and the end of treatment visit has been performed. All patients must be followed up for safety evaluations for 3 months following the last dose of pasireotide LAR treatment and for 1 month following the last dose of pasireotide s.c. treatment.\n\nThe study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years or until such time that enrolled patients no longer need treatment with pasireotide or are able to obtain commercial supply according to local regulations for their medical condition.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient is currently participating in a Novartis-sponsored study receiving pasireotide (LAR and/or s.c.) on monotherapy or combination therapy (for Cushing's Disease or Acromegaly), and has fulfilled all required assessments in the parent study and patients that are benefiting from the study treatment have no other alternatives.\n2. Patient is currently benefiting from the treatment with pasireotide, as determined by the investigator\n3. Patient has demonstrated compliance, as assessed by the investigator, with the parent study requirements.\n4. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other study procedures.\n5. Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in roll-over study and receiving study medication.\n\n   * If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient has been permanently discontinued from pasireotide study treatment in the parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance to study procedures, withdrawal of consent or any other reason.\n2. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.\n3. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 30 days after the final dose of pasireotide s.c. and 84 days after the final dose of pasireotide LAR. Highly effective contraception is defined as either:\n\n   * Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n   * Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n   * Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to enrolling). For female patients on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n   * Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate \\<1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\n   * In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.\n   * Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.\n   * Sexually active males, unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 1 months after pasireotide s.c. last dose and 3 months after pasireotide LAR last dose, should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.",

Results from preclinical studies indicate that pasireotide can inhibit neuroendocrine tumor (NET) growth more robustly than octreotide in vitro. This open-label, phase II study assessed the clinical activity of pasireotide in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic grade 1 or 2 NETs. Patients with metastatic pancreatic and extra-pancreatic NETs were treated with pasireotide LAR (60 mg every 4 weeks). Previous systemic therapy, including octreotide and lanreotide, was not permitted. Tumor assessments were performed every 3 months using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), overall radiographic response rate (ORR), and safety. Twenty-nine patients were treated with pasireotide LAR (60 mg every 4 weeks) and 28 were evaluable for response. The median PFS was 11 months. The most favorable effect was observed in patients with low hepatic tumor burden, normal baseline chromogranin A, and high tumoral SSTR5 expression. Median OS has not been reached; the 30-month OS rate was 70%. The best radiographic response was partial response in one patient (4%), stable disease in 17 patients (60%), and progressive disease in ten patients (36%). Although grade 3/4 toxicities were rare, pasireotide LAR treatment was associated with a 79% rate of hyperglycemia including 14% grade 3 hyperglycemia. Although pasireotide appears to be an effective antiproliferative agent in the treatment of advanced NETs, the high incidence of hyperglycemia raises concerns regarding its suitability as a first-line systemic agent in unselected patients. SSTR5 expression is a potentially predictive biomarker for ...",

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of long-acting pasireotide and everolimus, administered alone or in combination, in patients with advanced carcinoids of the lung or thymus. Methods: LUNA was a prospective, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial of adult patients (aged >18 years) with advanced (unresectable or metastatic), well differentiated carcinoid tumours of the lung or thymus, with radiological progression within 12 months before randomisation, and a WHO performance status of 0-2. At each centre, the investigator or their designee registered each patient using an interactive voice recognition system into one of the three treatment groups. The randomisation allocation sequence was generated by an external company; patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive treatment with long-acting pasireotide (60 mg intramuscularly every 28 days), everolimus (10 mg orally once daily), or both in combination, for the core 12-month treatment period. Patients were stratified by carcinoid type (typical vs atypical) and line of study treatment (first line vs others). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients progression-free at month 9, defined as the proportion of patients with overall lesion assessment at month 9 showing a complete response, partial response, or stable disease according to local Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01563354 . The extension phase of the study is ongoing.

The study will enroll at least 8 patients in the GEP-NET cohort and as many adolescents with PPGL as possible in the exploratory PPGL cohort.",
      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consists of the screening period (up to 2 weeks) followed by the treatment period (4 treatment administrations at 8-week interval), and the follow-up period (10 years).\n\nThe treatment period will consist of 4 Lutathera treatments administered at 8-week intervals. Lutathera administration will occur on Week 1 Day 1 of each cycle. Each patient will receive a total of 4 doses of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi). An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with each Lutathera dose for renal protection according to the approved Lutathera local prescribing information. An antiemetic will be administered prior to infusion of the AA solution for prevention of infusion-related nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe dosimetry and PK assessments will be performed during the first week after the 1st Lutathera dose, i.e. one time during the study treatment period for each patient. The dosimetry analysis will allow for estimation from the 1st Lutathera administration of the cumulative absorbed radiation dose from 4 Lutathera doses and also for taking a decision on the next dose levels. In the exceptional circumstances when dosimetry cannot be performed in a particular patient after the first Lutathera dose, it should be completed as soon as feasible upon a later dose. In order to minimize risk for each study subject, an accelerated analysis of dosimetry and safety data will be performed for each patient in the study, to enable the Investigator to take a decision for the subsequent Lutathera doses. The results of dosimetry assessments (imaging and blood dosimetry) will be provided to the investigators for their evaluation prior to administration of subsequent therapeutic cycles in each patient.\n\nA total follow-up period of 10 years (120 months) after the last Lutathera dose will take place for each patient who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This follow-up period will be comprised of a short-term follow-up of 6 months to evaluate cumulative Lutathera toxicities, followed by a long-term follow up of another 114 months.\n\nAn external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also operate in the study to evaluate accumulating safety and dosimetry data, to ensure the safety of adolescents enrolled in the study, and to provide recommendations to investigators as well as to the clinical team in charge of conducting the study.",

Abstract Purpose: NETTER-P, an open-label Phase II study, evaluated the safety and dosimetry of [ 177 Lu]Lu-DOTA-TATE (hereafter 177 Lu-DOTATATE) in adolescents with advanced, somatostatin receptor-positive, well-differentiated, Grade 1/2 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET) or pheochromocytoma and paragangliomas (PPGL). Methods: Patients (12-17 years old) received four cycles of 177 Lu-DOTATATE (7.4 GBq every 8 ± 1 weeks; cumulative administered activity: 29.6 GBq). Primary endpoints were absorbed dose (kidneys and bone marrow) and safety after first administration. Safety during treatment and comparative assessments of dosimetry and pharmacokinetics between adolescents and historical adult patients were evaluated. Results: Eleven patients (4 GEP-NET, 7 PPGL; median age 15 [range, 13-17] years) were enrolled and received ≥ 1 administration of 177 Lu-DOTATATE. Median (range) cumulative administered activity was 28.2 (7.3-29.9) GBq.

On April 23, 2024, the FDAapproved lutetium Lu 177 dotatatefor the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with SSTR-positive GEP-NETs, including foregut, midgut, and hindgut NETs. This regulatory decision was supported by safety findings from the phase 2 NETTER-P trial (NCT04711135), as well as safety and efficacy data from the phase 3 NETTER-1 trial (NCT01578239). In 2018, lutetium Lu 177 dotatatereceived FDA approval forthe treatment ofadult patientswith SSTR-positive GEP-NETs based on data from NETTER-1. NETTER-P showed that the adverse effect (AE) profile of the radiopharmaceutical in 9 pediatric patients, including 4 with GEP-NETs, was similar to that observed in adult patients. The main outcomes of NETTER-P included absorbed radiation doses in target organs and the incidence of AEs after the first treatment cycle. Secondary outcomes included short-term AEs following treatment with the radiopharmaceutical. The recommended dose of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate is 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) every 8 weeks (± 1 week) for 4 total doses. Since pediatric NETs are rare tumors, a dearth of research exists surrounding optimal therapies for these patients, Halperin says. The past several years have seen many research and treatment advances for adult patients with NETs, prompting oncologists who treat pediatric patients with NETs to wonder whether those therapies are applicable in...",

Nitya Raj, MD, clinical director, Gastrointestinal Oncology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, discusses the results of a phase 4 trial (NCT03289741) comparing injection site pain with octreotide long-acting release (LAR) vs lanreotide in well-differentiatedneuroendocrine tumors (NETs). The results of this randomized, blinded trial, which were presented during the 2021 NANETS Symposium, did not demonstrate a significant difference in the patient experience regarding comfort and pain with the injection with octreotide LAR vs lanreotide, Raj says. Among patients who received octreotide LAR first, the mean injection site pain score was 2.4 compared with 1.9 in patients who received lanreotide first, Raj explains. The difference in these pain scores was not statistically significant, Raj continues. Moreover, it is important to recognize that out of a 10-point scale, the pain experience by patients was relatively low overall, Raj concludes.

Approved rapalogs such as everolimus inhibit mTORC1 and have limited clinical activity, possibly due to compensatory feedback loops. Sapanisertib addresses the potential for incomplete inhibition of the mTOR pathway through targeting of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, and thus to reverse resistance to earlier rapamycin analogues. In stage 1, patients received sapanisertib 3 mg by mouth once daily on a continuous dosing schedule in 28-day cycle. This trial adopted a two-stage design with the primary objective of evaluating objective tumor response. The first stage would recruit 13 patients in order to accrue 12 eligible and treated patients. If among the 12 eligible patients at least 1 patient had an objective response to therapy, the study would move to the second stage of accrual where 25 eligible and treated patients would be enrolled. This study activated on February 1, 2017, the required pre-determined number of patients (n = 13) had entered by November 5, 2018 for the first stage response evaluation. The accrual of this trial was formally terminated on December 27, 2019 as no response had been observed after the first stage accrual. Treatment-related grade 3 adverse events were reported in eight (61%) patients with hyperglycemia being the most frequent, in three patients (23%). Other toxicities noted in the trial included fatigue, rash diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The median PFS was 5.19 months (95% CI [3.84, 9.30]) and the median OS was 20.44 months (95% CI [5.65, 22.54]). Due to the lack of responses in Stage 1 of the study, the study did not proceed to stage 2. Thus the potential to reverse resistance was not evident. Keywords: PNET; Sapanisertib; mTORC1/2 ...",

The addition of immune checkpoint inhibition to platinum-based chemotherapy may improve survival. NICE-NEC ( NCT03980925 ) is a single-arm, phase II trial that recruited chemotherapy-naive, unresectable advanced or metastatic G3 NENs of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) or unknown origin. Patients received nivolumab 360 mg intravenously (iv) on day 1, carboplatin AUC 5 iv on day 1, and etoposide 100 mg/m 2 /d iv on days 1-3, every 3 weeks for up to six cycles, followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for up to 24 months, disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the 12-month overall survival (OS) rate (H 0 50%, H 1 72%, β 80%, α 5%). Secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety. From 2019 to 2021, 37 patients were enrolled. The most common primary sites were the pancreas (37.8%), stomach (16.2%) and colon (10.8%). Twenty-five patients (67.6%) were poorly differentiated carcinomas (NECs) and/or had a Ki67 index >55%. The ORR was 56.8%. Median PFS was 5.7 months (95%CI: 5.1-9) and median OS 13.9 months (95%CI: 8.3-Not reached), with a 12-month OS rate of 54.1% (95%CI: 40.2-72.8) that did not meet the primary endpoint. However, 37.6% of patients were long-term survivors (>2 years). The safety profile was consistent with previous reports. There was one treatment-related death. Nivolumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with prolonged survival in over one-third of chemonaïve patients with G3 GEP-NENs, with a manageable safety profile. © 2024. The Author(s).

      "detailed_description": "STZ plus 5-Fuorouracil (5FU) is the actual standard of care for advanced pancreatic Neuroendocrine tumours (pNETS) in the European Union. Everolimus has been recently approved for its use in advanced pNETs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in Europe by the European Medical Agency (EMA).\n\nA randomized study is needed to have a clear knowledge about the best sequence for its administration; this is, before or after palliative chemotherapy.\n\nThere may or may not be any benefits from giving first each other treatment of the study. The information obtained from this study will help the physician improve the treatment and management of patients with advanced pNET.\n\nThis study was planned to compare STZ-5FU chemotherapy followed by everolimus upon progression versus the reverse sequence. However sequential studies with pNETs are hard to be managed in terms of time and costs. Therefore the protocol was amended to have PFS1 (progression free survival after course 1) as primary endpoint and PFS2 (i.e. progression free survival after both STZ based chemotherapy and Everolimus or the reverse order) as secondary endpoint. This information will be extremely valuable for the day to day clinical practice of pNETs oncologists",

News Article Author(s): Fact checked by: The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to GSK5764227 for the treatment of relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma. FDA The FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to the B7-H3–targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) GSK5764227 (GSK’227; HS-20093) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma whose disease has progressed on at least two prior lines of therapy.1 The designation was supported by findings from the phase 2 ARTEMIS-002 trial (NCT04502044), which was an open-label, randomized, multicenter study that investigated the efficacy and safety of GSK’227 in patients with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma and other unresectable bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Data from the phase 2 ARTEMIS-002 trial presented at the2024 ASCO Annual Meetingdemonstrated that at a median follow-up of 3.3 months, all evaluable patients with relapsed/refractory osteosarcoma (n = 38) experienced an overall response rate (ORR) of 10.5% (95% CI, 2.9%-21.1%) and a disease control rate (DCR) of 78.9% (95% CI, 62.7%-90.4%).2In those treated with the 12.0-mg/kg dose of HS-20093 (n = 23), the ORR was 17.4% (95% CI, 5.0%-38.8%), and the DCR was 87.0% (95% CI, 66.4%-97.2%). In patients treated with GSK’227 at 8.0 mg/kg (n = 15), the ORR and DCR were 0% (95% CI, 0%-21.8%) and 66.7% (95% CI, 38.4%-88.2%), respectively. “This latest regulatory designation for GSK’227 exemplifies the potential of our targeted ADC in patients with difficult-to-treat cancers. For patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, there is an urgent unmet medical need with no approved treatment options once the cancer returns a second time, and chemotherapy provides limited benefit in this setting,” Hesham Abdullah, senior vice president, global head oncology, R&D, at GSK, stated in a news release.1 The open-label, 2-arm ARTEMIS-002 trial enrolled patients at least 18 years of age with histo...",
