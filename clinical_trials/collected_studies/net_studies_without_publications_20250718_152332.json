      "brief_summary": "Despite the low androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer, there is persistent AR expression observed in the majority of treatment-emergent small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-SCNC) biopsies. This indicates that epigenetic dysregulation leads to reprogramming away from an AR-driven transcriptional program. Therefore, continuation of AR blockade in the form of apalutamide may provide additive benefit compared to immune checkpoint blockade alone. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of apalutamide plus cetrelimab will achieve a clinically significant composite response rate with sufficient durability of response in mCRPC patients with evidence of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer",

The use of the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine (FluzoneÂ®) is allowed.\n* Pregnant or lactating females are excluded from this study because cabozantinib and nivolumab are agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with cabozantinib and nivolumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with cabozantinib and nivolumab.

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well antiandrogen therapy, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone with or without neutron radiation therapy work in treating patients with prostate cancer. Hormone therapy such as antiandrogen therapy may fight prostate cancer by blocking the production and interfering with the action of hormones. Abiraterone acetate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Neutron radiation therapy uses high energy neutrons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. It is not yet known whether antiandrogen therapy, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone with or without neutron radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer.",

The only FDA approved treatment regimen offers little response potential. In currently unpublished data with inhibitory immune checkpoint agents, patients with NET have shown promising clinical benefit. This therapy offers a novel approach to potentially provide long term benefit, but must be further explored. The safety profile of nivolumab plus ipilimumab is characterized by immune-related toxicities, such as diarrhea, rash, pneumonitis, liver toxicity, and endocrinopathies (Nivolumab, Ipilimumab Investigator's Brochures). The frequencies and intensities of these events in the combination are variable and depend on the specific doses and schedule used. In the dosing schedules selected, these events were mostly low grade and manageable with the use of corticosteroids. Nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy has shown improved efficacy over either agent alone in melanoma. Rationale for Single Arm Design This study will use a single arm open-label design.

In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that proteasome inhibitors have activity against a variety of tumor types. Carfilzomib (KyprolisÂ®) is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor with a favorable safety profile that has been studied in a variety of hematologic and solid tumors. Carfilzomib received accelerated approval from the U.S. FDA in 2012, based on a favorable response rate, for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who received at least two prior therapies, and demonstrated disease progression within 60 days of completing the last therapy. In this multi-center study, the investigators propose to evaluate carfilzomib for the treatment of patients with advanced neuroendocrine cancers.",
