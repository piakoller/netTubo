Erdafitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving erdafitinib may help control disease in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition, studying samples of blood, tissue, plasma, and bone marrow from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about changes that occur in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and identify biomarkers related to cancer.",

If the hypothesis is finally proved, it will help doctors and molecular biologists to choose the best drug (or combination of drugs) based on the individual oncogenomics of each patient.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a prospective, open label, real-world study to evaluate the feasibility of matched molecular targeted therapy in patients with refractory gastrointestinal cancer based on tumor molecular characteristics as standard treatment failure. This is a non-randomized trial designed to test molecular matching strategies based on patient genome information. The molecular tumor board (MTB) will recommend treatment, but the treatment decision is up to the attending physician. FoundationOne CDx was used for tissue genomic analysis. If possible, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor mutation load (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) status will also be evaluated. Based on this information, MTB, composed of multidisciplinary experts, will focus on the selection of customized, best matched drugs or combinations to target most of the genomic changes in each patient, also taking into account potential drug toxicity. The final treatment will be based on the choice of oncologists, who will formulate treatment plan by combining MTB discussion, patient preference, attention to complications, consideration of drug toxicity, insurance coverage of off label drugs and availability of clinical trials of research drugs, thus reflecting the actual clinical practice nowadays in China. The acquisition of drugs follows the actual situation in the real world and is not within the scope of this study design.\n\nThe principles of MTB treatment recommendations can be referred to the NCI-MATCH trial:\n\nGrade 1: FDA / NMPA approval; clear evidence and mechanism; concomitant diagnostic relationship between drug and target.\n\nGrade 2: The drug reaches the clinical end point (objective response rate, PFS or OS); there is evidence of target inhibition; there is strong evidence to predict relationship between the target and the drug.\n\nGrade 3: The drug has evidence of clinical activity and target inhibition; there is some evidence to predict the relationship between target and drug.\n\nGrade 4: Pre-clinical evidence of anti-tumor activity and evidence of target inhibition; there is hypothesis to predict the relationship between target and drug.\n\nPatients who meet the inclusion criteria and sign informed consent will be analyzed for tumor mutation by FoundationOne CDx detection. Biopsy specimens of metastatic foci can be selected for gene detection. If there is no targeted therapy among patients, the archived diagnostic tumor samples can also be used for detection. If the patient has received targeted therapy, the investigators will try to obtain biopsy samples after treatment. If the sample cannot be tested or the test results are not satisfactory, additional slices need to be sent to the laboratory. If the repeated test fails, repeat biopsy if the clinical conditions permit, or patients should be included in the unmatched treatment group.\n\nDetermining the interventability of gene mutations depends on genomic changes, allele frequency, and diagnosis. This study will combine the recommendations of MTB and gene testing reports to determine the interventability of mutated genes.\n\nInterventional mutation: cancers have FDA or NMPA approved therapies, or there are matching drugs in clinical trials.\n\nNon-interventional mutation: there is no FDA or NMPA approved treatment for cancers, and no matching drug is available in clinical trials.\n\nMTB should at least be composed of attending doctors, molecular pathology experts and bioinformatics experts. The research center is responsible for the establishment and holding of MTB. As management of patients enrolled in this study is essential, the research committee, including but not limited to the main investigator of the study and the treated medical oncologist, can provide advice as needed between MTB meetings to avoid treatment delays. By analyzing the genomic variation of patients, independent MTB recommends molecular targeted therapy that can inhibit the mutation directly or through related pathways or be included in relevant clinical trials. The independent research committee will use the \"N-to-1\" model of precision medicine to propose a matching therapy consisting of at least one drug that targets molecular changes. The investigators expect 50-70% of patients to carry intervening variants, and that proportion is rising rapidly as learning more about these pathways and drugs. The investigators expect that about 40% of patients with intervening variants will be able to receive molecular targeted \"matching\" therapy.",

Participants will complete four online or paper surveys over 18 months; these surveys will focus on patient-reported outcomes, including questions on quality of life, treatment decisions, and experiences with cancer care. Survey data will be linked to participant medical record data to achieve study aims.",
      "detailed_description": "NETs are a group of neoplasms that occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and the lungs, collectively referred to as gastroenteropancreatic (GEP-NETs) and lung-NETs. There are currently fewer than 180,000 patients living with this condition in the United States, meeting the criteria for rare disease status. NETs are typically slow growing, with vague signs and a myriad of symptoms (carcinoid syndrome) leading to diagnostic delays. Thus, NET patients typically experience a prolonged clinical course with active disease, and many have significant symptom burdens. However, assessment of quality of life outside of therapy trials remains scarce and of poor quality. What's more, over half of GEP-NETs are diagnosed with spread of their disease at diagnosis and are not candidates for curative surgery. Fortunately, many of these tumors are amenable to long-term medical treatment with somatostatin analogues (SSAs)- which slow down the production of hormones, especially serotonin, which helps to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. However, living with distant spread of the disease increases the probability for the disease to progress. Following failure of first-line SSA therapy there are no clear consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of other therapeutic options. NET patients are left wondering not only 'what therapy would be best to try next?', but 'if I were to take this option now, what treatment options will be closed off to me in the future?' and clinicians are unsure as to how best to tailor treatment selection on the characteristics of the patient and their tumor.\n\nThere is currently no large nationally recruiting prospective (forward in time) observational study of NET patients. Our large study will robustly generate real-world evidence on the frequency and sequence of commonly used treatments for GEP and lung NET patients in relation to Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and survival/progression, endpoints that matter most to NET patients, their caregivers, and clinicians involved in their care. Given the lack of consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of treatments, evidence generated in this study will aid patient (and clinician) navigation and selection of the next most appropriate therapy, accounting for the preferences and needs of the individual patient, whilst respecting the underlying profile of their tumor. Moreover, the infrastructure this study will generate (i.e.: electronic identification of NET patients, entry and completion of tumor table data in PCORnet, and a unique NET patient health record portal), will foster future CER studies in NETs and other rare diseases.\n\nThe four specific aims of this project are:\n\n1. To describe the frequency of treatment regimens received by line of therapy, and examine their association with symptom burden and changes in 6, 12 and 18 month health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes. The influence of patient preferences, beliefs, attitudes, and experience of care on choice of these treatment regimens will also be examined.\n2. To examine the association of patient, clinical, and tumor characteristics on the selection of first-line and beyond treatment regimens and compare the effects of common treatment sequences on frequency of subsequent treatments received and outcomes of overall survival and disease progression.\n3. To compare the effectiveness of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) regimens on outcomes of renal toxicity, disease progression, and patient-reported symptoms and HRQoL.\n4. To disseminate lessons learned and expand enrollment of the prospective cohort to patient advocate organizations, and to use the infrastructure developed to aid in the study of other rare diseases.",

      "brief_summary": "The four tumour streams that will be studied in this protocol are based on immunotherapy sensitive rare cancers from CA209-538 which will be further investigated under this protocol and divided into four groups:\n\n1. Neuroendocrine cancers: Atypical bronchial carcinoid, neuroendocrine carcinoma and Grade 3 NETs independent of primary site (SCLC excluded)\n2. Biliary tract cancers: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma\n3. Gynaecological malignancies: Ovarian clear cell carcinoma, uterine clear cell carcinoma, uterine/ovarian carcinosarcoma, uterine leiomyosarcoma and vaginal/vulva squamous cell carcinoma\n4. Mismatch repair protein deficient (MSI-H) cancers (excluding colorectal carcinoma).\n\nThe role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.\n\nThis protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of nivolumab \\& ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 2 clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in immunotherapy sensitive rare cancers. This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) \\>6 months and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, patients are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. CA209-538 examined this treatment combination in three 'baskets' of rare cancers: rare upper gastrointestinal, gynaecological and neuroendocrine cancers. The cancers on study all individually had an incidence of \\<2/100000/year. The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of rare cancer patients. Given the success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a range of different cancer types, it was postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. CA209-538 enrolled 120 rare cancer patients on study, clinical benefit rate was \\>30% across all baskets, long term survival follow-up is underway.\n\nThis study will enrol 240 participants, across 4 cohorts with histotypes which demonstrated clinical benefit on CA209-538. All participants will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy.",

Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) must inform the treating physician immediately\n* Patients must be able to swallow tablets\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document. Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be eligible\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients must not require systemic corticosteroids treatment (\\>= 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 28 days prior to study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses \\< 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids in patients with adrenal insufficiency are permitted, even if \\>= 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted, as is steroid pre-medication for contrast allergy\n* Patients must not have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways\n* Patients must not have had prior treatment with XL184 (cabozantinib), or any MET-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), or any MET-targeting monoclonal antibody (MetMAb), such as onartuzumab\n* Patients must not have received radiation therapy to any part of the body within 28 days\n* Patients must not have clinically relevant, ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy. No radiation therapy is allowed while the patient is on study. Palliative radiation therapy, if needed, should be completed at least 28 days prior to enrollment into the study as described above\n* Patients must not require concomitant treatment with oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, direct thrombin, and factor Xa inhibitors) or platelet inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel). The following anticoagulants are allowed:\n\n  * Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (per local applicable guidelines),\n  * Low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH),\n  * Therapeutic doses of LMWH are allowed in patients without known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of LMWH for at least 6 weeks before the first dose of study treatment, and who have had no clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor\n* Patients must not have had major surgery (e.g., gastrointestinal \\[GI\\] surgery or removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Complete wound healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month before the first dose of study treatment and from minor surgery (e.g., simple excision or tooth extraction) at least 10 days before the first dose. Patients with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible\n* Patients must not have received cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy) or biologic agents (e.g., cytokines or antibodies) within 4 weeks, or nitrosoureas/ mitomycin C within 4 weeks, before the first dose of study treatment. Patients may continue on bone-modifying agents (denosumab or bisphosphonates) with caution\n* Patients who have not recovered to baseline from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)0.5 unless the adverse events (AEs) are clinically nonsignificant and/or stable on supportive therapy, with the exception of alopecia\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Patients must not have received any other type of investigational agent within 4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment to be eligible\n* Patients must not have a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) \\> 500 msec by electrocardiogram (EKG) within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment\n\n  * Note: If a single EKG shows a QTcF with an absolute value \\> 500 msec, two additional EKGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the initial EKG, and the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility\n* Patients should not have known, untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases because of poor prognosis and concerns that progressive neurologic dysfunction could confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to agents used in study\n* Patients must not have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any monoclonal antibodies\n* Patients must not require concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, or St. John's wort). Because lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, patients will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients must not have uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n  * Cardiovascular disorders:\n\n    * Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 3 or 4, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n    * Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) \\> 140 mm Hg systolic or \\> 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within seven days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n    * Stroke (including transient ischemic attack \\[TIA\\]), myocardial infarction (MI), or other ischemic event, or thromboembolic event (e.g., deep venous thrombosis \\[DVT\\], pulmonary embolism \\[PE\\]) within 6 months before first dose.\n  * GI disorders including those associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula formation:\n\n    * The patient has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, acute obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric outlet obstruction.\n    * Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months before first dose. Complete healing of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed before first dose.\n  * Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis or other history of significant bleeding (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first dose.\n  * Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endotracheal or endobronchial disease manifestation.\n  * Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels.\n  * Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study participation.\n\n    * Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture.\n    * Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism.\n    * Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because XL184 (cabozantinib) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects, and the effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the developing fetus are not well known. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, or ipilimumab\n* Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including high dose systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not limited to: immune-related neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, or autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus (DM), or endocrine deficiencies (e.g., thyroiditis) managed with replacement hormones, including physiologic corticosteroids, are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication, and patients with positive serology, (e.g., antinuclear antibodies \\[ANA\\] or anti-thyroid antibodies) should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well temozolomide and capecitabine work compared to standard treatment with cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract or pancreas that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, capecitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Certain types of neuroendocrine carcinomas may respond better to treatments other than the current standard treatment of cisplatin and etoposide. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and capecitabine may work better than cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with this type of neuroendocrine carcinoma, called non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.",

To assess the progression free survival (PFS) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the PFS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the response rate (RR) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the RR of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nII. To assess the overall survival (OS) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the OS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nIII. To evaluate the toxicities associated with the combination of temozolomide and capecitabine and the combination of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide, respectively, in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the impact of each treatment regimen on PFS, RR and OS based on marker of proliferation Ki-67 index in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. (Laboratory) II. To assess the prognostic significance of well differentiated versus poorly differentiated non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in relationship to survival and response to treatment. (Laboratory) III. To assess the agreement in Ki-67 status between that reported by institutional pathologist and that reported by central pathology review. (Laboratory)\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 10-14. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nARM B: Patients receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) on days 1-3 or carboplatin IV on day 1. Patients also receive etoposide IV on days 1-3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.",

      "detailed_description": "This research study is designed to explore if a new radiotherapeutic (radioactive) drug, named 212Pb (212-lead) VMT-α-NET, works against neuroendocrine tumor cells. To begin researching this drug, we need to determine if \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET is safe and tolerable when used as a cancer treatment. As a safety study, it is unknown if the treatment is safe or effective.\n\nThe study will also estimate the radiation dose to the kidneys for this treatment. To calculate this radiation dose, imaging is also performed with the sister drug, \\[203Pb\\] VMT-α-NET using SPECT/CT imaging. Each participant is assigned a radiation dose to the kidneys that cannot be exceeded. The study is testing the safety of the specific radiation dose to the kidneys when using \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET.\n\nParticipants are assigned a radiation dose based on how other participants have tolerated the \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET. The amount of \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET administered varies person-to-person because of each person's unique tumor uptake of \\[203Pb\\] VMT-α-NET and how long it lasts in the body.\n\nThe study involves 2 treatments, about 8 to 10 weeks apart. The drug is given by infusion once per treatment. The participants also receive an infusion of amino acids to help protect the kidneys as well as medications to help protect against nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).\n\nOnce a participant is administered the \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET, they must be followed (i.e. come back to the clinic) for at least 6 months for safety assessments. Safety assessments include blood tests to check bone marrow, kidney, and liver function as well as urinary tests to check kidney function. Participants will also have imaging at 6 months post-treatment to measure how their tumors responded to therapy.\n\nParticipants will have lifelong follow-up for this study.",

      "brief_summary": "This pilot phase II trial studies how effective pembrolizumab and liver-directed therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are at treating patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or progressive tumors that have spread to the liver (liver metastases). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Liver-directed therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial embolization, yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization, and cryoablation may help activate the immune system in order to shrink tumors that are not being directly targeted. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is a form of targeted treatment that is performed by the use of a small molecule, which carries a radioactive component attached to a peptide. Once injected into the body, this small molecule binds to some specific sites on tumor cells called receptors and emit medium energy radiation that can destroy cells. Because this radionuclide is attached to the peptide, which binds receptors on tumor lesions, the radiation can preferably be targeted to the tumor cells in order to destroy them. Giving pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy may work better than pembrolizumab alone.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), transarterial embolization, and radioembolization.\n\nII. To evaluate the best observed overall response rate (ORR) in lesion(s) not targeted for liver-directed therapy (abscopal effect) to pembrolizumab plus liver-directed therapy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for patients with metastatic well-differentiated (WD) neuroendocrine tumors (NET)s (WD-NETs).\n\nIII. To evaluate the best observed ORR to pembrolizumab plus peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) according to RECIST 1.1 for patients with metastatic grade 2 and 3 WD-NET (Ki-67 \\> 10%).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapies or PRRT.\n\nII. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapies or PRRT.\n\nIII. Best observed radiographic ORR per modified RECIST (mRECIST) in lesions targeted for liver-directed therapy.\n\nIV. Duration of response in lesions targeted for liver-directed therapy by mRECIST.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare ORR, DOR, and PFS based on immune-related (ir)RECIST with the same measures assessed by RECIST 1.1.\n\nII. To correlate clinical outcomes (ORR, DOR, PFS) with baseline immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 staining in cycle 1 and cycle 5 tumor biopsies.\n\nIII. To assess the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue prior to liver-directed therapy (prior to PRRT) and 5 weeks following liver-directed therapy (following PRRT).\n\nIV. To assess T cell infiltration on the pre-177Lu-DOTATATE (pre-PRRT) and on the on-treatment tumor tissue biopsies.\n\nV. To assess baseline circulating T cell receptor (TCR) repertories and changes in TCR repertories with treatment, and correlate baseline and turnover of repertories to clinical outcomes.\n\nVI. To analyze the relationship between baseline tumor proliferative index (as measured by Ki67) and response to therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients originally assigned to 1 of 3 groups. As of 09/15/2022, Groups 2 and 3 are closed to enrollment.\n\nGROUP I (PRRT): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PRRT using 177Lu-DOTATATE(Lutathera®) will be offered to patients with somatostatin receptor positive (SSTR+) tumors with Ki-67 index \\> 20% (well-differentiated grade 3). Patients may have any number of liver and/or extrahepatic lesions with liver parenchyma replacement by tumor \\< 75%. 200±20 millicurie (mCi) of 177Lu-DOTATATE will be administered intravenously per treatment on outpatient basis. Patients will receive a total of four treatments of 177Lu-DOTATATE, administered every 8±1 weeks. Patients with partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) by RECIST v. 1.1 after cycle 4 of pembrolizumab who were treated with PRRT (group 1) would continue to receive systemic IV administrations of 177Lu-DOTATATE every 8 +/-1 weeks for up to four (4) treatments. After completion of four (4) PRRT treatments, pembrolizumab may be administered alone for up to 35 cycles\n\nCLOSED - GROUP II (TRANSARTERIAL EMBOLIZATION (TAE)): Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I. Patients with any number of liver lesions, largest being no larger than 5 cm, who have \\< 75% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors, undergo TAE over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the first dose of pembrolizumab.\n\nCLOSED - GROUP III (RADIOEMBOLIZATION (RE)): Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I. Patients with any number of liver lesions, largest measuring more than 5 cm, who have \\< 75% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors, undergo yttrium-90 microsphere RE 3-15 days following the first dose of pembrolizumab.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6 months thereafter.",

RGS in GEP-NETs, mainly with gamma-probes, has been not widely accepted since the low rates of sensitivity and, in particular, specificity, in discriminating tumoral/ non tumoral tissue and background ratio.

Chemotherapy drugs, such as cabazitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as niraparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cetrelimab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving niraparib with or without cetrelimab, after treatment with cabazitaxel, carboplatin, and cetrelimab, may help control aggressive variant prostate cancer.",

Niraparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as dostarlimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

      "detailed_description": "With increasing use of high-resolution conventional imaging, pancreatic incidentalomas are being diagnosed more frequently. In two recent surgical series, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinomas account for 10-15 % of all pancreatic incidentalomas, the majority ( 75-90 % of cases) well differentiated. The factors affecting the behaviour of pancreatic NETs are differentiation, histological grade, staging, size and intratumoral microvascular density. In updated World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the grading system is based on tumor differentiation, the rate of proliferation and Ki-67 index. The management of pancreatic NETs depends on tumor stage and on presence or not of hormonal syndrome. By definition, the incidentally discovered pancreatic NETs (PNETs) are unassociated with hormonal syndromes (nonfunctioning) and detected in patients who undergo diagnostic evaluations for unrelated conditions.\n\nThe therapeutic approach for hormonally functional tumor, or large tumor (\\> 2 cm) with local, vascular or lymph nodes invasion, highly suggestive of malignancy, or in presence of metastasis, is well admitted: surgery is indicated or should be discussed.\n\nHowever, the attitude is less consensual for small (≤ 2 cm) non-functioning (NF) and non-metastatic lesions. There is a paucity of literature reporting pancreatic neuroendocrine incidentalomas and their characteristics. However, given their increased incidence, they are an emerging problem and require changes in treatment guidelines. In English, American or French recommendations, systematic surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is currently recommended in all medically fit patients. The follow-up (FU) is possible for tumors \\<2 cm (T1) located in the pancreatic head and for which enucleation is not feasible. This therapeutic approach has two limitations: 1) the significant incidence of these tumors, because of the widespread use of routine imaging, and the improved technology of multi detector CT scan, the fortuitous discovery of small pancreatic incidentalomas is becoming more common. 2) Pancreatic surgery carries significant postoperative morbidity even in high-volume tertiary centers and even in parenchyma-preserving resection. This may results in many pancreatic resections for tumors with unknown natural history. On the other hand, the follow-up may be a factor of considerable anxiety, and carries the risk, actually difficult to assess, to let the tumor grow between two monitoring controls, with the possible evolution to the irreversible metastatic stage of the disease.\n\nAs a result, the investigators are unceasingly facing a dilemma: how to manage asymptomatic patients with small incidentally detected, potentially benign NETs? Several recently published retrospective studies discuss the \"non- surgical\" management of the small NF incidentally detected pancreatic NETs (IPNETs) and highlight the necessity of developing guidelines for management of these patients. A strict correlation between tumor size and malignancy of these tumors was demonstrated in the single-center retrospective Italian study of Bettini and col. , which included all patients with NF PNETs who underwent curative (R0) resection during 18 years.

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well antiandrogen therapy (leuprolide, apalutamide, and abiraterone acetate) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) works in treating patients with prostate cancer that has come back and has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leuprolide, apalutamide, and abiraterone acetate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving antiandrogen therapy and SBRT may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer.",
