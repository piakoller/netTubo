      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to compare streptozotocin (STZ) vs everolimus as first line treatment for advanced pNET and to elucidate which sequence of STZ based chemotherapy and the mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, everolimus, gives better results in terms of second Progression Free Survival (PFS) in well differentiated and advanced pancreatic NETs.",
      "detailed_description": "STZ plus 5-Fuorouracil (5FU) is the actual standard of care for advanced pancreatic Neuroendocrine tumours (pNETS) in the European Union. Everolimus has been recently approved for its use in advanced pNETs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in Europe by the European Medical Agency (EMA).\n\nA randomized study is needed to have a clear knowledge about the best sequence for its administration; this is, before or after palliative chemotherapy.\n\nThere may or may not be any benefits from giving first each other treatment of the study. The information obtained from this study will help the physician improve the treatment and management of patients with advanced pNET.\n\nThis study was planned to compare STZ-5FU chemotherapy followed by everolimus upon progression versus the reverse sequence. However sequential studies with pNETs are hard to be managed in terms of time and costs. Therefore the protocol was amended to have PFS1 (progression free survival after course 1) as primary endpoint and PFS2 (i.e. progression free survival after both STZ based chemotherapy and Everolimus or the reverse order) as secondary endpoint. This information will be extremely valuable for the day to day clinical practice of pNETs oncologists",

Lanreotide (Somatuline® Depot) Injection and Yttrium-90 microspheres (SIR-Spheres®) each have FDA approval to treat patients with metastatic NETs. The purpose of this study is to determine if treatment for patients with NETs can be optimized by combining these therapies.",

Radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres (SIR-Spheres® therapy) is FDA-approved for treating liver metastases from colorectal cancer. While each of these individual treatments has had promising results, investigators hypothesize that treatment for patients with NETs can be optimized by co-administration of both therapies. Patients will receive treatment with lanreotide (120 mg subcutaneously every 28 days) in combination with SIR-Spheres therapy. The dose and treatment day of SIR-Spheres will be determined by the treating radiation oncologist. Patients who are currently receiving or have previously received lanreotide are eligible, and treatment with lanreotide can continue monthly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis are not eligible due to their extremely poor prognosis and since it is unclear whether the investigational agent penetrates the blood-brain barrier.

Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or of which to minimize use. The Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card should be provided to patients. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 as a DDR inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620.

Patients will be dosed Nivolumab 240mg IV over 60 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W) and Ipilimumab 1mg/kg IV over 30 minutes every 6 weeks (Q6W). One cycle will include 3 doses of Nivolumab and 1 dose of Ipilimumab. The objective of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate of combination Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in advanced, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors. Durability of response, and progression free survival (PFS) will also be described.",
      "detailed_description": "Subjects with progressive, non-functional advanced or metastatic thoracic, GI or pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET) have few treatment options. The only FDA approved treatment regimen offers little response potential. In currently unpublished data with inhibitory immune checkpoint agents, patients with NET have shown promising clinical benefit. This therapy offers a novel approach to potentially provide long term benefit, but must be further explored. The safety profile of nivolumab plus ipilimumab is characterized by immune-related toxicities, such as diarrhea, rash, pneumonitis, liver toxicity, and endocrinopathies (Nivolumab, Ipilimumab Investigator's Brochures). The frequencies and intensities of these events in the combination are variable and depend on the specific doses and schedule used. In the dosing schedules selected, these events were mostly low grade and manageable with the use of corticosteroids. Nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy has shown improved efficacy over either agent alone in melanoma. Rationale for Single Arm Design This study will use a single arm open-label design. The objective of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate of combination nivolumab and ipilimumab in advanced, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors.

      "brief_summary": "Despite the low androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer, there is persistent AR expression observed in the majority of treatment-emergent small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-SCNC) biopsies. This indicates that epigenetic dysregulation leads to reprogramming away from an AR-driven transcriptional program. Therefore, continuation of AR blockade in the form of apalutamide may provide additive benefit compared to immune checkpoint blockade alone. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of apalutamide plus cetrelimab will achieve a clinically significant composite response rate with sufficient durability of response in mCRPC patients with evidence of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer",

      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consists of the screening period (up to 2 weeks) followed by the treatment period (4 treatment administrations at 8-week interval), and the follow-up period (10 years).\n\nThe treatment period will consist of 4 Lutathera treatments administered at 8-week intervals. Lutathera administration will occur on Week 1 Day 1 of each cycle. Each patient will receive a total of 4 doses of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi). An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with each Lutathera dose for renal protection according to the approved Lutathera local prescribing information. An antiemetic will be administered prior to infusion of the AA solution for prevention of infusion-related nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe dosimetry and PK assessments will be performed during the first week after the 1st Lutathera dose, i.e. one time during the study treatment period for each patient. The dosimetry analysis will allow for estimation from the 1st Lutathera administration of the cumulative absorbed radiation dose from 4 Lutathera doses and also for taking a decision on the next dose levels. In the exceptional circumstances when dosimetry cannot be performed in a particular patient after the first Lutathera dose, it should be completed as soon as feasible upon a later dose. In order to minimize risk for each study subject, an accelerated analysis of dosimetry and safety data will be performed for each patient in the study, to enable the Investigator to take a decision for the subsequent Lutathera doses. The results of dosimetry assessments (imaging and blood dosimetry) will be provided to the investigators for their evaluation prior to administration of subsequent therapeutic cycles in each patient.\n\nA total follow-up period of 10 years (120 months) after the last Lutathera dose will take place for each patient who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This follow-up period will be comprised of a short-term follow-up of 6 months to evaluate cumulative Lutathera toxicities, followed by a long-term follow up of another 114 months.\n\nAn external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also operate in the study to evaluate accumulating safety and dosimetry data, to ensure the safety of adolescents enrolled in the study, and to provide recommendations to investigators as well as to the clinical team in charge of conducting the study.",

Hormone therapy such as antiandrogen therapy may fight prostate cancer by blocking the production and interfering with the action of hormones. Abiraterone acetate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Neutron radiation therapy uses high energy neutrons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. It is not yet known whether antiandrogen therapy, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone with or without neutron radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer.",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well pazopanib hydrochloride works in treating patients with carcinoid tumors that are growing, spreading, or getting worse. Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. For patients with progressive carcinoid tumors, progression-free survival (PFS defined by central review according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \\[RECIST\\] 1.1) will be compared between patients randomized to treatment with pazopanib (pazopanib hydrochloride) versus placebo.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Overall survival (OS) will be compared between treatment arms. II. Objective response rate, duration of response, and time to treatment failure will be compared between treatment arms.\n\nIII. Progression free survival (PFS) as assessed by central radiology review and local radiology review will be compared overall and within treatment arms.\n\nIV. Safety and tolerability of treatment with pazopanib/placebo will be evaluated within each treatment arm.\n\nV. PFS and other indicators of efficacy will be estimated in patients who crossover to pazopanib from placebo.\n\nVI. To determine the turn-around time for timely adjudicated central review. VII. To characterize the nature of discordance between local and central radiology review in assessment of progression.\n\nVIII. To characterize the type and rate of progression in carcinoid (at study entry, on-study, and at progression).\n\nIX. To develop new methods for modeling carcinoid growth and detecting treatment effects, and to perform simulations that advance new clinical trial designs to apply to future trials of carcinoid therapeutics.\n\nX. To assess for differences in quality of life (QOL)-related domains between the two treatment groups (pazopanib versus placebo).\n\nXI. To determine if the more brief measures of QOL-related domains provide comparable information to that which is provided by the longer assessments (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer \\[EORTC\\], neuroendocrine tumors \\[NET\\]21).\n\nXII. To provide validation data for the EORTC NET21 module in terms of responsiveness over time and differences across arms.\n\nXIII. To determine whether components of the plasma angiome panel that have been shown to be predictive previously (interleukin-6 \\[IL-6\\] and vascular endothelial growth factor \\[VEGF\\]-D) are predictive of a therapeutic advantage for pazopanib treatment in baseline samples from the patients treated on A021202.\n\nXIV. To determine whether other components of the plasma angiome panel tested (not IL-6 and VEGF-D) are predictive of a therapeutic advantage for pazopanib treatment in baseline samples from the patients treated on A021202.\n\nXV. To evaluate the changes in the plasma angiome markers after treatment with or without pazopanib over time.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. PFS at 6 months will be estimated within each treatment arm. II. Biochemical response (for chromogranin A, defined as a decrease of 50% or more in chromogranin A levels from baseline and for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid \\[5-HIAA\\], defined as a decrease of 50% or more in urinary 5-HIAA levels from baseline) will be compared between treatment arms among patients with elevated baseline levels of chromogranin A (CGA) and 5-HIAA.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) during screening. Patients also undergo computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and chest x-ray throughout the trial. Patients may optionally undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. At the time of progressive disease, patients may cross-over to Arm I. Patients undergo ECHO or MUGA during screening. Patients also undergo CT, MRI, and chest x-ray throughout the trial. Patients may optionally undergo blood sample collection during screening and on study.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 5 years.",

Estimate the objective response rate (RR) of ziv-aflibercept among patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET)s according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n\nII. Test the following hypotheses: that baseline perfusion computed tomography (CT) parameters can predict which patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) will respond to treatment with ziv-aflibercept.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate progression free survival (PFS) duration among patients treated with ziv-aflibercept.\n\nII. Evaluate the relationship between response rate and baseline blood volume (BV) and between response rate and baseline permeability surface (PS).\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BV expressed as relative change from baseline correlate with response to ziv-aflibercept.\n\nII. Determine whether post-treatment tumor blood flow (BF) (absolute measurement) correlates with response to ziv-aflibercept.\n\nIII. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BF and, BV, expressed as relative change from baseline, correlate with relative change in sum of tumor diameters (RECIST 1.1 measurements).\n\nIV. Determine the effect of ziv-aflibercept therapy on post-treatment blood flow (BF), BV, mean transit time (MTT), and PS at 4 weeks after treatment.\n\nV. Evaluate the changes in tumor perfusion parameters at time of progression.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography perfusion imaging at baseline, day 21 of course 1, and at time of progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.",

      "detailed_description": "Preclinical data suggest that concomitant inhibition of two non-redundant amplified pathways (mTOR and EGFR) can reverse drug resistance and more profoundly affect tumor growth than targeting either pathway alone. EGFR inhibitors may abrogate feedback loops that stimulate upstream signaling events such as PI3K and Akt in the face of mTOR inhibition. Although ErbB receptors signal through mTOR-dependent mechanisms, mTOR-independent ErbB receptor signaling also occurs in cancer. Furthermore, deregulation of apoptotic pathways like the PI3K/Akt/PTEN axis (e.g. via PTEN loss of function or AKT gene amplification) may lead to resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Treatment with an inhibitor of mTOR may reverse this resistance. Targeting the mTOR and EGFR pathways concurrently may more effectively inhibit tumor growth than inhibiting either pathway alone.\n\nThe compelling preclinical data, coupled with modest single agent activity seen with EGFR inhibition and mTOR inhibition in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), provides a strong rationale for studying the activity of concomitant pathway inhibition in patients with advanced NETs. Support for this strategy also stems from the fact that EGFR inhibitors can be safety combined with mTOR inhibitors in humans. Emerging data from a phase I study of RAD001 plus erlotinib in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) suggests that the two agents can be safely combined at the following doses: RAD001 5 mg PO q D and erlotinib 150 mg PO qD.\n\nOf note, the original dose selections for RAD001 and erlotinib for this study stem directly from phase I studies with this combination (RAD001 5 mg PO qD plus erlotinib 150 mg PO qD). The modified dose selections (RAD001 5 mg PO qD plus erlotinib 100 mg PO qD) are the result of integrating discussions with the study sponsor, preliminary safety data from the first few patients enrolled in this study (suggesting that some patients tolerate full-dose therapy and others do not) and additional phase I data suggesting that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in some patient populations is lower than in others, e.g. the MTD in breast cancer patients is RAD001 2.5 mg PO qD and erlotinib 100 mg PO QD (Mayer et al.

The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of ramucirumab in advanced, progressive carcinoid tumors.\n\nCancer cells can make growth factors that cause the abnormal growth of new blood vessels. Ramucirumab is an investigational drug which works by blocking a receptor for a vascular growth factor, thereby preventing new blood vessels from forming. This may stop the cancer from growing or spreading and the tumor cells may die.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ramucirumab for treatment of Carcinoid Tumors.",

      "brief_summary": "It is well known that the prevalence of malnutrition or risk of malnutrition in cancer patients is high, as well as its impact on different parameters such as hospitalization, survival or response to certain treatments. In patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), due to their heterogeneity and longer survival, it is expected that the prevalence of malnutrition is probably underdiagnosed, as well as the existence of a negative impact on different parameters (quality of life, survival). So far, the studies carried out on nutrition and NET are very scarce and none has been carried out so far in Spain.\n\nBefore being able to carry out nutritional intervention studies on these patients, it is necessary to know the reality of the nutritional status of patients with NETs in Spain. The main motivation for the NUTRIGETNE study is to evaluate the epidemiological status of nutrition in NETs in the spanish population. In addition to know the epidemiological picture, it is intended to study the nutritional status from different points of view: analytical, clinical, anthropometric, etc. Besides, the study of nutritional status will allow us to closely monitor the patients who have a higher risk of malnutrition and to propose early interventions for those, as well as the impact of their nutritional status on different parameters: survival, hospitalization, quality of life or responses to the treatments.\n\nNUTRIGETNE is a cross-sectional, open and multicenter study in which the nutritional status of patients with GEP NET in Spain will be evaluated.",

The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed to assess the eligibility of the patient. The implications of the study will be explained to the patient and the informed consent will be signed.\n\nVisit for assessment of nutritional status (days 0-10): taking a medical history, complete physical examination including anthropometry, bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and dynamometry, as well as laboratory analysis. The evaluation of the nutritional status will be carried out by a registered nutritionist, specialized nurse or specialist doctor (variable depending on the characteristics of the center).\n\nData collection (day 10-40): collection of analytical, anthropometric, BIA, dynamometry and clinical results and introduction into the electronic case report form (eCRF).\n\nAfter the end of recruitment and database lock, all data will be subsequently analyzed and presented when applicable through study reports and scientific communications.",

      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nTargeted therapies designed for specific genetic alterations, known as cancer driver mutations, have changed the treatment paradigm in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective in NSCLC with activating mutation in the EGFR. Although most patients achieve robust responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with tumor shrinkage and symptomatic relief, drug resistance eventually develops in the majority of patients.\n\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation has been reported as one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.\n\nSeveral phase III trials showed durable response with poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the breast and ovarian cancer with breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation, a tumor suppressor gene involving homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, and several PARP inhibitors are now Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for these cancers.\n\nImmune checkpoint blockade appears to be most effective against hypermutated tumors, suggesting that clinical responses correlate with an increased propensity to produce neoantigens.\n\nEGFR-mutated transformed SCLC is an aggressive cancer whose clinical course is similar to that of SCLC. There are no standard treatments for this disease and prospective studies have not been conducted to date. Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone are not effective for EGFR-mutated transformed SCLC. Analyses of EGFR transformed SCLC tumors suggest that these tumors are HRR deficient.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo assess the efficacy of a combination of durvalumab and olaparib with respect to best overall response (BOR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST 1.1) in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that transform to SCLC and other neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nEligibility:\n\nSubjects with initial diagnosis of EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and histologically or cytologically confirmed transformation to small cell/neuroendocrine tumors following treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\nSubjects should have received platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy for small cell/neuroendocrine transformation or refused such therapy.\n\nAge \\>=18 years.\n\nSubjects must have measurable disease.\n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \\<= 2\n\nAdequate organ function\n\nDesign:\n\n-This is an open label Phase II study evaluating the combination of durvalumab and olaparib\n\nin participants with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma and histologically or cytologically confirmed transformation to small cell/neuroendocrine tumors following treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\nPatients will be treated with durvalumab (1,500 mg), intravenous (IV), every 28 days and olaparib (300 mg twice a day (BID) for total daily dose of 600 mg) in a 28-day cycles.\n\nPatients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, and for response every 8 (+/-1) weeks by RECIST 1.1\n\nTreatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.",

      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to allow continued use of pasireotide in patients who are on pasireotide treatment in a Novartis-sponsored study and are benefiting from the treatment as judged by the investigator.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a multi-center, open label, phase IV study to provide continued supply of pasireotide to patients being treated in a current Novartis-sponsored study and who are benefiting from treatment with pasireotide alone or in combination with another treatment for Cushing's Disease and Acromegaly . Eligible patients are to be consented and can then continue treatment with pasireotide alone or in combination with another treatment for Cushing's Disease and Acromegaly in this protocol. All patients at their scheduled visits will have drug dispensing information and reported adverse events and serious adverse events collected.\n\nA patient will reach the end of study when pasireotide treatment is permanently discontinued and the end of treatment visit has been performed. All patients must be followed up for safety evaluations for 3 months following the last dose of pasireotide LAR treatment and for 1 month following the last dose of pasireotide s.c. treatment.\n\nThe study is expected to remain open for approximately 10 years or until such time that enrolled patients no longer need treatment with pasireotide or are able to obtain commercial supply according to local regulations for their medical condition.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient is currently participating in a Novartis-sponsored study receiving pasireotide (LAR and/or s.c.) on monotherapy or combination therapy (for Cushing's Disease or Acromegaly), and has fulfilled all required assessments in the parent study and patients that are benefiting from the study treatment have no other alternatives.\n2. Patient is currently benefiting from the treatment with pasireotide, as determined by the investigator\n3. Patient has demonstrated compliance, as assessed by the investigator, with the parent study requirements.\n4. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans and any other study procedures.\n5. Written informed consent obtained prior to enrolling in roll-over study and receiving study medication.\n\n   * If consent cannot be expressed in writing, it must be formally documented and witnessed, ideally via an independent trusted witness.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patient has been permanently discontinued from pasireotide study treatment in the parent study due to unacceptable toxicity, non-compliance to study procedures, withdrawal of consent or any other reason.\n2. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a positive hCG laboratory test.\n3. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during the study treatment and for 30 days after the final dose of pasireotide s.c. and 84 days after the final dose of pasireotide LAR. Highly effective contraception is defined as either:\n\n   * Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception\n   * Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n   * Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to enrolling). For female patients on the study the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient.\n   * Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate \\<1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.\n   * In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.\n   * Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child-bearing potential.\n   * Sexually active males, unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for 1 months after pasireotide s.c. last dose and 3 months after pasireotide LAR last dose, should not father a child in this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.",

To assess overall survival (OS) in all patients. III. Assess changes in quality of life (QOL) throughout treatment using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) - Gastrointestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors (NET) 21 (GI.NET21) questionnaire for carcinoid patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors, in all patients who have filled out at least two QOL questionnaires and, will be reported by groups based on response (response, stable disease or progressive disease).\n\nIV. Steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of nintedanib, biomarkers, regulatory T cell (Treg) and cytokine expression and growth factors will be analyzed for all patients and reported in groups based on response.\n\nV. Gene mutations and copy number alterations analysis in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway (will be performed only on the first 10 patients), protein expression of activation of protein kinase B (Akt) (as well as other downstream targets).\n\nVI. Toxicity (graded using the National Cancer Institute \\[NCI\\] Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events \\[CTCAE\\] version 4.0) will be closely monitored and all toxicities will be tabulated.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nintedanib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.
