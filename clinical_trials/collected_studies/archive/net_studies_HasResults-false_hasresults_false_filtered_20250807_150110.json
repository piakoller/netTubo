      "brief_summary": "Measurement of plasma chromogranin A remains the most commonly used biomarkers for both screening and monitoring of patients with gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (GEP-NET), despite several limitations that include: lack of a reference CgA standard; wide variations depending on the used assay in different laboratories; and varying sensitivity ranges from 60 to 90% with low specificity \\<50%, depending on the population studied.\n\nSurprisingly, and to the best of our knowledge, only three studies with small numbers of participants have been published that have investigated possible effects of food intake on the measurement of CgA. Most have been performed in healthy controls or patients on treatment with proton pump inhibitors for chronic gastritis (up to n = 11 per group) but only one study has investigated patients with GEP-NET, where n = 6 patients with gastric NET were included.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aim to assess the time dependent effects of normally ingested diet (5-item English breakfast; or tea or coffee; or ongoing fasted state) on plasma chromogranin A measurements, using timed measurements over 180 min following an \\> 10 hours overnight fast, in a randomised double-crossover design. The investigators aimed to include 25 - 35 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a GEP-NET of varying primary tumour location, tumour stage, grade; and presence or absence of treatment with long acting somatostatin analogues; as well as 10 - 15 healthy controls.

Disease progression must be demonstrated on two scans less than one year apart.\n\n  * Participants previously treated with any systemic therapies are eligible to enroll if disease progression is documented during or after their last treatment.\n* Measurable disease as assessed by CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis which is suitable for accurate repeated measurements (according to RECIST v1.1).\n* ECOG performance status 0-2.\n* Adequate bone marrow function (ANC \\> 1.5 x 109/L; Platelets \\>100 x109/L; haemoglobin \\> 90 g9/L).\n* Adequate liver function defined by a total bilirubin level ≤1.5xULN and AST and ALT levels ≤2.5xULN for participants (or AST and ALT levels ≤ 5xULN for participants with documented metastatic disease to the liver).\n* Adequate renal function defined by an estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula (or local institutional standard method).\n* Willing and able to comply with all study requirements, including timing and/or nature of treatment and required assessments.\n* Signed, written informed consent.\n* Evidence of post-menopausal status, or negative urine or serum pregnancy test for female pre-menopausal participants (within approximately 14 days prior to enrolment). Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrhoeic for 12 months without an alternative medical explanation.\n* Highly effective contraception for both male and female participants if the risk of conception exists (note: The effects of the IP on the developing human fetus are unknown; thus, women of childbearing potential and men able to father a child must agree to use 2 highly effective contraceptions, defined as methods with a failure rate of less than 1% per year. Highly effective contraception is required at least 28 days prior, throughout and for at least 60 days after avelumab treatment.)\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Grade 1 NET or Grade 3 poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma, or mixed adenoneuroendocrine carcinomas (MANEC)\n* NETs confirmed to be from primaries other than the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, or lung\n* Prior use of PD-1, PD-L1 or CTLA-4 inhibitors\n* Life expectancy of ≤3 months\n* Concurrent treatment with other anticancer therapy (except somatostatin analogues for the purposes of functional control). Participants on somatostatin analogues for anti-proliferative therapy should have this therapy ceased, and would be eligible for enrolment if they have not received somatostatin analogues in the past 14 days.\n* Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory agent, with exception to:\n* Subjects with diabetes type I, vitiligo, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid disease not requiring immunosuppressive treatment are eligible\n* Active infection requiring systemic therapy.\n* History of primary autoimmunodeficiency\n* Current use of immunosuppressive medication, EXCEPT for the following: a. intranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injection (e.g., intra-articular injection); b.

These patients will demonstrate the ability of the MOT to prospectively collect data using the same protocol and related documents, standardized data elements and processes, and accepted scientific endpoints; and (2) Analysis Cohorts. The modular nature of the study allows collection of RWD ranging from diagnosis only to the full treatment course of the of the patient. Patients are grouped to allow focused data collection or a specific analysis. Analysis cohorts can be created from patients already enrolled in ROOT or be defined prospectively. Because of the ongoing advancements of molecular based oncology, this trial allows a detailed focus on molecular testing as part of any cohort.\n\nData is reported by the group that is most qualified to provide this information and is proved, at point of care, using standardized data elements and processes. Physicians will report diagnosis, molecular characteristics, staging, disease burden, significant comorbidities, treatment response, and medical decision making. Molecular testing (reports and details) will be requested from testing laboratories. Any diagnostic films will be received digitally from the location the study was performed.

      "brief_summary": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a diagnostic imaging technique that uses positron emission (e-) to image changes in diagnosed tissues. Detector systems are an important part of PET scanners. They can convert gamma photons into fluorescent photons to obtain information about energy, time and position, of the gamma photons obtained through the use of an appropriate positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical. Conventional PET scanners are expensive mostly because they require the use of LSO (lutetium oxyorthosilicate) or LYSO (lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate) scintillation crystals. Such crystal scintillators are very costly and difficult to obtain, which limits accessibility of the PET- scanners. The prototype J-PET scanner tested in this trial uses plastic scintillators in which different physical phenomena occur compared to crystal scintillators. In addition, the J-PET scanner prototype is equipped with unique software enabling three-photon imaging, based on the annihilation resulting from the formation of the orto-positronium (o-Ps) in diagnosed tissue. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the clinical acceptability of such scanners based on plastic scintillators, which can additionally collect and process information on the lifetime of o-Ps derived from routinely used radiopharmaceuticals. Additionally, the aim of this study is to demonstrate the use of the new diagnostic indicator \"positronium biomarker\" in a prospective study, compared to routine diagnostic scanning.",
      "detailed_description": "The J-PET scanner is the world's first positron tomograph based on plastic strip scintillators to measure the lifetime of the ortho-positronium (o-Ps) atom. This is a modular scanner, designed and installed at the Department of Experimental Particle Physics and Applications of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. The J-PET scanner is based on technology patented in 2014 and 2016.\n\nThe J-PET scanner, unlike PET scanners commonly used in diagnostics, has three important features:\n\n1. J-PET scintillators are made of plastic instead of expensive-to-produce LSO (lutetium oxyorthosilicate) or LYSO (lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate) scintillation crystals use in regular PET scanners;\n2. J-PET is modular and can be adapted to the patient's size and expanded to a total-body PET scanner because;\n3. J-PET can be used to test an additional parameter called the \"positronium biomarker\" which has not been used so far.\n\nAd. 1. Conventional PET scanners use LSO or LYSO scintillation crystals, which exploit the photoelectric effect and convert gamma photons into fluorescent photons to obtain information on the energy, time and position of gamma photons emitted by the positron annihilation (e+) process obtained by using an appropriate e+ emitting radiopharmaceutical. In plastic scintillators used in J-PET, the Compton effect is used, i.e. the phenomenon of scattering of high-energy photons on free or weakly bound electrons of the scintillator.\n\nAd. 2. The modular J-PET scanner can also be easily integrated with existing computed tomography (CT) systems, allowing for simultaneous conduction of both types of examinations.\n\nAd. 3. Positronium imaging is applied in the J-PET scanner. The PET technique uses radioisotopes that emit positron radiation (beta+). Traditional PET scanners image the distribution of gamma ray photons produced by the annihilation of an electron (e-) and a positron (e+). Annihilation may be preceded by the appearance of a positron atom - a quasi-stable system composed of an electron (e-) and its antiparticle - positron (e+), which occurs in approximately 30-40% of all annihilations occurring in the patient's body.\n\nThe time of such annihilation taking place through the state of the positronium atom depends on whether a positronium will be created in which e- and e+ will have parallel spins (triplet state ↑↑, this system is called ortho-positronium - o-Ps) or antiparallel spins (state singlet ↑ ↓, this system is called para-positronium - p-Ps). The average life time of o-Ps in vacuum is more then 1000 times longer (142 nano-seconds \\[ns\\]), then the average life time of p-Ps (125 pico-seconds \\[ps\\]). The average lifetime of o-Ps in a vacuum is over 1000 times longer (142 nanoseconds \\[ns\\]) than the average lifetime of p-Ps (125 picoseconds \\[ps\\]). The second difference is that o-Ps annihilation takes place over 3 photons, which has not been detected so far and which traditional PET. the annihilation time of the o-Ps atom can be an additional diagnostic parameter (\"positronium biomarker\") to be measured and analyzed in the J-PET scanner.\n\nThe clinical application of such \"positronium biomarker\" in terms of lesion detection, image quality and quantification is yet to be determined, which this study aims to address.",

      "detailed_description": "This cohort (retro- \\& prospective) study will be conducted at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTTFT) among patients undergoing MRT. Pre and post-therapy blood tests, treatment administration, whole body and SPECT/PET imaging will be undertaken in strict accordance with existing GSTTFT approved protocols for each type of treatment. With the exception of hyperthyroid patients receiving I-131 therapy, these procedures are all part of the standard of care at GSTT. Hyperthyroid patients will be required to have one whole-body scan at 24hrs post-therapy activity administration in addition to their standard care. This will not result in additional radiation exposure.\n\nThe decision to proceed with MRT will have been agreed upon at the relevant multidisciplinary meeting in accordance with current practice guidelines. Pre and post-therapy blood tests, whole body and SPECT/PET imaging will be followed as per current GSTTFT protocols. Patients will be asked to undertake the following:\n\n1. Neuroendocrine tumour and thyroid cancer patients: 1-7 days treatment whole-body gamma camera and SPECT /CT scan. (Part of standard of care post-treatment monitoring at GSTTFT).\n\n   \\*Hyperthyroid patients: 24-hour post-treatment whole-body gamma camera scan. (Part of this research protocol, will not involve any additional radiation).\n2. Record SELFIE reading for 28 days post-therapy using the sheet provided. (Part of this research protocol).\n3. Complete feedback questionnaire. (Part of this research protocol). \\*Benign thyroid disease patients only: Reasonable travel expenses for the cost of an additional hospital visit for post-treatment scans will be reimbursed from the nuclear medicine research fund SPF228. (Maximum reimbursement 50 £)\n\nFor the purpose of this study, two dosimetry methods will be used and compared.\n\n1. Whole-body self-monitored retention measurements study (SELFIE study):\n\n   A handheld radiation monitor (ATOMTEX model AT6130, Belarus) will be used to follow the time course of radioactivity clearance in each patient. The measurement device (SELFIE device) will be introduced to patients by a member of the medical physics team. Patients will be shown how to operate and record readings obtained and will also receive illustrated written instructions to build confidence. The devices are user friendly and patients will be asked to record the measurements twice daily using a diary sheet, typically taking about one minute to complete on each occasion. Measurement can begin immediately following administration and will continue for 28 days afterwards.\n\n   Following MRT administration, a standard whole-body dosimetry measurement will be taken by a medical physicist at 1 and 2 meters distance. The patient will begin to take SELFIE readings at the same time under supervision so that their records can be compared with the physicists' results.\n\n   After 28 days, patients will be asked to return the diary sheet and SELFIE monitor by post to GSTTFT in a pre-paid, pre-addressed envelope.\n\n   On completion of the 28-day exercise, patients will be asked to complete and return a feedback questionnaire.\n\n   The paper record of SELFIE readings will be reviewed by investigators from each patient for 28 days post-therapy. All imaging will be performed at GSTTFT by specialist Nuclear Medicine/PET staff.\n\n   All acquired images will be reconstructed and analysed by investigators using HERMES software as described in section 13.3.\n2. Imaging response assessment Planar Whole body, SPECT/CT and PET/CT images will be acquired to assess uptake patterns and, in the case of sequential treatments, uptake/retention changes. SPECT/CT, PET/CT and whole-body scans will be performed in accordance with existing protocols at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. This will not result in additional radiation exposure. (Schedule illustrated in 16.1 Appendix).\n\nThe SUV of target and non-target tissues will be calculated from quantitative pre and post-therapy PET/CT and post-therapy SPECT/CT images. As a result, early tumour response and toxicity in patients undergoing molecular targeted radionuclide therapy can be studied.\n\nPatient-led dose rate (SELFIE) data and imaging data will be integrated to compare whole-body retention and evaluate sequential dose rate changes after repeated treatments.\n\nThe quality of SELFIE data will be assessed against pre-specified standards (completeness of data collection, data deviation). Patient satisfaction will be evaluated from the feedback questionnaire.",

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a network of rare tumors with common embryological origin. Functional imaging plays a major role in the extension assessment and tumor characterization of NETs. SPECT/CT with 111In-pentetreotide is the recommended test when tumors are well differentiated (grade G1 or G2). It has a real interest in diagnosis, in therapeutic decision-making (in particular by cold somatostatin analogues or in PRRT) and in the systematic follow-up of patients. Nevertheless, SPECT/CT procedure makes for a relatively long review. In addition, scintigraphy has a lower spatial resolution than PET technology and remains of limited interest for signal quantification.\n\nHowever, the ability to locate and quantitatively measure the absorption of radiopharmaceuticals in the target tissues is a major challenge in oncology for the characterization of the disease.\n\nRecent developments in radiopharmacy have made it possible to target NETs in PET imaging through the use of somatostatin analogues coupled with positron emitters, called 68Ga-DOTA peptides. The diagnostic performance of 68Ga-DOTApeptide PET/CT appears to be superior to SPECT/CT with 111In-pentetreotide. A marketing authorization has thus recently been issued in France for the use of 68Ga-DOTATOC.\n\nHistorically, the recommended quantification method in PET was based on the instantaneous measurement in static acquisition (3D) of the maximum of the standardized uptake value (SUVmax). This approach has the disadvantage to measure the signal at a time \"t\" for a single voxel of the image. Dynamic acquisition methods (4D) have been proposed to extract a radiotracer absorption coefficient (Ki) for a lesion. Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of Ki versus SUVmax in 18FDG PET/CT for the diagnostic management, therapeutic evaluation and prognosis of various solid cancers.\n\nHowever, no work has validated this approach in PET / CT at 68Ga-DOTATOC as part of the prognostic evaluation of NETs.\n\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic value of the tumor absorption coefficient Ki resulting from a 4D whole-body dynamic acquisition in PET / CT at 68Ga-DOTATOC in patients with well-differentiated NETs grade I or II according to the WHO classification",

      "brief_summary": "Background Treatment and control of cancer is associated with high costs, to patients in the form of side effects and discomfort during investigations, to society in the form of expensive drugs and studies.\n\nCirculating tumor cells (CTC) has received great attention as a cancer biomarker in trying to estimate future course in patients with breast cancer, colon cancer and prostate cancer. CTC is believed to be a crucial step in cancer spreading to the bloodstream and giving rise to metastases. Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) specifically adds specificity to the analysis of the CTC.\n\nThe investigators would like to with molecular biological methods predict which patients requires special monitoring and individualized therapy and explore these tests as clinical decision support.\n\nPurpose and method\n\nIn a blood sample from patients with neuro-endocrine tumor (NET) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the investigators will by cell separation, flow cytometry and DNA sequencing and digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR):\n\n1. Identify and isolate the CTC and investigate these for tumor-specific mutations.\n2. Quantify ctDNA and analyze this for specific mutations, which in the past has been found frequent in NET and HCC.\n3. Compare findings of mutations on CTC and ctDNA with mutations in tissue biopsies.\n\nThe results are compared with the clinical data on disease course, including the effect of treatment and survival.\n\nSubjects 40 Patients with small intestinal/unknown primary NET before treatment with somatostatin analogues 30 patients with pancreatic NET before treatment with Everolimus 30 patients with presumed radically treated HCC 30 patients with HCC in treatment with Sorafenib A blood sample will be taken prior to the start of treatment, after 1 month after start of treatment and thereafter every 3.-6. month for up to two years.\n\nPerspectives In several cancer types molecular diagnostics have had significant influence in treatment and control strategy. The goal is in future to be able to take advantage of a so-called \"liquid biopsy\" as clinical decision support. The study will bring new knowledge to this growing field of research.",

This study may provide feasibility and response information, which will be the basis for designing better randomized trials, which may change the pattern of cancer treatment. If the hypothesis is finally proved, it will help doctors and molecular biologists to choose the best drug (or combination of drugs) based on the individual oncogenomics of each patient.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a prospective, open label, real-world study to evaluate the feasibility of matched molecular targeted therapy in patients with refractory gastrointestinal cancer based on tumor molecular characteristics as standard treatment failure. This is a non-randomized trial designed to test molecular matching strategies based on patient genome information. The molecular tumor board (MTB) will recommend treatment, but the treatment decision is up to the attending physician. FoundationOne CDx was used for tissue genomic analysis. If possible, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor mutation load (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) status will also be evaluated. Based on this information, MTB, composed of multidisciplinary experts, will focus on the selection of customized, best matched drugs or combinations to target most of the genomic changes in each patient, also taking into account potential drug toxicity. The final treatment will be based on the choice of oncologists, who will formulate treatment plan by combining MTB discussion, patient preference, attention to complications, consideration of drug toxicity, insurance coverage of off label drugs and availability of clinical trials of research drugs, thus reflecting the actual clinical practice nowadays in China. The acquisition of drugs follows the actual situation in the real world and is not within the scope of this study design.\n\nThe principles of MTB treatment recommendations can be referred to the NCI-MATCH trial:\n\nGrade 1: FDA / NMPA approval; clear evidence and mechanism; concomitant diagnostic relationship between drug and target.\n\nGrade 2: The drug reaches the clinical end point (objective response rate, PFS or OS); there is evidence of target inhibition; there is strong evidence to predict relationship between the target and the drug.\n\nGrade 3: The drug has evidence of clinical activity and target inhibition; there is some evidence to predict the relationship between target and drug.\n\nGrade 4: Pre-clinical evidence of anti-tumor activity and evidence of target inhibition; there is hypothesis to predict the relationship between target and drug.\n\nPatients who meet the inclusion criteria and sign informed consent will be analyzed for tumor mutation by FoundationOne CDx detection. Biopsy specimens of metastatic foci can be selected for gene detection. If there is no targeted therapy among patients, the archived diagnostic tumor samples can also be used for detection. If the patient has received targeted therapy, the investigators will try to obtain biopsy samples after treatment. If the sample cannot be tested or the test results are not satisfactory, additional slices need to be sent to the laboratory. If the repeated test fails, repeat biopsy if the clinical conditions permit, or patients should be included in the unmatched treatment group.\n\nDetermining the interventability of gene mutations depends on genomic changes, allele frequency, and diagnosis. This study will combine the recommendations of MTB and gene testing reports to determine the interventability of mutated genes.\n\nInterventional mutation: cancers have FDA or NMPA approved therapies, or there are matching drugs in clinical trials.\n\nNon-interventional mutation: there is no FDA or NMPA approved treatment for cancers, and no matching drug is available in clinical trials.\n\nMTB should at least be composed of attending doctors, molecular pathology experts and bioinformatics experts. The research center is responsible for the establishment and holding of MTB. As management of patients enrolled in this study is essential, the research committee, including but not limited to the main investigator of the study and the treated medical oncologist, can provide advice as needed between MTB meetings to avoid treatment delays. By analyzing the genomic variation of patients, independent MTB recommends molecular targeted therapy that can inhibit the mutation directly or through related pathways or be included in relevant clinical trials. The independent research committee will use the \"N-to-1\" model of precision medicine to propose a matching therapy consisting of at least one drug that targets molecular changes. The investigators expect 50-70% of patients to carry intervening variants, and that proportion is rising rapidly as learning more about these pathways and drugs. The investigators expect that about 40% of patients with intervening variants will be able to receive molecular targeted \"matching\" therapy.",

      "brief_summary": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of concomitant main pancreatic duct exposure, repair, or reconstruction during minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation on long-term patient prognosis and quality of life.",
      "detailed_description": "Standard surgical procedures for benign or low-grade malignant pancreatic tumors is associated with increased risks of postoperative complications and long-term pancreatic functional impairment, while parenchyma-sparing pancreatectomy such as enucleation can reduce the incidence of complications and preserve healthy parenchyma, thereby preserve both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function. It has been reported that pancreatic tumor enucleation is a safe and feasible approach in preserving normal physiological function in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery.\n\nWith the growing emphasis on routine screenings and the application of high-quality thin-slice imaging techniques, the detection rates of pancreatic tumors have witnessed a steady increase. Additionally, there is a notable trend towards younger patients being diagnosed with pancreatic tumors. Consequently, in conjunction with ensuring safe and thorough tumor resection while maximizing preservation of pancreatic function, there is a current clinical demand to further reduce surgical trauma.\n\nLiterature reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that minimally invasive enucleation procedures offer well-known advantages associated with minimally invasive approaches, such as shorter postoperative hospital stays and lower overall complication rates. While the occurrence rate of severe complications, such as postoperative hemorrhage, remains relatively low, the development of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) continues to pose a challenging issue.\n\nThe distance between the tumor and the main pancreatic duct (MPD) is considered a crucial factor influencing the occurrence of POPF after enucleation. However, these data have been rarely described in previous studies, making it challenging to accurately assess their actual impact on the rate of POPF occurrence. Heeger et al. suggested that the risk of POPF increases with closer proximity of the tumor to the MPD. The incidence of POPF was higher in deep-seated tumors after pancreatic enucleation (distance to MPD \\<3 mm) compared to superficial tumors (\\>3 mm) (73.3% vs. 30.0%, P=0.002). Other studies have even limited this critical distance to 2mm. Some research has indicated that if the tumor invades or encases the MPD, enucleation surgery should be contraindicated, and standard resection should be preferred to avoid the risk of POPF postoperatively. However, a retrospective analysis by Strobel et al. on 166 cases of pancreatic tumor enucleation demonstrated that even tumors in close proximity to the MPD can be safely resected, although their study did not include cases with tumor encasement of the MPD.\n\nDuring the expansive growth of solid tumors such as neuroendocrine tumors and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, they can compress the MPD, causing inflammatory adhesions. Cystic tumors can also surround the MPD as they grow. Enucleation of these tumors may inevitably lead to exposure, injury, or transection of the MPD, necessitating repair and reconstruction. Recent years have seen successful cases reported of end-to-end anastomosis of the MPD. Minimally invasive techniques have also facilitated the promotion of MPD repair or bridging reconstruction surgeries. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive research data in this field.\n\nThe safety and feasibility of minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation procedures involving MPD exposure, repair, or reconstruction, the control of POPF, and the long-term prognosis and quality of life of patients after MPD repair or reconstruction remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a prospective cohort study. The results of this study will serve as a valuable reference for clinical practice and promote the development and application of minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation procedures.",

      "detailed_description": "Minimally invasive enucleation (MIEN) has been widely used in managing benign and low-grade malignant pancreatic tumors, showing better protection of pancreatic function and better long-term outcomes compared to standard pancreatectomy.\n\nHowever, the incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) after MIEN is higher compared to standard resection, mainly since a large part of the pancreatic wound is exposed, and the main pancreatic duct may be exposed or injured, etc. POPF is the most important postoperative complication, and it has become a major constraint to the conduct of pancreatic MIEN.\n\nAlthough risk factors and predictive models for POPF in standard pancreatic surgery have been reported in the past, no predictive models have been reported specifically for MEN. With the increasing adoption of MIEN, there is an urgent need for a predictive model to guide the treatment and prognosis of POPF. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a cohort study, with data prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The result of this study will provide a valuable reference for the development and application of MIEN.",

      "brief_summary": "Background: Liver metastases are common in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms, but often underestimated by preoperative imaging. Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) is the reference standard for staging of primary and metastatic liver tumors, with a diagnostic accuracy superior to that of CT and MRI. Rationale: The present study aims to evaluate the contribution of IOUS to staging of liver disease in patients with neuroendocrine tumor candidates for primary tumor resection classified as cM0 at preoperative imaging.\n\nThe study will collect a prospective series of 99 patients undegoing surgery for gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at the Humanitas Clinical Institute (coordinating centre) or at one of the participating centres in the period 2020-2023. All patients had to be cM0 tumor at preoperative imaging. Additional inclusion criteria: age\\>18 years, ability to give the informed consent for study participation; no other malignancies in the previous 5 years; preoperative staging including abdominal CT and DOTATOC PET-CT performed ≤60 days before surgery.\n\nThis prospective observational multicentre study aims to elucidate the proportion of patients with gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cM0 at preoperative imaging that have intraoperative detection of liver metastases at IOUS.\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n- Performances of IOUS in identifying liver metastases in patients with neuroendocrine tumor classified as cM0 at preoperative imaging\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n* Impact of IOUS on the therapeutic strategy\n* Performances of preoperative imaging (CT, MRI and PET-CT) in comparison with those of IOUS\n\nThe study will collect a prospective series of 99 patients undergoing surgery for gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at the Humanitas Clinical Institute (coordinating centre) or at one of the participating centres in the period 2020-2023.\n\nThe study includes the following steps:\n\nPreoperative / enrollment: All patients candidates to resection of gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor will be considered for the study. Only cM0 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study must have performed a preoperative abdominal CT scan with contrast medium and a DOTATOC-PET-CT (both performed ≤60 days before surgery).\n\nIntraoperative: During surgery, the investigator will perform, as standard in our clinical practice, an accurate exploration of the liver by inspection, palpation and IOUS. The investigator will record the identification of any liver lesion. If one or more nodules suspect of being neuroendocrine liver metastases are identified, it will be necessary, whenever possible, as already routinely performed, to carry out a biopsy or to remove it (if superficial) for histological confirmation of the diagnosis. After completion of liver staging, the primary tumor will be resected.\n\nPostoperative / follow-up: Enrolled patients will have standard postoperative management.\n\nStandard statistical analyses will be performed. Per-patient and per-lesion analyses will be performed to asses performances of preoperative imaging modalities (CT, MRI, PET-CT) and of intraoperative ones (inspection, palpation, and IOUS).",

Compared to healthy cells, the surface of these tumor cells has a greater number of special molecules called somatostatin receptors (SSTR).

The 18F-AmBF3-TATE radioactive tracer is manufactured for this study under a Clinical Trial Application filed with Health Canada.\n\nAfter providing informed written consent subjects will complete a medical history questionnaire.\n\nMonitoring of adverse events There will be short-term evaluation of adverse events by comparison of vital signs before and after administration of 18F-AmBF3-TATE . Eighteen to seventy-two hours after 18F-AmBF3-TATE administration the participant will return to the imaging department to perform a follow up safety assessment and routine blood draw. The study coordinator will ask the participant if they have experienced any adverse events during that time period and complete the adverse event questionnaire.\n\nFollow-up Assessments\n\nThe following information will be collected up to 12 months following the PET/CT scans:\n\nInitiation of a new treatment, Laboratory results and pathology reports, Results of imaging studies, Final clinical diagnosis by physician and relevant clinical notes.

Following the amendment 6, up to a maximum of 50 additional patients may be included in the Sarcoma (cohort 1), Rare ovarian cancer (cohort 2) or Primary central nervous system lymphoma (cohort 3) cohorts, within the limit of 350 patients to be included in total.\n\nThe study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.\n\nAll participants who reach the maximum treatment duration per protocol and stop the pembrolizumab with a clinical benefit (prolonged stable disease, partial or complete response), may be eligible for up to an additional 1 year (approximately 17 cycles) of pembrolizumab treatment if they progress during the follow-up period.

Detection of NEN and monitoring of response to therapy is still challenging due to their cellular heterogeneity. Initial preclinical studies suggest that NEN imaging with the use of SSTR2-Antagonist may be advantageous in comparison to the widely used SSTR2-Agonists.\n\nRecently, novel radiopharmaceuticals, based on SSTR2-Antagonists, were shown to provide superior SSTR2 visualisation than currently used agonists. The need for molecular imaging of NEN is expected to grow significantly in the near future due to their increasing incidence and prevalence. Although a persistent trend to shift the molecular imaging of NEN from conventional SPECT/CT gamma cameras to PET/CT has been observed in the last decade, labelling the compound with Tc-99m offers significant advantages by its extremely wide availability, low cost and low radiation exposure to patients. Effective and accessible molecular imaging methods as an integral part of personalised patient management are needed to optimise selection and follow-up of available therapeutic modalities. The Tc-99m-labeled SSTR2-Antagonist \\[99mTc\\]Tc-TECANT1 is expected to be an effective, widely available compound for quantitative assessment of SSTR2 NEN status, allowing a personalised therapeutic approach.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from various endocrine glands, endocrine cells within non-endocrine tissue and diffuse endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and genitourinary tract. Detection of NEN and monitoring of their response to therapy is challenging due to their varied location (often-unknown primary focus) and cellular heterogeneity. NEN exhibit a wide range of histological appearances and biological behaviors, and may all potentially behave in an aggressive manner, irrespective of the initial diagnosis. Consequently, the prediction of clinical outcomes in an individual patient is often difficult and inaccurate. According to some national registries, the incidence of NEN increased more than 6-fold and the prevalence more than 8-fold between 1973 and 2012, making NEN the second most prevalent diagnosis in gastrointestinal malignancies, thus representing a growing challenge. The rise in the incidence can be partly attributed to increased awareness of the disease and better detection methods. Diagnostic imaging is an integral part of the management of patients with NEN by localising the primary or recurrence site, determining the extent of the disease and evaluating response to therapy. Nuclear medicine with single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) is a branch of molecular imaging: in contrast to anatomical imaging, it depicts functional changes and biological characteristics of target tissues, providing a unique insight into the biology of malignant disease, and has established itself as an excellent tool in personalized medicine. The characteristic feature of NEN is an overexpression of somatostatin receptors (SSTR) on cell membranes. Molecular imaging techniques utilise the ability of SST analogues labelled with radioactive (single-photon or positron emitting) nuclides to bind to the SSTR. A combination of molecular and anatomical imaging (hybrid imaging, SPECT/CT and PET/CT) is currently the most sensitive approach to visualisation of SSTR-positive tumours. In NEN patients the prognosis depends on the grade and stage of the tumour. However, SSTR expression determines not only efficacy of staging using molecular imaging methods, but also efficacy of antiproliferative therapy with SST analogues both not radiolabelled (\"cold\") and labelled with a therapeutic radionuclide thus enabling Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) as the main approach to personalised NEN patients' management. Traditionally, radiolabelled SST analogues were constructed aiming at their agonistic behaviour, based on their internalisation after SSTR activation and consequent retention within the tumour cells, believed to be crucial for efficient molecular imaging and therapy. Recently, it has been shown that novel molecular probes, SSTR antagonists, recognise more binding sites and hence improve diagnostic efficacy, especially when the density of SSTR is low. Accumulating preclinical and clinical data using both SPECT and PET tracers shows that high-affinity SSTR antagonists can provide better SSTR visualisation than agonists. Preclinical data and subsequent clinical evaluation demonstrated higher tumour uptake of an In-111-labelled antagonist \\[111In\\]In-DOTA-sst2-ANT (\\[111In\\]In-DOTA-BASS) compared to the agonist \\[111In\\]In-DTPA0-octreotide or \\[111In\\]In -DTPA0-octreotate, as well as superior tumour-to-background ratios. One of the first reports describing the SSTR2 antagonist LM3 indicates the high potential of gallium-68 (Ga-68) and copper-64 (Cu-64) radiolabelled LM3 in PET/CT. The authors demonstrated strong dependence of the affinity and pharmacokinetics of the SST-based radiolabelled antagonists on the chelator and radiometal, also confirmed using another SSTR antagonist, namely JR11. The Superiority of the SSTR antagonist was demonstrated in the Phase I/II clinical study using a positron emitter, \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NODAGA-JR11 and in a pilot study conducted with beta-emitting, therapeutic radionuclide (lutetium-177, Lu-177) labelled SSTR antagonist \\[177Lu\\]Lu-DOTA-JR11. As a result, research in the field is currently strongly focused on SSTR antagonists. Ga-68-labelled SST analogues have already established PET as a unique tool for personalising treatment of NEN. Nevertheless, single-photon emitting radiopharmaceuticals still represent the cornerstone of molecular imaging, particularly those based on Technetium-99m (Tc-99m). Its physical properties (half-life of 6 hours, optimal energy of 140 keV for imaging and lowest radiation exposure), widest on-site availability and cost-effectiveness are of major importance for routine clinical applications. Medical diagnostic imaging techniques using Tc-99m account for approximately 80% of all nuclear medicine procedures, representing 30-40 million examinations worldwide every year; even in developed countries, the number of gamma cameras in use exceeds by far the number of PET systems. Considering the above-mentioned characteristics Tc-99m is perfect for research with new radiotracers and is still recognised as the workhorse of diagnostic nuclear medicine. Quantifiable uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in target tissue using standardised methods and metrics such as standardised uptake value (SUV) is currently a unique feature of PET allowing highly personalized approaches to patient management and is part of clinical routine. It was shown also in NEN that the quantitative approach is able to adequately predict and evaluate the response to various treatments available, including \"cold\" and radiolabelled somatostatin analogues (PRRT). However, single-photon quantitative imaging has developed significantly and is also entering clinical routine. Identical quantitative metrics are becoming available with the use of SPECT/CT systems (SPECT SUV) with comparable accuracy and clinical applicability. The development of a quantitative SPECT imaging approach in NEN, in combination with improved, widely available radiopharmaceuticals, would therefore represent a highly significant improvement in management, tailored to the needs of each individual patient.",

Secondly, variation of circulating NET transcripts will be correlated to NET recurrence to test whether this analysis may constitute an early predictive marker of disease relapse.",
      "detailed_description": "Biomarker-based tools that can accurately predict gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) treatment response and tumor recurrence are currently not available. Circulating biomarkers that are associated with GEP-NETs are limited to measurements of plasma chromogranin A (CgA). The investigators have developed a PCR-based tool to quantitate (score) the circulating GEP-NET molecular signature (\"liquid\" biopsy) with high sensitivity and specificity. This signature can identify all types of GEP-NETs including small (1cm) non-metastatic tumors, is significantly reduced after tumor debulking and is decreased following surgical \"cure\". Elevated post-surgical scores are associated with tumor recurrence within 6 months in \\~40% of cases. Current NET treatment protocols are associated with tumor recurrence (progression free survival) ranging from 5-18 months. The majority of patients will experience a relapse within 18 months irrespective of the treatment approach. The investigators hypothesize that a PCR measurement of circulating NET mRNA can accurately predict the extent of surgical resection (tumor removal) and elevated scores can predict tumor relapse before this occurs. This biomarker protocol seeks to test this hypothesis and evaluate whether changes in plasma CgA are as effective in predicting resection and recurrence.",

Current grading of neuroendocrine tumors are based on the 2010 WHO classification.

Etoposide-based chemotherapy, mostly as the combination with cisplatin, has been the mainstay of the treatment for patients with grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors. However, a recent large retrospective analysis has suggested this regimen may not be effective in relatively low Ki-67 labeling index. Therefore, the investigators designed a clinical trial testing temozolomide-capecitabine combination, which has been mostly investigated in well differentiated (ie., grade 1 or 2) neuroendocrine tumors, in patients with grade 3 and low Ki-67 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.",

      "brief_summary": "Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needles with side fenestrations are used to collect aspirates for cytology analysis and biopsy samples for histologic analysis. The investigators conducted a large, multicenter study to compare the accuracy of diagnosis via specimens collected with fine-needle biopsy (FNB) versus fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for patients with lesions requiring immunohistochemistry (IHC) pathological diagnosis.",
      "detailed_description": "Current guidelines recommend FNA and FNB needles equally for pancreatic and other deep-seated lesions. However, some studies indicate that the sample adequacy for histologic evaluation is higher when using FNB compared with FNA needles. The diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor (NET), autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), and other gastrointestinal stromal tumors require high-quality tissue sampling for IHC diagnosis. Whether FNB is superior to FNA in these IHC-required lesions remains unclear.\n\nThe investigators performed this at 2 tertiary care centers in China. The study prospectively collected patients undergoing EUS for a solid mass (\\>1 cm) in the pancreas, abdomen, mediastinum, or pelvic cavity from December 2014 diagnosed with AIP, NET, mesenchymal tumors, and Lymphoma. Patients accepted FNB or FNA according to doctors' and patients' willingness in a real-world setting. All procedures were performed by experienced endosonographers; cytologists and pathologists were blinded to the sample collection method. Patients were followed for at least 48 weeks, and final diagnoses were obtained after surgery, imaging analysis, or resolution of the lesion. The primary aim was to compare diagnostic yields of EUS-FNA with EUS-FNB for all solid masses, then separately as AIP, NET, mesenchymal tumors, and lymphoma. The secondary endpoint was the quality of the histologic specimen.",

Patients who have not responded to standard treatments will be included, and treatment will last for up to 12 months. The study will assess objective response, progression-free survival, and biomarkers such as PD-L1, ctDNA, and microvesicles, in a multicenter collaborative effort to provide innovative therapeutic options for this underrepresented population",
      "detailed_description": "The ANTARES study is a phase II \"basket\" trial designed to evaluate the tissue-agnostic efficacy of the monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with advanced or metastatic rare tumors. A \"basket\" trial is an innovative type of clinical trial where patients with different types of cancers, but sharing a common molecular feature (in this case, PD-L1 expression), are treated with the same therapy, regardless of the tumor's site of origin. This approach allows for the evaluation of treatments targeting specific molecular characteristics, independent of the primary cancer type.\n\nRare tumors, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), have an incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people per year. Although each rare cancer type is individually uncommon, collectively they account for 25-30% of all malignancies and are often underrepresented in clinical trials due to recruitment challenges and limited funding. As a result, patients with rare cancers generally have a poorer prognosis compared to those with more common tumors.\n\nIn this study, patients with advanced or refractory rare malignancies expressing PD-L1, with a combined positive score (CPS) of ≥10, will be treated with nivolumab. Treatment will be administered until disease progression or for a maximum duration of 12 months, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of this tissue-agnostic immunotherapy approach. Efficacy will be measured according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, with objective response as the primary endpoint. Additionally, the study will assess response biomarkers, including PD-L1, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and microvesicles, to better understand the correlation between biomarker expression and clinical outcomes.\n\nThis multicenter trial, with an estimated duration of four years, will be conducted at Institute of Cancer of the State of São Paulo (ICESP) and other partner institutions. The study aims to overcome existing barriers in rare cancer treatment by offering an innovative approach that explores the potential of personalized therapies based on molecular characteristics, rather than the tumor's primary site",

      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine (NET) tumours have secretory and metabolic pathways not typically found in other cancers that can be utilized for molecular imaging and therapeutic targeting. The most important is somatostatin. Somatostatin receptors are useful tools in the diagnosis and treatment of NET tumours because the somatostatin analogue octreotate can be radiolabeled with lutetium-177 for imaging and therapy.\n\nIn selected populations of patients, radioisotope therapy in expert hands has been shown to be a safe and effective palliative therapy with stable disease, progression free survival benefit, symptom control and improvements in quality of life. Lutetium-177 (DOTA0, Tyr3) octreotate has been used in a significant number of clinical studies shown to be safe and effective as a therapeutic agent in patients with NET tumours. The investigators intend to further confirm these benefits with lutetium-177 octreotate, which could form the basis for a national registry study leading to registration of this therapeutic intervention.",

Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and (iii) rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours).\n\nThe role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.\n\nThis protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of nivolumab \\& ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 2 clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with rare cancers. This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab. If the safety profile is acceptable and clinically efficacy is seen, this study would support the use of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with these cancers.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, they are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. The rare care project has defined a rare malignancy as a cancer with an incidence of less than 6/100000/year. It is estimated that 42,000 people are diagnosed with a form of rare or less common cancer in Australia every year (www.canceraustralia.gov.au). The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of these patients. Given the recent success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a whole range of different cancer types, it can be postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. It is proposed here that patient cohorts which fall within three distinct tumour streams will be examined, with all patients receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy. The three tumour streams are defined as: upper GI malignancies (comprising intra-hepatic/ extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal cancers).); neuroendocrine tumours (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours). Although overall response rates for individual tumour types will not be established due to sample size (target 20 patients per tumour stream, n=60 total), descriptive information of individual patient responses will guide immune-directed therapies to responsive rare tumour types and may be broadened to tumour streams.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Signed Written Informed Consent\n\n   * Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study\n2. Target Population\n\n   * Histologically confirmed Upper GI malignancies (Cholangiocarcinoma/ duodenal carcinoma - collect MSI (microsatellite instability) status); Neuroendocrine tumours (inc. pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and Rare Gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed Mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours).\n   * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 1\n   * Prior systemic therapy is permitted if it was completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrolment, and all related adverse events have either returned to baseline or stabilized or subjects are not suitable for, or if declining established standard therapies.\n   * Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.\n   * Measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria\n   * Tumour tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site of disease must be provided for biomarker analyses. If an insufficient amount of tumour tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site is available prior to the start of the screening phase, subjects must consent to allow the acquisition of additional tumour tissue for performance of biomarker analyses.\n   * Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained within 14 days prior to randomization:\n\n     * WBC (white blood cells) \\> or = to 2000/μL\n     * Neutrophils \\> or = to 1500/μL\n     * Platelets \\> or = to 100 x103/μL\n     * Hemoglobin \\> 9.0 g/dL\n     * Serum creatinine \\< or = to 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) 40 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)\n     * AST/ALT (aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase) \\< or = to 3 x ULN\n     * Total Bilirubin \\< or = to 1.5 x ULN (Upper limit of normal) (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin \\< 3.0 mg/dL).\n   * Subject Re-enrolment: This study permits the re-enrolment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (i.e. subject has not been treated) after obtaining agreement from the medical monitor prior to re enrolling a subject. If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.\n3. Age and Reproductive Status\n\n   * Men and women, \\> or = to 18 years of age\n   * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception. WOCBP should therefore use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for Nivolumab to undergo five half lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.\n   * Women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product.\n   * Women must not be breastfeeding\n   * Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1 percent per year. Men that are sexually active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half lives. The half life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. Given the blinded nature of the study, men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.\n   * Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e. who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile and azoospermic men do not require contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Target Disease Exceptions\n\n   * Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with brain metastases are eligible if these have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI except where contraindicated in which CT scan is acceptable) evidence of progression for at least 8 weeks after treatment is complete and within 28 days prior to first dose of study drug administration. Cases should be discussed with the medical monitor. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.\n2. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases\n\n   * Prior combination treatment directed against the PD-1/PDL1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1) axis (anti PD 1, anti PD-L1, anti PD L2), and anti CTLA 4 antibody. Prior monotherapy with these agents or other immune-stimulating/regulating agents is permitted.\n   * Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.\n   * Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.\n   * Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.\n   * Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement doses \\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n3. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings\n\n   * Any positive test result for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating acute or chronic infection\n   * Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n4. Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction\n\n   * History of allergy to study drug components.\n   * History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.\n5. Sex and Reproductive Status\n\n   * WOCBP who are pregnant or breastfeeding\n   * Women with a positive pregnancy test at enrolment or prior to administration of study medication.\n6.

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without nivolumab works in treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer or cancer that has come back. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy and nivolumab may work better at treating non-small cell lung cancer.",

      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare neoplasms, but with increasing incidence and prevalence in the last decades. Although they may manifest in the most diverse tissues, the vast majority of cases will affect organs of the digestive tract and lung. At diagnosis, more than half of the cases present metastatic disease, and among patients with localized disease, up to one-third will have recurrence of the disease. Unfortunately, the minority of patients with metastatic disease are eligible for curative intent. Although there are many types of NET, they are often studied together as a group because their cells share common histological findings, have special secretory granules, and the ability to secrete bioactive amines and polypeptide hormones. Approximately 25 percent of the tumors present functional hormonal syndromes (situation of great morbidity for these patients), being the carcinoid syndrome, the most common one. From the molecular point of view, these neoplasias are largely dependent on the activation of the mTOR pathway and neoangiogenesis. Another striking feature of neuroendocrine cells is the expression of cell surface hormone receptors whose activation or blockade may exert an important regulatory function. The discovery of somatostatin, and consequently its receptors, is one of the major advances in the treatment of this neoplasm. Due to the increased ability of somatostatin to inhibit the secretion of several hormones, its antitumor property has long been studied. However, only after the development of synthetic long-life formulations can their use be used in clinical practice. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (G1 and G2 according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification) present in more than 80 percent of somatostatin receptor cases. In this population, the use of somatostatin analogues promotes symptomatic improvement of functioning syndromes in the order of 70 to 77 percent and biochemical improvement around 50 percent . Regarding antiproliferative activity, two phase III studies evaluated the role of octreotide LAR and of lanreotide autogel, both somatostatin analogs, in the population of well differentiated tumors and, almost entirely, somatostatin receptor hyperexpressors when evaluated by octreoscan. In these studies, the use of somatostatin analogue was associated with reduced risk of progression or death from 53 percent to 66 percent when compared to placebo. Currently, this class of drugs is often considered as the first treatment option for patients with progressing metastatic disease, when the strategy of watchful waiting is not opted for (because they are tumors of sometimes indolent behavior, some cases are selected for observation only). In general, there are few options for systemic therapies that are approved for these tumors in addition to somatostatin analogs (mTOR and antiangiogenic inhibitors), none of which clearly demonstrate overall survival gain, are costly and none are available for use in the public health system (SUS). Therefore, it is very important to develop studies with new therapies for patients with NET, especially, molecularly defined therapies with greater access to patients. In this context, other anti-hormonal therapies could be explored in patients with NET, such as the role of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, as well as their receptors. A few studies have evaluated the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in NET and suggest interesting results. One of the largest series was conducted at the AC Camargo Cancer Center where the immunohistochemical expression of these receptors was evaluated in 96 patients with NET from various sites. About 35 percent of the cases presented positivity for some hormonal receptor (HR) in the tumor tissue. Among the HR positive cases, there was no difference between sex, more frequent in thin, pancreatic and lung tumors and in well differentiated tumors (G1 and G2 by the WHO). Viale et al. Evaluated the expression of progesterone receptors (PR) in 96 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Nuclear immunoreactivity for PR was observed in 58 percent of cases, with no difference in PR expression according to gender, age, or functioning syndromes. About 163 primary tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic site and 115 metastases were evaluated by Zimmermann and colleagues for expression of female hormone receptors. Progesterone receptor was more frequently found in pancreatic tumors and rarely in non-pancreatic (p \\<0.001), estrogen receptor was more frequently expressed in non-pancreatic tumors (\\<0.001) and in women (p: 0.019). There was no difference between primary site and presence of metastases. Apparently, HR positive tumors may present a more favorable evolution. A study evaluated 160 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors operated for expression by PTEN immunohistochemistry (negative regulator of the mTOR pathway) and PR. Approximately 69 percent of the cases were positive for PR and PTEN, 28 percent were positive for one of the two markers and only 3 percent were negative for both. Combined positivity for PTEN and PR was associated with metastasis-free survival in stages I and II (p \\<0.001) and overall survival in all patients (p \\<0.001), even after adjustment for other prognostic variables. Patients with negative PR and PTEN tumors had the shorter survival times when compared to those who had only one or both markers (p \\<0.001). 9 Similarly, other author demonstrated a retrospective analysis of 277 patients with neuroendocrine tumors (95 percent vs. 76 percent, p \\<0.05), and a higher survival rate (p \\<0.05) than in the control group (p \\<0.05) 0.015). Even rarer in the literature is the role of antiestrogen therapies as a form of control of this neoplasia. Case reports point to antiproliferative activity of tamoxifen in patients with NET and, in some cases, patients presenting more than 12 months of disease control.11 Reports of control of carcinoid syndrome and even regression of associated retroperitoneal fibrosis have also been described. However, the only study to assess the activity of tamoxifen in neuroendocrine tumors dates back to 1984. Sixteen patients were evaluated clinical benefit in only 19 percent of cases and no radiological response. However, in this study, no patient was previously selected for HR tumor expression or degree of differentiation, which the investigators believe limited benefit in disease control. Therefore, based on the premise that there is a need for research and treatment strategies for this rare neoplasm; there is clear therapeutic embezzlement in the public heath system due to the high cost of the treatments approved in the country for this neoplasia; NET are tumors that may present positivity to estrogen and / or progesterone receptors; evidence points to the possibility of antiproliferative effect using hormonal therapy, the investigators propose a phase II study of tamoxifen for patients with well differentiated NET and positive for HR, estrogen and / or progesterone expression.",

This technology allows precise and early cancer to be visualized and measured on whole body images. Patients with Neuro-Endocrine tumors (NETs), require specialized molecular imaging to stage, re-stage and assess eligibility and response to therapy. 68Ga-DOTATATE is a nuclear medicine imaging agent that is not yet approved by Health Canada but used extensively throughout the world. The Ki-67 index, a marker of cell proliferation in NETs, is one of the most important prognostic factors in this disease. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) on PET/CT in NETs inversely correlates with Ki-67 score on initial biopsy. If this hypothesized correlation between SUV and Ki-67 score is reproduced, then DOTATATE would serve as a non-invasive method to assess cellular proliferation and therefore prognosis of these patients.",

The CXCR4 receptor is a marker of poorly differentiated cells. Pentixafor is a peptide that targets these CXCR4 receptors. By combining it with gallium-68, a radionuclide, pentixafor can then be evaluated as an imaging agent to detect high-grade neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n\\[68Ga\\]Pentixafor is a radio-labelled imaging agent used for positron emission tomography (PET). The dose is small, known as a tracer dose. It is designed to capture information about the body and how the body is working without interfering or causing an effect.\n\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate how the \\[68Ga\\]Pentixafor is distributed through the body after injection and how it is taken up by the organs of the body. The study will also examine if the imaging is reproducible to determine if the PET images show the same uptake of the study drug across different scans.\n\nThis study is an RDRC study - the equivalent to a phase 0 study. The \\[68Ga\\]Pentixafor has not been shown to target tumors; specificity and sensitivity have not been established.

      "detailed_description": "When patients are suspected of having neuroendocrine tumours, they will usually undergo various imaging scans such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and octreotide scintigraphy (octreoscan) to try to identify the primary tumour. During the patients' course of disease, they will continue to have various CT, MRI, and/or octreoscans. Sometimes, despite using scans, laboratory tests, and examination, it is still difficult to properly diagnose neuroendocrine tumours.\n\nDoctors have found that most neuroendocrine tumours make too much of a hormone called somatostatin on their cell surface. Because of this doctors have been using positron emission tomography (PET) scans using a special contrast dye called 68Ga-DOTATATE in hopes of better diagnosing and managing neuroendocrine tumours. 68Ga-DOTATATE can label the cells that have somatostatin (such as neuroendocrine tumour cells) so that the PET scan can take better pictures and doctors can better diagnose and manage the disease.\n\nHowever, despite 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans showing promise, it is still not widely accessible. Because of this, researchers are creating a registry for patients who may need 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans to:\n\n* Identify their primary tumour where the doctor suspects is a neuroendocrine tumour\n* Staging of the neuroendocrine tumour\n* Restage the tumour prior to surgery/radiotherapy or help to assess the tumour where standard scans such as CTs, MRIs, or octreoscans are not properly showing your tumours despite other clinical or laboratory tests showing that your disease has progressed\n* For other issues when confirmation of site of disease and/or disease extent may impact clinical management of the neuroendocrine tumour.\n\nThis registry help the participant's treating physician to obtain approval for the participant to undergo 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans for their neuroendocrine tumour.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Able to undergo PET/CT without sedation\n* Any of the following indications:\n\n  * Group A. Identification of primary tumor: For the initial diagnosis of patients with clinical (e.g., signs, symptoms) and/or biochemical (e.g., tumor markers) suspicion of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) but for whom conventional imaging is negative or equivocal or for whom biopsy is not easily obtained.\n  * Group B. Staging: For the staging of patients with localized primary NETs and/or limited metastasis where definitive surgery is planned.\n  * Group C. Restaging: Restaging of patients with NET where surgery or peptide-receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) is being considered; OR, where conventional imaging is negative or equivocal at time of clinical and/or biochemical progression.\n  * Group D. As a problem-solving tool: As a problem-solving tool in patient with NET when confirmation of site of disease and/or disease extent may impact clinical management.\n* Approved by a review panel if Group D.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability to provide informed consent.\n* Contraindication for PET examination as per institutional safety guidelines, including but not limited to pregnancy, or inability to lie still for PET examination.\n* Need for full sedation to undergo PET/CT scan.",

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinomas account for 10-15 % of all pancreatic incidentalomas. The management of pancreatic NETs depends on tumor stage and on presence or not of hormonal syndrome. The therapeutic approach for hormonally functional tumor, or large tumor (\\> 2 cm) with local, vascular or lymph nodes invasion, highly suggestive of malignancy, or in presence of metastasis, is well admitted: surgery is indicated or should be discussed. However, the attitude is less consensual for small (≤ 2 cm) non-functioning (NF) and non-metastatic lesions. In English, American or French recommendations, systematic surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is currently recommended in all medically fit patients. The follow-up (FU) is possible for tumors \\<2 cm (T1) located in the pancreatic head and for which enucleation is not feasible. Several recently published retrospective studies discuss the \"non- surgical\" management of the small NF incidentally detected pancreatic NETs (IPNETs) and highlight the necessity of developing guidelines for management of these patients. A strict correlation between tumor size and malignancy of these tumors was demonstrated in the single-center retrospective Italian study of Bettini and col., which included all patients with NF PNETs who underwent curative (R0) resection during 18 years. In the group of 51 patients with small size of T (2 cm or less), incidentally discovered, the majority of lesion was benign, and the authors concluded that follow-up can be proposed in patients with incidentally discovered NF PNETs ≤ 2 cm. However in despite of small size and asymptomatic character of the tumor, the rate of malignancy of NF IPNETs ≤ 2 cm was estimated to be 24 % (in 18% and 6% of cases, uncertain behaviour and carcinoma were present). Given the inherent morbidities associated with pancreatic surgery, a risk-benefit calculation may favour surveillance rather than surgery in highly selected patients. Thus, a better understanding of NF IPNETs and identification of their prognostic factors can be of help to select a subgroup of patients who could benefit from a long-term surveillance rather than a systematic surgical resection. Clearly, large prospective trials are needed to validate this approach.",
      "detailed_description": "With increasing use of high-resolution conventional imaging, pancreatic incidentalomas are being diagnosed more frequently. In two recent surgical series, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinomas account for 10-15 % of all pancreatic incidentalomas, the majority ( 75-90 % of cases) well differentiated. The factors affecting the behaviour of pancreatic NETs are differentiation, histological grade, staging, size and intratumoral microvascular density. In updated World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the grading system is based on tumor differentiation, the rate of proliferation and Ki-67 index. The management of pancreatic NETs depends on tumor stage and on presence or not of hormonal syndrome. By definition, the incidentally discovered pancreatic NETs (PNETs) are unassociated with hormonal syndromes (nonfunctioning) and detected in patients who undergo diagnostic evaluations for unrelated conditions.\n\nThe therapeutic approach for hormonally functional tumor, or large tumor (\\> 2 cm) with local, vascular or lymph nodes invasion, highly suggestive of malignancy, or in presence of metastasis, is well admitted: surgery is indicated or should be discussed.\n\nHowever, the attitude is less consensual for small (≤ 2 cm) non-functioning (NF) and non-metastatic lesions. There is a paucity of literature reporting pancreatic neuroendocrine incidentalomas and their characteristics. However, given their increased incidence, they are an emerging problem and require changes in treatment guidelines. In English, American or French recommendations, systematic surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is currently recommended in all medically fit patients. The follow-up (FU) is possible for tumors \\<2 cm (T1) located in the pancreatic head and for which enucleation is not feasible. This therapeutic approach has two limitations: 1) the significant incidence of these tumors, because of the widespread use of routine imaging, and the improved technology of multi detector CT scan, the fortuitous discovery of small pancreatic incidentalomas is becoming more common. 2) Pancreatic surgery carries significant postoperative morbidity even in high-volume tertiary centers and even in parenchyma-preserving resection. This may results in many pancreatic resections for tumors with unknown natural history. On the other hand, the follow-up may be a factor of considerable anxiety, and carries the risk, actually difficult to assess, to let the tumor grow between two monitoring controls, with the possible evolution to the irreversible metastatic stage of the disease.\n\nAs a result, the investigators are unceasingly facing a dilemma: how to manage asymptomatic patients with small incidentally detected, potentially benign NETs? Several recently published retrospective studies discuss the \"non- surgical\" management of the small NF incidentally detected pancreatic NETs (IPNETs) and highlight the necessity of developing guidelines for management of these patients. A strict correlation between tumor size and malignancy of these tumors was demonstrated in the single-center retrospective Italian study of Bettini and col. , which included all patients with NF PNETs who underwent curative (R0) resection during 18 years. In the group of 51 patients with small size of T (2 cm or less), incidentally discovered, the majority of lesion was benign, and the authors concluded that follow-up can be proposed in patients with incidentally discovered NF PNETs ≤ 2 cm.

This improvement in the absorption will be assessed in part by evaluating changes in average daily stool frequency from baseline in patients receiving Enterade®. Each subject serves as his or her own control.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To assess subject reported health-related quality of life in subjects before and after compound administration.\n* To characterize the side effect profile and tolerability of Enterade® as measured by the number of total 8-oz Enterade® bottles consumed throughout the trial, and average drinks per day.\n* To evaluate changes in serum electrolytes before and after administration of Eenterade®.\n* To assess intravenous fluid requirement and/or hospitalization for dehydration secondary to diarrhea between control observation period and active Enterade® period.\n* To evaluate difference in utilization of standard-of-care anti-diarrheal medications between control observation period and Enterade® period.\n* To compare subjective feeling of bloating and flatulence before and after administration of Enterade®.\n* To evaluate changes in patient weight before and after administration of Enterade®.",

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms originating from neuroendocrine cells located throughout the body. They secret various peptides and cause various symptoms (carcinoid syndrome) or not. The incidence of NETs was not well-known till recently when Yao et al. and Hausa et al. published their surveys of NETs using data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and from the Norwegian Registry of Cancer (NRC). The incidence of NETs in Taiwan by using the Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) data was increased from 0.3 to 1.51 per 100,000 from 1996 to 2008. The increased incidence for NET worldwide probably was partially due to the awareness and improvement of diagnostic technology. Compared with the incidence in western countries, the incidence of NET is much lower in Taiwan. And the incidence of NETs in Asian Pacific Islanders was also lower than the whites and blacks in US. Gastroenteral-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs), accounting for half to two thirds of all NETs, is the most common site of NETs. As the progress in the understanding of pathophysiology for GEP-NET, there are two novel targeted agents shown to be effective for the treatment of GEP-NET. Meanwhile, response to mTOR inhibitor was better for Asian than Caucasian in the phase III study using everolimus for advanced pancreatic NETs. These information suggests that there is racial difference for either genetic or environmental risk factors and these factors result in different incidence and/or clinical outcome. Currently, there is limited data for thorough epidemiologic study in Taiwan. The aim of this study is to collect clinical information for GEP-NET, and survey the prognostic factors for GEP-NET in Taiwan. the investigators suppose that this epidemiologic study would provide a database potentially to improve the diagnosis, and treatment of GEP-NET. This study plans to include 600 GEP-NET patients. NET patients diagnosed after 2011.1.1 is included in this study.\n\nFurthermore, the investigators will provide the check of immunohistochemical staining for the tumor tissue of GEP-NET patients, including the functioning status (insulinoma, glucagonoma, gastrinoma, VIPoma) and the degree of differentiation, the expression of SSTR2 or SSTR5 and the check of possible primary site for unknown primary NET patients. This examination will provide more accurate diagnosis for the patients and further treatment suggestion for the patients.",

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine cancer.",

To evaluate the efficacy (using response rate per RECIST v1.1) of nivolumab and temozolomide for the treatment of patients with either small cell lung cancer that have progressed or recurred after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy (cohort 1), or progressive metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of any grade or primary site in any line of therapy (cohort 2).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety profile and toxicity of combination nivolumab and temozolomide as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5.0.\n\nII. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with combination nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIII. To evaluate the central nervous system (CNS) PFS of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether treatment with nivolumab and temozolomide leads to a decrease in immune-suppressive cell populations (ie myeloid-derived suppressor cells \\[MDSC\\]) in peripheral blood.\n\nII. To determine whether objective response rate (ORR), PFS, OS vary by tumor O6-methylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation at baseline.\n\nIII. To determine whether baseline tumor mutational burden is predictive of response to therapy in patients with SCLC treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIV. To determine whether changes in blood based mutation burden during treatment may predict clinical benefit.\n\nV. To determine whether a composite immune and tumor cell staining score can be developed with or without PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to predict response in the SCLC cohort.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of a 28 day cycle. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for 12 months, then every 12 weeks thereafter.",

Compared to healthy cells, the surface of these tumor cells has a greater number of special molecules called somatostatin receptors (SSTR). Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and conventional imaging are used to detect NETs.\n\nThis study proposes 68Gallium(68Ga)-DOTATOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is superior to current imaging techniques. The goal is to evaluate the safety and sensitivity of 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT at detecting NETs and other tumors with over-expression of somatostatin receptors.",

The 68Ga-DOTATOC radioactive tracer is manufactured for this study under a Clinical Trial Application filed with Health Canada. 18F-FDG is considered standard care and has been approved by Health Canada.\n\nAfter providing informed written consent subjects will complete a medical history questionnaire.\n\nMonitoring of adverse events There will be short-term evaluation of adverse events by comparison of vital signs before and after administration of 68Ga-DOTATOC. Twenty-four hours after 68Ga-DOTATOC administration the study coordinator will call the patient and see if they have experienced any adverse events during that time period and complete the adverse event questionnaire found in section 9.6.\n\nFollow-up Assessments\n\nThe following information will be collected up to 3 years following the PET/CT scans:\n\n* Initiation of a new treatment\n* Laboratory results and pathology reports\n* Results of imaging studies\n* Final clinical diagnosis by physician and relevant clinical notes\n\nThe study is expected to take approximately 4 years for accrual.",

      "brief_summary": "Urinary measure of 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5HIAA) is an important marker for the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors. Although this marker has good specificity, its sensitivity is moderate and its dosage is constraining, since it requires urine collection over 2-3 days and specific diet. Preliminary data suggested that overnight 5HIAA value may be representative of 24-hour 5HIAA value, and that plasma 5HIAA dosage could be a valuable alternative to urine 5HIAA dosage. The main objective of this study is to compare sensitivity and specificity of overnight 5HIAA value, 24-hour 5HIAA value and plasma 5HIAA value, in patients with small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors.",
      "detailed_description": "This study primarily aims at comparing the sensitivity and specificity of overnight 5HIAA value, 24-hour 5HIAA value and plasma 5HIAA value, in patients with small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors. Secondary objectives include the correlation of 5HIAA values with chromogranin A, carcinoid syndrome and tumor burden and the evaluation of the compliance to the diet and its correlation with 5HIAA values.\n\nThe study group will include patients with proven neuroendocrine tumors of various stages and functioning syndrome profile. A control group will be constituted with subjects having irritable bowel syndrome, in which a neuroendocrine tumor is ruled out. After providing informed consent, patients fitting with inclusion criteria will be included in the study. Patients will have to follow a specific diet, and interrupt/avoid certain medication, during the 2 days before and the 2 days during the sampling period. Whole urine samples will be collected during 2 consecutive days, in 4 parts (day1, night 1, day 2, night 2). Blood samples will be collected at the morning of days 2 and 3. Observance with diet and drug restriction will be evaluated at the morning of day 3.",

These tumors arise from special cells called neuroendocrine cells, which are found in these organs and release hormones to regulate various bodily functions. GEP-NETs can be slow-growing, and symptoms may vary depending on their location and size.\n\nAcromegaly is a condition where a person's body produces too much growth hormone. This excess hormone can cause certain body parts, like the hands, feet, and face, to enlarge over time. It typically occurs because of a tumor on the pituitary gland in the brain, which is responsible for regulating hormones. Acromegaly can lead to various health issues if not treated, but medications or surgery can often help manage the condition.\n\nLong-acting somatostatin analogs (LA-SSAs) are indicated for patients with Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and acromegaly who are not eligible for surgery or when surgery fails to achieve remission.\n\nData for this study will be collected after the treatment switch from the Ipsen lanreotide syringe to the Pharmathen lanreotide syringe has occurred, using one round of one-to-one qualitative telephone and/or videoconference interviews with patients. Interviews will last 45 minutes and be carried out in the local language of the participant's country.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to capture the patient experience of the Ipsen lanreotide syringe and their experience with the Pharmathen lanreotide syringe.",

      "brief_summary": "This study is designed to identify the best tolerated doses of \\[131\\]Iodine-MIBG and \\[90\\]Yttrium-DOTATOC when co-administered to treat midgut neuroendocrine tumors. These drugs (131I-MIBG, 90Y-DOTATOC) are radioactive drugs, known as radionuclide therapy. Currently, the safest and best tolerated doses of these drugs (when combined together) is unknown.",
      "detailed_description": "\\[131\\]Iodine-MIBG and \\[90\\]Yttrium-DOTATOC are radioactive drugs designed to treat specific tumor cells. These drugs are a combination of the radiation (131-Iodine, 90-Yttrium) and a protein that targets the tumor cell (MIBG or DOTATOC). Because these proteins are attracted to, and stick to, the tumor, the radiation is centered in the tumors. This kills more tumor cells and minimizes radiation-damage to healthy tissues, like the heart and lungs.\n\nTwo organs still absorb some of the radiation, though: bone marrow and the kidney. These organs limit how much radiation can be given to tumors, but we don't know how much radiation is too much. Too much radiation to bone marrow can result in anemia. Too much radiation to the kidneys can result in kidney failure. From prior radiation therapies, we have a general idea of how much radiation we can give safely.\n\n131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC have never been given together. We want to give them together because many times, tumors are actually groups of different types of cells. This means, not all the cells respond to therapy the same way. If some tumor cells survive therapy, the tumor will continue to grow and eventually come back. We know some mid-gut neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have targets for DOTATOC and some other mid-gut NETs have targets for MIBG. We also have now identified that some people with mid-gut NETs have different tumors: some with targets for MIBG and some with targets for DOTATOC. For these people, this means treating only with 131I-MIBG or 90Y-DOTATOC will not be enough to treat their cancer. They need both radioactive drugs.\n\nBecause we are combining these radioactive drugs, this study is known as a first-in-man study. We are also using a special imaging to help us estimate the radiation dose to the bone marrow and to the kidneys. This is what decides the final dose of 131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC.\n\nBefore receiving therapy, participants will be asked to undergo imaging to verify they have both MIBG and DOTATOC tumor types:\n\n* participants are given very small doses of radioactive drugs\n* a special camera (SPECT/CT) collects images (scans)\n* imaging (scans) are done over 3 calendar days\n* blood samples are taken at that time, too, to measure the circulating amount of tracer doses\n\nIf the scans show a participant has both MIBG and DOTATOC tumors, therapy is given:\n\n* a customized dose of 90Y-DOTATOC is given on day 1 of a treatment cycle. This is given outpatient.\n* a customized dose of 131I-MIBG is given on day 2 of a treatment cycle. This is given inpatient (admitted to the hospital).\n* participants are monitored through blood tests to identify the side effects of therapy.\n\nEach participant can have up to 2 cycles of therapy. The cycles are 12 weeks apart.\n\nThe doses for 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I-MIBG are decided based on radiation to the bone marrow and radiation to the kidney. Doses are decided by how well other participants have done on this study.\n\nParticipants have life long follow-up for this study. This is very important, because a study like this has not been done.",

      "brief_summary": "Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) are a sub-group of aggressive neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN). The most common primary sites are broncho-pulmonary and digestive. The gastroentero-pancreatic NECs (GEP-NEC) represent 7-21% of all of the NENs.\n\nRecent data on the initial presentation of GEP-NEC have been reported in two retrospective studies and a French cohort study. No standard second-line treatment has been defined for NECs. Despite a very negative prognosis, these NECs have a certain amount of chemosensitivity, close to that of bronchial NECs. Multiple-drug therapies such as Folfiri, or Folfox, or single drug treatments such as temozolomide are the proposed options but with a low level of proof Bevacizumab associated with a cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown promising results in well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET), known for being hypervascular. The efficacy of bevacizumab has also been suggested in patients with NEC, but never in the context of a phase II study. Its combination with Folfiri is efficient and well tolerated in metastatic colorectal cancer. The combination Folfiri-bevacizumab potentially represents an optimized treatment compared to chemotherapy with only Folfiri. No phase II or III studies have reported results for these patients, and no on-going phase II or III trial have been identified to date.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to show that, after the failure of a first-line chemotherapy using platinum-etoposide, the combination Folfiri-bevacizumab allows significant prolongation of overall survival in adult patients with GEP-NEC.",

These tumors have a high lymph node and distant metastatic potential (hepatic, pulmonary, etc.). Their management is essentially surgical and the extent of the resection essentially depends on preoperative data from conventional and isotopic imaging.\n\nThe goal of surgical resection is to remove the portion of the small intestine carrying the tumour(s) with healthy margins (so-called R0 resection) and affected lymph nodes in the mesentery (lymph node dissection). The extent of lymph node dissection, sometimes significant, exposes you to the risk of short hail with its own complications (malnutrition, diarrhoea, etc.). Consequently, an analysis of the benefits and risks between the interest of an extensive and oncological resection (R0) and the risks of short bowel must be carried out for each patient.\n\nThe reference examination to define lymph node involvement is determined by the histological examination of the resected surgical specimen (reference examination). The preoperative evaluation of lymph node extension is done by preoperative abdominal CT scan. However, the preoperative CT scan is not always consistent (sensitivity and specificity) with the pathology data (reference examination). For about 5 years, isotopic imaging (DOPA-PET and DOTATOC) has become feasible and could improve the quality of preoperative evaluation of lymph node extension. Consequently, the aim of this study is to determine the contribution of isotopic imaging (DOPA-PET and DOTATOC) in the preoperative evaluation of lymph node extension.",

In GEP-NETs the actual surgical planning is established on the ground of preoperative morphology images (CT scan), and functional imaging using CT/PET with 68Ga-DOTA-TOC, since the high expression of somatostatin receptors (SSR) of these tumors. RGS in GEP-NETs, mainly with gamma-probes, has been not widely accepted since the low rates of sensitivity and, in particular, specificity, in discriminating tumoral/ non tumoral tissue and background ratio. This is a relevant issue in particular in detecting metastatic lymph-nodes both for small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Pan-NETs), where the presence of lymph-node metastases has been associated with worse long-term outcome. At present, it is not possible to distinguish whether a small lymph-node is site of metastases or not without performing frozen sections. In a previous study ex-vivo from European Institute of Oncology SI-NET presented a high uptake of a beta-emitting radiotracer, 90Y-DOTA-TOC. Five SI-NET showing SSR positivity at PET with 68Ga DOTA-TOC received 5 mCi of 90Y-DOTA-TOC the day before surgery. All the tumor samples showed high counts of radioactivity with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 100%. These results allowed the investigators to develop a probe, which is now approved for in-vivo employment within the operating theatre. The objective of the present study is to verify in-vivo within the abdominal cavity the capability of the probe to detect 68-Ga activity within tumoral tissue thus favouring radical surgery and avoiding unnecessary demolition, in the near future. However, in the present protocol the entity of surgery will not be modified by intraoperative findings of the probe. It is reasonable to assume that results from 68Ga-DOTA-TOC might be comparable to 90Y-DOTA-TOC as radiotracer, and the detection efficacy of the probe for 68Ga could be not inferior compared to the isotope 90Y. However, while 90Y-DOTA-TOC is used as investigational drug for therapy purposes only within clinical research protocol, 68Ga-DOTA-TOC is a diagnostic radiotracer broadly used in day-to-day clinical practice since many years. Furthermore, the administration of 68Ga-DOTA-TOC can be directly injected in surgery room and thus does not require patients' admission the day before surgery.",

In gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), it provides good long-term outcome and low recurrence rates.
