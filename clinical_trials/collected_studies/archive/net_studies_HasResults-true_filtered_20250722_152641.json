      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to learn if a new drug, ONC201 can make tumors become smaller or go away completely. Investigators also want to learn if ONC201 can prevent new deposits of cancer from appearing in new places in participants (metastases). A phase 2 study of ONC201 in PC-PG (pheochromocytoma-paraganglioma) and other neuroendocrine tumors will determine whether inhibition of DRD2 (a member of the dopamine receptor family) is safe in unresectable, recurrent, locally advanced, refractory, or metastatic neuroendocrine cancers including PC-PG, desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT), Ewing sarcoma (PNET) or any other neuroendicrine tumor with a catecholamine or dopamine biomarker or autocrine or paracrine dependence on dopamine including cholangiocarcinoma and adrenal cortical carcinoma.\n\nONC201 is an investigational (experimental) agent and has a favorable safety profile in phase 1 and early phase 2 clinical trials in advanced cancers. This study design has been chosen to see whether ONC201 is associated with reduction of anti-hypertension medications, safety and significant efficacy against neuroendocrine tumors, especially PC-PG.",
      "detailed_description": "Primary Objective To demonstrate objective responses using MRI or CT, and/or PET-CT imaging. The same CT or MRI imaging to assess disease burden at study entry will be compared at week 6 and 3 months. Patients without progression at 3 months will continue treatment and have imaging at 6, 9 and 12 months after study entry. Metabolic response and/or biomarkers will be compared with study entry PET-CT and scans at 6 weeks, 3 months and 12 months.\n\nSecondary Objectives Progression - free Survival: This will be calculated according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) or development of new disease\n\nOverall survival: Overall survival will be determined by email or telephone contact.\n\nStudy Design: Phase 2 open-label fixed dose study Metastatic neuroendocrine tumors including PC-PG are rare diseases.\n\nThe current recommended phase II dose of 625 mg orally on 2 consecutive days every week will be used. The same imaging at study entry will be used at subsequent time points (CT or MRI for week 6 and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) Imaging modality choice will be influenced by the quality of prior scans of the subject and will be ordered so clinical comparison is possible.\n\nBecause of travel and lodging considerations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, some information by the study team/PI may be obtained using virtual visits and 2nd read of scans sent to Cleveland Clinic",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without cediranib works in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib and cediranib may help treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",

To characterize genomic alterations by whole exome sequencing in mCRPC patients and correlate that with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nII. To characterize changes in ribonucleic acid (RNA) expression of DNA repair genes, angiogenesis markers, and immune markers, by whole transcriptome sequencing and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIII. To characterize changes in immune tumor microenvironment in mCRPC patients by profiling expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and correlate with clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib.\n\nIV. To identify baseline predictive biomarkers for rPFS or response and to identify on-treatment markers of acquired resistance in men with mCRPC receiving either olaparib plus cediranib or olaparib alone.\n\nV. To explore biomarker signatures that correlate with the clinical activity or resistance to olaparib with or without cediranib, including changes in gene expression or acquired mutations in tumor biopsies.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM A: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and cediranib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-28.
