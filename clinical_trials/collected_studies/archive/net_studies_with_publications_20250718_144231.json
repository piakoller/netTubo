      "brief_summary": "PRECISION-NEC is a single-center, open-label, pilot feasibility study of molecularly defined subtypes of metastatic high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (HG-NEC). The hypothesis is that HG-NEC (excluding small cell carcinoma) can be segregated based on mutational analysis and that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assignment of therapy is feasible and will potentially improve the outcomes.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nThere is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.\n\nLCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015 World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.\n\nLCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.\n\nBased on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).\n\nSimilarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.\n\nTreatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent, driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently defined a new subtype of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in large-cell carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example.\n\nTo date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapies for metastatic HG-NECs, based on mutational profiles. This study will utilize recent genomic profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of optimal treatments.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase III trial studies cabozantinib to see how well it works compared with placebo in treating patients with neuroendocrine or carcinoid tumors that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Cabozantinib is a chemotherapy drug known as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and it targets specific tyrosine kinase receptors, that when blocked, may slow tumor growth.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether cabozantinib (cabozantinib S-malate) can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nII. To determine whether cabozantinib can significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nIII. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE).\n\nIV. To evaluate safety and tolerability of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors using CTCAE and PRO-CTCAE.\n\nV. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced pancreatic NET whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nVI. To evaluate the overall radiographic response rate of cabozantinib versus placebo in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors whose disease has progressed after prior therapy.\n\nOTHER OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. Results of the primary analysis will be examined for consistency, while taking into account the stratification factors and/or covariates of baseline quality of life (QOL) and fatigue.\n\nQUALITY OF LIFE SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To compare overall quality of life, disease-related symptoms, and other domains between the two treatment groups (cabozantinib versus \\[vs.\\] placebo) within each cohort of patients (pancreatic NET vs. carcinoid tumor). (Quality of Life Substudy Objective - A021602-HO1)\n\nPOPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS SUBSTUDY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To describe the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response relationships of cabozantinib in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors. (Population Pharmacokinetics Substudy Objective - A021602-PP1)\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study.\n\nARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo blood and urine sample collection, and CT, MRI, and/or x-ray imaging during screening and on study. Patients may crossover to receive cabozantinib S-malate at the time of disease progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks until disease progression or start of new anticancer therapy, and then every 6 months until 8 years after registration.",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without cediranib works in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib and cediranib may help treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",

Researchers think that treatment with drugs based on knowing the defective gene might give better results.\n\nObjective:\n\n- To see if drugs selected based on the defective gene result in better tumor response. The drugs are Sunitinib and Everolimus.\n\nEligibility:\n\n- People age 18 and older with an advanced low- or intermediate-grade gastrointestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor.\n\nDesign:\n\n* Participants will be screened with:\n* Medical history\n* Physical exam\n* Scans\n* Blood, urine, and lab tests\n* The study team will see if participants should have surgery.\n* If yes, participants will:\n* Sign a separate consent\n* Have computed tomography (CT) scan before and after surgery\n* Have as much of the tumor removed as possible. A small piece will be tested for mutation type.\n* If no, participants will have a small piece of tumor removed for the testing.\n* If the surgery might cure them, the participant will leave the study. The other participants will be assigned to take either Sunitinib or Everolimus.\n* Participants will take their drug by mouth once a day. They will keep a medicine diary. Some will keep track of their blood pressure at least weekly.\n* Screening tests may be repeated at study visits. Participants also may have their heart evaluated.\n* About 30 days after the last day of their study drug, participants will have a follow-up visit that repeats the screening tests.\n* Participants will be contacted every 3 months after this visit.",
      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\n* Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas are a rare and heterogeneous group of neoplasms with unique tumor biology, natural history, and clinical management issues.\n* Most NETs are sporadic, but they can be part of familial cancer syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.\n* Well-differentiated, low or intermediate grade NETs have a heterogeneous natural history.\n* Surgery is the only curative treatment option in patients with localized early stage NETs.\n* The optimal management strategy for patients with advanced NETs is unknown.\n* The majority of NETs have somatic mutations in MEN1 and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B), and genes involved in the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and/or overexpression of growth factors and their receptors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR) that can be targeted for therapy.\n* Survival in patients with NETs and somatic mutations is better than patients with wild type NETs.\n* Sunitinib (multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and Everolimus (mTOR signaling pathway inhibitor) are currently approved for the treatment of progressive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic NETs.\n* However, mutation targeted therapy with Sunitinib or Everolimus has not been studied in this patient population.\n* The present proposal aims to determine if mutation targeting therapy for patients with advanced low- or intermediate grade NETs is more effective than historically expected results.\n\nObjectives:\n\n-To determine the progression-free survival in patients with NETs of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas treated with Sunitinib or Everolimus based on tumor genotyping.\n\nEligibility:\n\n-Patients with:\n\n* progressive, histologically or cytologically diagnosed low or intermediate grade locally advanced or metastatic NETs.\n* Age greater than or equal to 18 years\n\nDesign:\n\n* Phase II open labeled clinical trial.\n* Tumor biopsy for tumor genotyping will be performed if the patient does not have archival tissue available and does not have MEN1, VHL or NF1.\n* Patients with somatic or germline mutations in MEN1/PDGFR/KIT/FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 will be treated with Sunitinib. (Arm 1)\n* Patients with somatic/germline mutations in NF1/PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/VHL will be treated with Everolimus. (Arm 2)\n* Patients with wildtype tumor will be treated with Sunitinib. (Arm 1)\n* Patients who have disease-progression on either Sunitinib or Everolimus will cross-over to the other drug.\n* Treatment will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.\n* Up to 120 patients will be accrued to the study.

      "intervention": "Ziv-aflibercept",
      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and schedule.\n\nYou will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each cycle is 28 days.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle: questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).\n\nUrine tests will be performed every other cycle.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.\n\nAfter the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed: questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test, EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.",

      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic, high grade NET (Ki67 \\>20%), excluding any high grade NETs of large or small cell type of lung/thymus origin and merkel cell carcinoma\n2. Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension in accordance with RECIST criteria v. 1.1 as described in detail in section 12.0\n3. Has received prior therapy with at least 1 platinum-containing regimen\n4. Age \\> 18 years.\n5. ECOG performance status 0 or 1\n6. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function\n7. Female participants of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication). They should also be willing to use 2 methods of birth control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication. Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\n8. Male participants must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of study therapy through 120 days after the last dose of study therapy Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.\n9. Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent and HIPAA consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability.\n2. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.\n3. Diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.\n4. Prior anti-cancer therapy with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or not recovered from adverse events (improved to grade 1 or less) due to mAbs administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n5. Prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy within 2 weeks (12 weeks for measurable sites of CNS disease) prior to study Day 1 or not recovered from adverse events (improved to grade 1 or less) due to a previously administered agent. Note: Subjects with neuropathy or ≤ Grade 2 alopecia are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.\n6. Known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment except superficial malignancies of the skin and in situ cervical cancer\n7. Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\n8. Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of interstitial lung disease or active non-infectious pneumonitis.\n9. Active infection requiring systemic therapy at enrollment.\n10. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)\n11. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients\n12. Has received a live virus vaccine within 30 days of planned start of trial treatment.\n13. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening period through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment\n14. Prior therapy with an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand (PDL-1), anti-PD-L2, or with an agent directed to another co-inhibitory T-cell receptor (e.g. CTLA-4, OX-40, CD137)\n15. Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n16. Known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA \\[qualitative\\]).\n17. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation with the requirements of the trial\n18. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.",
