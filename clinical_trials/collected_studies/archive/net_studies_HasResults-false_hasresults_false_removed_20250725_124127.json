      "brief_summary": "Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) is based on specific somatostatin receptor targeting with radiolabelled analogues 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE. These two most commonly used radiopeptides, 90Y-DOTATOC and 177Lu-DOTATATE, produce overall objective response rates of 15-35%. PRRT is generally well tolerated with mild toxicity, if the necessary precautions, such as the co-administration of nephroprotective amino acids or the adjustment of the administered activity, are taken.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by surgical resection for resectable non-functioning PanNETs at high risk of recurrence.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the Rate of postoperative 90-day morbidity and mortality after neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by pancreatic resection and the secondary endpoints are:\n\n1. Rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for primary lesions' assessment, and modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), for liver metastases' assessment, if detected\n2. Quality of life (QoL) after neoadjuvant PRRT followed by pancreatic surgical resection.\n\nThe study is designed as a prospective phase II single-arm trial. 8 Italian centers will participate to the study (6 surgical sites, 2 nuclear medicine sites).\n\nPatients will be recruited for 12 months. The study will end 2 months after operation of the last patient enrolled and the total duration of the study will be 24 months.\n\nSample size estimation: 30 patients",
      "detailed_description": "Rationale:\n\nIn a recent study un initial experience was reported with neoadjuvant PRRT followed by surgical resection in patients affected by PanNETs. In this study, patients with resectable or potentially resectable PanNETs at high risk of recurrence after surgery who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT were compared with a group of patients who underwent upfront surgery. Of note, patients who underwent neoadjuvant PRRT had a significant lower risk of developing pancreatic fistula and a lower risk of postoperative complications. Moreover, among those patients who underwent curative resection, patients who received PRRT had a progression-free survival significantly longer after compared to upfront surgery. Neoadjuvant PRRT may be a valuable option to reduce the risk of failure after surgery in patients with PanNETs who are at high risk of recurrence. Nevertheless, the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT has never been investigated in a prospective trial.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and the efficacy of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by surgical resection for resectable non-functioning PanNETs at high risk of recurrence.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the Rate of postoperative 90-day morbidity and mortality after neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE followed by pancreatic resection and the secondary endpoints are:\n\n1. Rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for primary lesions' assessment, and modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), for liver metastases' assessment, if detected.\n2. Quality of life (QoL) after neoadjuvant PRRT followed by pancreatic surgical resection.\n\nThe study is designed as a prospective phase II single-arm trial. 8 Italian centers will participate to the study (6 surgical sites, 2 nuclear medicine sites).\n\nPatients will be recruited for 12 months. The study will end 2 months after operation of the last patient enrolled and the total duration of the study will be 24 months.\n\nSample size:\n\nBy using the Single-Stage Phase II sample size method, we estimated a sample size of 30 patients to test if the proportion of patients without postoperative complications (responses) is more than or equal to 57% (p1 ) or less than equal to 39% (p0 ).\n\nTo be enrol in the study, all the patients should have a cytological/histological confirmation of PanNET and meet one or more inclusion criteria. Moreover, all the exclusion criteria should have been ruled out.\n\nPatients will undergo the following laboratory examinations at week 0, week 1, week 9, week 17, week 25, week 38, week 40, week 45-52: blood cell count, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, cloride, calcium, glucose, bilirubin, AST, ALT, LDH, GGT, ALP, Albumin, urine test. Gravindex will be executed at week 0, week 1, week 9, week 17, week 25, week 40 and they will be asked to fill a quality of life questionnaire at wwk 0, week 38, week 40-52.\n\nEnrolled patients will be treated with standard pancreatic resection according to PanNET localization, after a course (4 cycles) of neoadjuvant PRRT with 177Lu-DOTATATE.\n\nPatients will receive a cumulative activity of 29.600 MBq (800 mCi), divided in 4 administrations (or cycles) of 7.400 MBq (200 mCi) each, with treatment intervals of 6-8 weeks. The per-cycle activity of 177Lu-DOTATATE (and consequently the cumulative activity) might be reduced if relevant blood and renal toxicity, or other side effects, will occur during the course of PRRT.\n\n177Lu-DOTATATE will be slowly injected intravenously over a period of 30 minutes and using a dedicated pump-system of infusion.\n\nDuring the administration of the therapy, performed into a dedicated room of the Nuclear Medicine Division, the Health Physics staff will monitor the patient by means of an ionization chamber, in order to check the completeness of the radiopeptide administration.\n\nIn order to obtain an adequate hydration of the patient and to protect the renal parenchyma during the phase of excretion of the radiopharmaceutical from an excessive tubular reuptake of radiopetide, the administration of the radiopharmaceutical will be preceded and followed (without interruption) with intravenous infusion of 1000 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride solution containing L-Arginine hydrochloride and/or Lysine.\n\nThe gamma emission of 177Lu (113 and 208 KeV, relative abundance 6 and 11%, respectively) allows a suitable observation of the radiopharmaceutical biodistribution during the entire therapeutic phase.\n\nAfter 16-24 hours from administration of 177Lu-DOTATATE (and for each treatment cycle) patients will undergo anterior and posterior whole body scan (imaging will be acquired on a 128x512 matrix, by means a double-headed gamma-camera, equipped with a low-energy high-resolution collimator (LEHR), with energetic window set on 177Lu peaks.) in order to verify the correct bio-distribution of the radiopharmaceutical and its focal uptake into the target lesions.\n\nMoreover, at 1st and 4th cycle, when feasible and indicated, a more accurate imaging evaluation will be performed by using SPECT or SPECT/CT imaging (6-24 hours after administration), in order to quantify percentage of radiopharmaceutical uptake and half-life, absorbed dose, effective biological dose (BED), equivalent uniform dose (EUD) both in target lesions and critical organs (bone marrow and kidney) and correlate these parameters with the response to the treatment) and with the toxicity profile.\n\nAll patients will be re-evaluated 3 months after the 4th cycle of PRRT, in order to assess the rate of objective radiological response, according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1).\n\nPatients will undergo standard pancreatic surgery plus lymphadenectomy at one of the participating surgical site identified in the protocol. Pancreatic resection will be performed according to the localization and extended to nearby organs and/or vessels when invasion is present. Concomitant liver resection may be performed in the presence of liver metastasis.\n\nAssessment of outcomes. 90-day post-operative mortality and morbidity will be classified according to the definition proposed by Dindo et al.\n\nThe rate of objective radiological response to PRRT with 177Lu-OTATATE according to RECIST criteria (version 1.1), for primary lesions' assessment, and modified RECIST criteria (mRECIST), for liver metastases' assessment, if detected.\n\nThe quality of life (QoL) at diagnostic workup, after neoadjuvant PRRT and after the pancreatic surgical resection, will be evaluated by EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire.\n\nData will be collected with CRFs and information will be recorded in a protected database.",

Most have been performed in healthy controls or patients on treatment with proton pump inhibitors for chronic gastritis (up to n = 11 per group) but only one study has investigated patients with GEP-NET, where n = 6 patients with gastric NET were included.\n\nIn this study, the investigators aim to assess the time dependent effects of normally ingested diet (5-item English breakfast; or tea or coffee; or ongoing fasted state) on plasma chromogranin A measurements, using timed measurements over 180 min following an \\> 10 hours overnight fast, in a randomised double-crossover design. The investigators aimed to include 25 - 35 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of a GEP-NET of varying primary tumour location, tumour stage, grade; and presence or absence of treatment with long acting somatostatin analogues; as well as 10 - 15 healthy controls. In an additional small subgroup of patients who are initiated on treatment with GLP-1 analogues i.e. for type 2 diabetes or obesity, the investigators aim to establish whether injection of GLP-1 analogues has any effects on plasma CgA measurements.",

      "brief_summary": "With so many therapeutic options available (i.e.: biologic therapy, liver directed therapy, radiotherapy and chemotherapy), the purpose of this project is to partner with patients on comparative effectiveness research (CER) to achieve the goal of alleviating undue toxicity, and optimizing effectiveness and sequencing of therapy for neuroendocrine tumors (NET) patients. We will conduct a study of all newly occurring GEP-NET and lung NET cases aged 18 years and older diagnosed between 01/01/2018 through 09/30/2024 across 14 sites participating in the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), enrolling an average of 215 patients per site over the 3 year study period (2515 patients total), allowing up to 60 months of follow-up for medical record outcomes. Participants will complete four online or paper surveys over 18 months; these surveys will focus on patient-reported outcomes, including questions on quality of life, treatment decisions, and experiences with cancer care. Survey data will be linked to participant medical record data to achieve study aims.",
      "detailed_description": "NETs are a group of neoplasms that occur most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract, pancreas and the lungs, collectively referred to as gastroenteropancreatic (GEP-NETs) and lung-NETs. There are currently fewer than 180,000 patients living with this condition in the United States, meeting the criteria for rare disease status. NETs are typically slow growing, with vague signs and a myriad of symptoms (carcinoid syndrome) leading to diagnostic delays. Thus, NET patients typically experience a prolonged clinical course with active disease, and many have significant symptom burdens. However, assessment of quality of life outside of therapy trials remains scarce and of poor quality. What's more, over half of GEP-NETs are diagnosed with spread of their disease at diagnosis and are not candidates for curative surgery. Fortunately, many of these tumors are amenable to long-term medical treatment with somatostatin analogues (SSAs)- which slow down the production of hormones, especially serotonin, which helps to control the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. However, living with distant spread of the disease increases the probability for the disease to progress. Following failure of first-line SSA therapy there are no clear consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of other therapeutic options. NET patients are left wondering not only 'what therapy would be best to try next?', but 'if I were to take this option now, what treatment options will be closed off to me in the future?' and clinicians are unsure as to how best to tailor treatment selection on the characteristics of the patient and their tumor.\n\nThere is currently no large nationally recruiting prospective (forward in time) observational study of NET patients. Our large study will robustly generate real-world evidence on the frequency and sequence of commonly used treatments for GEP and lung NET patients in relation to Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and survival/progression, endpoints that matter most to NET patients, their caregivers, and clinicians involved in their care. Given the lack of consensus guidelines as to the optimum sequencing of treatments, evidence generated in this study will aid patient (and clinician) navigation and selection of the next most appropriate therapy, accounting for the preferences and needs of the individual patient, whilst respecting the underlying profile of their tumor. Moreover, the infrastructure this study will generate (i.e.: electronic identification of NET patients, entry and completion of tumor table data in PCORnet, and a unique NET patient health record portal), will foster future CER studies in NETs and other rare diseases.\n\nThe four specific aims of this project are:\n\n1. To describe the frequency of treatment regimens received by line of therapy, and examine their association with symptom burden and changes in 6, 12 and 18 month health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes. The influence of patient preferences, beliefs, attitudes, and experience of care on choice of these treatment regimens will also be examined.\n2. To examine the association of patient, clinical, and tumor characteristics on the selection of first-line and beyond treatment regimens and compare the effects of common treatment sequences on frequency of subsequent treatments received and outcomes of overall survival and disease progression.\n3. To compare the effectiveness of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) regimens on outcomes of renal toxicity, disease progression, and patient-reported symptoms and HRQoL.\n4. To disseminate lessons learned and expand enrollment of the prospective cohort to patient advocate organizations, and to use the infrastructure developed to aid in the study of other rare diseases.",

      "brief_summary": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a diagnostic imaging technique that uses positron emission (e-) to image changes in diagnosed tissues. Detector systems are an important part of PET scanners. They can convert gamma photons into fluorescent photons to obtain information about energy, time and position, of the gamma photons obtained through the use of an appropriate positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical. Conventional PET scanners are expensive mostly because they require the use of LSO (lutetium oxyorthosilicate) or LYSO (lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate) scintillation crystals. Such crystal scintillators are very costly and difficult to obtain, which limits accessibility of the PET- scanners. The prototype J-PET scanner tested in this trial uses plastic scintillators in which different physical phenomena occur compared to crystal scintillators. In addition, the J-PET scanner prototype is equipped with unique software enabling three-photon imaging, based on the annihilation resulting from the formation of the orto-positronium (o-Ps) in diagnosed tissue. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the clinical acceptability of such scanners based on plastic scintillators, which can additionally collect and process information on the lifetime of o-Ps derived from routinely used radiopharmaceuticals. Additionally, the aim of this study is to demonstrate the use of the new diagnostic indicator \"positronium biomarker\" in a prospective study, compared to routine diagnostic scanning.",
      "detailed_description": "The J-PET scanner is the world's first positron tomograph based on plastic strip scintillators to measure the lifetime of the ortho-positronium (o-Ps) atom. This is a modular scanner, designed and installed at the Department of Experimental Particle Physics and Applications of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow. The J-PET scanner is based on technology patented in 2014 and 2016.\n\nThe J-PET scanner, unlike PET scanners commonly used in diagnostics, has three important features:\n\n1. J-PET scintillators are made of plastic instead of expensive-to-produce LSO (lutetium oxyorthosilicate) or LYSO (lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate) scintillation crystals use in regular PET scanners;\n2. J-PET is modular and can be adapted to the patient's size and expanded to a total-body PET scanner because;\n3. J-PET can be used to test an additional parameter called the \"positronium biomarker\" which has not been used so far.\n\nAd. 1. Conventional PET scanners use LSO or LYSO scintillation crystals, which exploit the photoelectric effect and convert gamma photons into fluorescent photons to obtain information on the energy, time and position of gamma photons emitted by the positron annihilation (e+) process obtained by using an appropriate e+ emitting radiopharmaceutical. In plastic scintillators used in J-PET, the Compton effect is used, i.e. the phenomenon of scattering of high-energy photons on free or weakly bound electrons of the scintillator.\n\nAd. 2. The modular J-PET scanner can also be easily integrated with existing computed tomography (CT) systems, allowing for simultaneous conduction of both types of examinations.\n\nAd. 3. Positronium imaging is applied in the J-PET scanner. The PET technique uses radioisotopes that emit positron radiation (beta+). Traditional PET scanners image the distribution of gamma ray photons produced by the annihilation of an electron (e-) and a positron (e+). Annihilation may be preceded by the appearance of a positron atom - a quasi-stable system composed of an electron (e-) and its antiparticle - positron (e+), which occurs in approximately 30-40% of all annihilations occurring in the patient's body.\n\nThe time of such annihilation taking place through the state of the positronium atom depends on whether a positronium will be created in which e- and e+ will have parallel spins (triplet state ↑↑, this system is called ortho-positronium - o-Ps) or antiparallel spins (state singlet ↑ ↓, this system is called para-positronium - p-Ps). The average life time of o-Ps in vacuum is more then 1000 times longer (142 nano-seconds \\[ns\\]), then the average life time of p-Ps (125 pico-seconds \\[ps\\]). The average lifetime of o-Ps in a vacuum is over 1000 times longer (142 nanoseconds \\[ns\\]) than the average lifetime of p-Ps (125 picoseconds \\[ps\\]). The second difference is that o-Ps annihilation takes place over 3 photons, which has not been detected so far and which traditional PET. the annihilation time of the o-Ps atom can be an additional diagnostic parameter (\"positronium biomarker\") to be measured and analyzed in the J-PET scanner.\n\nThe clinical application of such \"positronium biomarker\" in terms of lesion detection, image quality and quantification is yet to be determined, which this study aims to address.",

      "detailed_description": "This cohort (retro- \\& prospective) study will be conducted at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust (GSTTFT) among patients undergoing MRT. Pre and post-therapy blood tests, treatment administration, whole body and SPECT/PET imaging will be undertaken in strict accordance with existing GSTTFT approved protocols for each type of treatment. With the exception of hyperthyroid patients receiving I-131 therapy, these procedures are all part of the standard of care at GSTT. Hyperthyroid patients will be required to have one whole-body scan at 24hrs post-therapy activity administration in addition to their standard care. This will not result in additional radiation exposure.\n\nThe decision to proceed with MRT will have been agreed upon at the relevant multidisciplinary meeting in accordance with current practice guidelines. Pre and post-therapy blood tests, whole body and SPECT/PET imaging will be followed as per current GSTTFT protocols. Patients will be asked to undertake the following:\n\n1. Neuroendocrine tumour and thyroid cancer patients: 1-7 days treatment whole-body gamma camera and SPECT /CT scan. (Part of standard of care post-treatment monitoring at GSTTFT).\n\n   \\*Hyperthyroid patients: 24-hour post-treatment whole-body gamma camera scan. (Part of this research protocol, will not involve any additional radiation).\n2. Record SELFIE reading for 28 days post-therapy using the sheet provided. (Part of this research protocol).\n3. Complete feedback questionnaire. (Part of this research protocol). \\*Benign thyroid disease patients only: Reasonable travel expenses for the cost of an additional hospital visit for post-treatment scans will be reimbursed from the nuclear medicine research fund SPF228. (Maximum reimbursement 50 £)\n\nFor the purpose of this study, two dosimetry methods will be used and compared.\n\n1. Whole-body self-monitored retention measurements study (SELFIE study):\n\n   A handheld radiation monitor (ATOMTEX model AT6130, Belarus) will be used to follow the time course of radioactivity clearance in each patient. The measurement device (SELFIE device) will be introduced to patients by a member of the medical physics team. Patients will be shown how to operate and record readings obtained and will also receive illustrated written instructions to build confidence. The devices are user friendly and patients will be asked to record the measurements twice daily using a diary sheet, typically taking about one minute to complete on each occasion. Measurement can begin immediately following administration and will continue for 28 days afterwards.\n\n   Following MRT administration, a standard whole-body dosimetry measurement will be taken by a medical physicist at 1 and 2 meters distance. The patient will begin to take SELFIE readings at the same time under supervision so that their records can be compared with the physicists' results.\n\n   After 28 days, patients will be asked to return the diary sheet and SELFIE monitor by post to GSTTFT in a pre-paid, pre-addressed envelope.\n\n   On completion of the 28-day exercise, patients will be asked to complete and return a feedback questionnaire.\n\n   The paper record of SELFIE readings will be reviewed by investigators from each patient for 28 days post-therapy. All imaging will be performed at GSTTFT by specialist Nuclear Medicine/PET staff.\n\n   All acquired images will be reconstructed and analysed by investigators using HERMES software as described in section 13.3.\n2. Imaging response assessment Planar Whole body, SPECT/CT and PET/CT images will be acquired to assess uptake patterns and, in the case of sequential treatments, uptake/retention changes. SPECT/CT, PET/CT and whole-body scans will be performed in accordance with existing protocols at Guy's and St. Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. This will not result in additional radiation exposure. (Schedule illustrated in 16.1 Appendix).\n\nThe SUV of target and non-target tissues will be calculated from quantitative pre and post-therapy PET/CT and post-therapy SPECT/CT images. As a result, early tumour response and toxicity in patients undergoing molecular targeted radionuclide therapy can be studied.\n\nPatient-led dose rate (SELFIE) data and imaging data will be integrated to compare whole-body retention and evaluate sequential dose rate changes after repeated treatments.\n\nThe quality of SELFIE data will be assessed against pre-specified standards (completeness of data collection, data deviation). Patient satisfaction will be evaluated from the feedback questionnaire.",

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are a network of rare tumors with common embryological origin. Functional imaging plays a major role in the extension assessment and tumor characterization of NETs. SPECT/CT with 111In-pentetreotide is the recommended test when tumors are well differentiated (grade G1 or G2). It has a real interest in diagnosis, in therapeutic decision-making (in particular by cold somatostatin analogues or in PRRT) and in the systematic follow-up of patients. Nevertheless, SPECT/CT procedure makes for a relatively long review. In addition, scintigraphy has a lower spatial resolution than PET technology and remains of limited interest for signal quantification.\n\nHowever, the ability to locate and quantitatively measure the absorption of radiopharmaceuticals in the target tissues is a major challenge in oncology for the characterization of the disease.\n\nRecent developments in radiopharmacy have made it possible to target NETs in PET imaging through the use of somatostatin analogues coupled with positron emitters, called 68Ga-DOTA peptides. The diagnostic performance of 68Ga-DOTApeptide PET/CT appears to be superior to SPECT/CT with 111In-pentetreotide. A marketing authorization has thus recently been issued in France for the use of 68Ga-DOTATOC.\n\nHistorically, the recommended quantification method in PET was based on the instantaneous measurement in static acquisition (3D) of the maximum of the standardized uptake value (SUVmax). This approach has the disadvantage to measure the signal at a time \"t\" for a single voxel of the image. Dynamic acquisition methods (4D) have been proposed to extract a radiotracer absorption coefficient (Ki) for a lesion. Several studies have demonstrated the superiority of Ki versus SUVmax in 18FDG PET/CT for the diagnostic management, therapeutic evaluation and prognosis of various solid cancers.\n\nHowever, no work has validated this approach in PET / CT at 68Ga-DOTATOC as part of the prognostic evaluation of NETs.\n\nThe objective of the study is to evaluate the prognostic value of the tumor absorption coefficient Ki resulting from a 4D whole-body dynamic acquisition in PET / CT at 68Ga-DOTATOC in patients with well-differentiated NETs grade I or II according to the WHO classification",

If the hypothesis is finally proved, it will help doctors and molecular biologists to choose the best drug (or combination of drugs) based on the individual oncogenomics of each patient.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a prospective, open label, real-world study to evaluate the feasibility of matched molecular targeted therapy in patients with refractory gastrointestinal cancer based on tumor molecular characteristics as standard treatment failure. This is a non-randomized trial designed to test molecular matching strategies based on patient genome information. The molecular tumor board (MTB) will recommend treatment, but the treatment decision is up to the attending physician. FoundationOne CDx was used for tissue genomic analysis. If possible, PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor mutation load (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI) status will also be evaluated. Based on this information, MTB, composed of multidisciplinary experts, will focus on the selection of customized, best matched drugs or combinations to target most of the genomic changes in each patient, also taking into account potential drug toxicity. The final treatment will be based on the choice of oncologists, who will formulate treatment plan by combining MTB discussion, patient preference, attention to complications, consideration of drug toxicity, insurance coverage of off label drugs and availability of clinical trials of research drugs, thus reflecting the actual clinical practice nowadays in China. The acquisition of drugs follows the actual situation in the real world and is not within the scope of this study design.\n\nThe principles of MTB treatment recommendations can be referred to the NCI-MATCH trial:\n\nGrade 1: FDA / NMPA approval; clear evidence and mechanism; concomitant diagnostic relationship between drug and target.\n\nGrade 2: The drug reaches the clinical end point (objective response rate, PFS or OS); there is evidence of target inhibition; there is strong evidence to predict relationship between the target and the drug.\n\nGrade 3: The drug has evidence of clinical activity and target inhibition; there is some evidence to predict the relationship between target and drug.\n\nGrade 4: Pre-clinical evidence of anti-tumor activity and evidence of target inhibition; there is hypothesis to predict the relationship between target and drug.\n\nPatients who meet the inclusion criteria and sign informed consent will be analyzed for tumor mutation by FoundationOne CDx detection. Biopsy specimens of metastatic foci can be selected for gene detection. If there is no targeted therapy among patients, the archived diagnostic tumor samples can also be used for detection. If the patient has received targeted therapy, the investigators will try to obtain biopsy samples after treatment. If the sample cannot be tested or the test results are not satisfactory, additional slices need to be sent to the laboratory. If the repeated test fails, repeat biopsy if the clinical conditions permit, or patients should be included in the unmatched treatment group.\n\nDetermining the interventability of gene mutations depends on genomic changes, allele frequency, and diagnosis. This study will combine the recommendations of MTB and gene testing reports to determine the interventability of mutated genes.\n\nInterventional mutation: cancers have FDA or NMPA approved therapies, or there are matching drugs in clinical trials.\n\nNon-interventional mutation: there is no FDA or NMPA approved treatment for cancers, and no matching drug is available in clinical trials.\n\nMTB should at least be composed of attending doctors, molecular pathology experts and bioinformatics experts. The research center is responsible for the establishment and holding of MTB. As management of patients enrolled in this study is essential, the research committee, including but not limited to the main investigator of the study and the treated medical oncologist, can provide advice as needed between MTB meetings to avoid treatment delays. By analyzing the genomic variation of patients, independent MTB recommends molecular targeted therapy that can inhibit the mutation directly or through related pathways or be included in relevant clinical trials. The independent research committee will use the \"N-to-1\" model of precision medicine to propose a matching therapy consisting of at least one drug that targets molecular changes. The investigators expect 50-70% of patients to carry intervening variants, and that proportion is rising rapidly as learning more about these pathways and drugs. The investigators expect that about 40% of patients with intervening variants will be able to receive molecular targeted \"matching\" therapy.",

It was assumed that no well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor with a mitotic- or a Ki-67- index above 20% existed.\n\nRecently, a proportion of neuroendocrine tumors corresponding to grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors with a proliferation- or Ki-67 index \\> 20% and with a well-differentiated morphology have been identified. This entity has been partially explored and may have a different survival than grade 3 NEC. Furthermore, targeted therapies, and used in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have not been assessed in this case.\n\nThe TENpath network is a pathological network whose goal is the systematic reading of all diagnosed cases of neuroendocrine tumors. As part of this network, nearly 3.000 neuroendocrine tumors were reviewed by pathologist experts. Of all the reviewed tumors, 167 were identified as well-differentiated grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors, observed Ki-67(5.6%) confirming the existence of this entity.\n\nTreatment and follow-up of well-differentiated grade 3 tumors are not consensus-based and recommendations are exclusively based on experts' opinions. The purpose of this study is to define the characterization of this entity and evaluate the efficacy of chemotherapy on well-differentiated grade 3 digestive neuroendocrine tumors identified from the TENpath network.",

      "detailed_description": "After being informed about the study and the potential risks and benefits, participants who provide written consent will be screened to make sure they fulfil the study entry requirements. This will involve a detailed medical history, a CT and an echo scan.\n\nOnce it is agreed that the participant is suitable for the study, a custom-made TRICENTO valve is prescribed and made. Participants need to be admitted to hospital for the TRICENTO device to be implanted. Before the device is implanted the participant will have further tests and measurements completed eg ECG, a Cardiac MRI, physical measurements such as height, weight and blood pressure, blood tests, questionnaires and measuring how far they can walk in 6 minutes.\n\nThe device is implanted in a cath lab procedure which should take about 30-60 minutes in total. Participants should be discharged from hospital about 2-3 days later after recovery and further echocardiogram, blood tests and questionnaires.\n\nFollow up visits are at 1 month and 6 months after the procedure. The following measurements such as an ECG, echocardiogram, and physical measurements (height, weight and blood pressure), some blood tests, questionnaires and measuring how far they can walk in 6 minutes will be repeated at 1 month and at 6 months after the procedure. A cardiac MRI will also be repeated at 6 months after the procedure.

Compared to healthy cells, the surface of these tumor cells has a greater number of special molecules called somatostatin receptors (SSTR). Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and conventional imaging are used to detect NETs.\n\nThis study proposes 18F-AmBF3-TATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is superior to current imaging techniques. The goal is to evaluate the biodistribution and safety of 18F-AmBF3-TATE PET/CT for neuroendocrine tumour imaging.",

The 18F-AmBF3-TATE radioactive tracer is manufactured for this study under a Clinical Trial Application filed with Health Canada.\n\nAfter providing informed written consent subjects will complete a medical history questionnaire.\n\nMonitoring of adverse events There will be short-term evaluation of adverse events by comparison of vital signs before and after administration of 18F-AmBF3-TATE . Eighteen to seventy-two hours after 18F-AmBF3-TATE administration the participant will return to the imaging department to perform a follow up safety assessment and routine blood draw. The study coordinator will ask the participant if they have experienced any adverse events during that time period and complete the adverse event questionnaire.\n\nFollow-up Assessments\n\nThe following information will be collected up to 12 months following the PET/CT scans:\n\nInitiation of a new treatment, Laboratory results and pathology reports, Results of imaging studies, Final clinical diagnosis by physician and relevant clinical notes. The study is expected to take up to 1 year for accrual.",

Detection of NEN and monitoring of response to therapy is still challenging due to their cellular heterogeneity. Initial preclinical studies suggest that NEN imaging with the use of SSTR2-Antagonist may be advantageous in comparison to the widely used SSTR2-Agonists.\n\nRecently, novel radiopharmaceuticals, based on SSTR2-Antagonists, were shown to provide superior SSTR2 visualisation than currently used agonists. The need for molecular imaging of NEN is expected to grow significantly in the near future due to their increasing incidence and prevalence. Although a persistent trend to shift the molecular imaging of NEN from conventional SPECT/CT gamma cameras to PET/CT has been observed in the last decade, labelling the compound with Tc-99m offers significant advantages by its extremely wide availability, low cost and low radiation exposure to patients. Effective and accessible molecular imaging methods as an integral part of personalised patient management are needed to optimise selection and follow-up of available therapeutic modalities. The Tc-99m-labeled SSTR2-Antagonist \\[99mTc\\]Tc-TECANT1 is expected to be an effective, widely available compound for quantitative assessment of SSTR2 NEN status, allowing a personalised therapeutic approach.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that arise from various endocrine glands, endocrine cells within non-endocrine tissue and diffuse endocrine cells of the gastrointestinal, respiratory and genitourinary tract. Detection of NEN and monitoring of their response to therapy is challenging due to their varied location (often-unknown primary focus) and cellular heterogeneity. NEN exhibit a wide range of histological appearances and biological behaviors, and may all potentially behave in an aggressive manner, irrespective of the initial diagnosis. Consequently, the prediction of clinical outcomes in an individual patient is often difficult and inaccurate. According to some national registries, the incidence of NEN increased more than 6-fold and the prevalence more than 8-fold between 1973 and 2012, making NEN the second most prevalent diagnosis in gastrointestinal malignancies, thus representing a growing challenge. The rise in the incidence can be partly attributed to increased awareness of the disease and better detection methods. Diagnostic imaging is an integral part of the management of patients with NEN by localising the primary or recurrence site, determining the extent of the disease and evaluating response to therapy. Nuclear medicine with single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) is a branch of molecular imaging: in contrast to anatomical imaging, it depicts functional changes and biological characteristics of target tissues, providing a unique insight into the biology of malignant disease, and has established itself as an excellent tool in personalized medicine. The characteristic feature of NEN is an overexpression of somatostatin receptors (SSTR) on cell membranes. Molecular imaging techniques utilise the ability of SST analogues labelled with radioactive (single-photon or positron emitting) nuclides to bind to the SSTR. A combination of molecular and anatomical imaging (hybrid imaging, SPECT/CT and PET/CT) is currently the most sensitive approach to visualisation of SSTR-positive tumours. In NEN patients the prognosis depends on the grade and stage of the tumour. However, SSTR expression determines not only efficacy of staging using molecular imaging methods, but also efficacy of antiproliferative therapy with SST analogues both not radiolabelled (\"cold\") and labelled with a therapeutic radionuclide thus enabling Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT) as the main approach to personalised NEN patients' management. Traditionally, radiolabelled SST analogues were constructed aiming at their agonistic behaviour, based on their internalisation after SSTR activation and consequent retention within the tumour cells, believed to be crucial for efficient molecular imaging and therapy. Recently, it has been shown that novel molecular probes, SSTR antagonists, recognise more binding sites and hence improve diagnostic efficacy, especially when the density of SSTR is low. Accumulating preclinical and clinical data using both SPECT and PET tracers shows that high-affinity SSTR antagonists can provide better SSTR visualisation than agonists. Preclinical data and subsequent clinical evaluation demonstrated higher tumour uptake of an In-111-labelled antagonist \\[111In\\]In-DOTA-sst2-ANT (\\[111In\\]In-DOTA-BASS) compared to the agonist \\[111In\\]In-DTPA0-octreotide or \\[111In\\]In -DTPA0-octreotate, as well as superior tumour-to-background ratios. One of the first reports describing the SSTR2 antagonist LM3 indicates the high potential of gallium-68 (Ga-68) and copper-64 (Cu-64) radiolabelled LM3 in PET/CT. The authors demonstrated strong dependence of the affinity and pharmacokinetics of the SST-based radiolabelled antagonists on the chelator and radiometal, also confirmed using another SSTR antagonist, namely JR11. The Superiority of the SSTR antagonist was demonstrated in the Phase I/II clinical study using a positron emitter, \\[68Ga\\]Ga-NODAGA-JR11 and in a pilot study conducted with beta-emitting, therapeutic radionuclide (lutetium-177, Lu-177) labelled SSTR antagonist \\[177Lu\\]Lu-DOTA-JR11. As a result, research in the field is currently strongly focused on SSTR antagonists. Ga-68-labelled SST analogues have already established PET as a unique tool for personalising treatment of NEN. Nevertheless, single-photon emitting radiopharmaceuticals still represent the cornerstone of molecular imaging, particularly those based on Technetium-99m (Tc-99m). Its physical properties (half-life of 6 hours, optimal energy of 140 keV for imaging and lowest radiation exposure), widest on-site availability and cost-effectiveness are of major importance for routine clinical applications. Medical diagnostic imaging techniques using Tc-99m account for approximately 80% of all nuclear medicine procedures, representing 30-40 million examinations worldwide every year; even in developed countries, the number of gamma cameras in use exceeds by far the number of PET systems. Considering the above-mentioned characteristics Tc-99m is perfect for research with new radiotracers and is still recognised as the workhorse of diagnostic nuclear medicine. Quantifiable uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in target tissue using standardised methods and metrics such as standardised uptake value (SUV) is currently a unique feature of PET allowing highly personalized approaches to patient management and is part of clinical routine. It was shown also in NEN that the quantitative approach is able to adequately predict and evaluate the response to various treatments available, including \"cold\" and radiolabelled somatostatin analogues (PRRT). However, single-photon quantitative imaging has developed significantly and is also entering clinical routine. Identical quantitative metrics are becoming available with the use of SPECT/CT systems (SPECT SUV) with comparable accuracy and clinical applicability. The development of a quantitative SPECT imaging approach in NEN, in combination with improved, widely available radiopharmaceuticals, would therefore represent a highly significant improvement in management, tailored to the needs of each individual patient.",

However, their prognosis is more negative, with the 5-year survival at less than 20%.\n\nMany Phase III trials showed superiority in terms of efficacy and tolerance of nivolumab+/-ipilimumab versus standard chemotherapy in second-line treatment in metastatic solid tumors. Neuroendocrine tumors are considered as rare disease without therapeutic guidelines in this setting.

However, some studies indicate that the sample adequacy for histologic evaluation is higher when using FNB compared with FNA needles. The diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor (NET), autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), and other gastrointestinal stromal tumors require high-quality tissue sampling for IHC diagnosis. Whether FNB is superior to FNA in these IHC-required lesions remains unclear.\n\nThe investigators performed this at 2 tertiary care centers in China. The study prospectively collected patients undergoing EUS for a solid mass (\\>1 cm) in the pancreas, abdomen, mediastinum, or pelvic cavity from December 2014 diagnosed with AIP, NET, mesenchymal tumors, and Lymphoma. Patients accepted FNB or FNA according to doctors' and patients' willingness in a real-world setting. All procedures were performed by experienced endosonographers; cytologists and pathologists were blinded to the sample collection method. Patients were followed for at least 48 weeks, and final diagnoses were obtained after surgery, imaging analysis, or resolution of the lesion. The primary aim was to compare diagnostic yields of EUS-FNA with EUS-FNB for all solid masses, then separately as AIP, NET, mesenchymal tumors, and lymphoma. The secondary endpoint was the quality of the histologic specimen.",

Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab may shrink the cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\nI. To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) associated with the combination of XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, and ipilimumab in patients with advanced poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), after the failure of at least one line of prior therapy.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS). II. To measure the safety and tolerability of the combination of XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, and ipilimumab in patients with advanced, poorly-differentiated NECs.\n\nIII. To evaluate disease control rate (DCR). IV. To measure duration of response (DOR). V. To describe the tumor molecular profile using whole exome sequencing (WES) and correlate it with treatment outcome.\n\nVI. To describe the tumor molecular profile using ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing (RNAseq) and correlate it with treatment outcome.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To measure the tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T lymphocytes in pre- and on-treatment biopsies.\n\nII. To measure tumor-infiltrating myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in pre- and on-treatment biopsies.\n\nIII. To measure tumor-infiltrating tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in the pre and on-treatment biopsies.\n\nIV. To measure the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of cycles 1-4 and days 1-28 of subsequent cycles, nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1, and ipilimumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1-4 only.

Radiotherapy should have been stopped at least 4 weeks prior to study registration. Brain surgery should not have occurred within 3 months of study registration to be eligible\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* The effects of XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, and ipilimumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP should use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 5 months after the last dose of study therapy. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity: 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \\[hCG\\]) within 24 hours prior to the start of study therapy. Women must not be breastfeeding. Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of \\< 1% per year. Men who receive study therapy and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of study therapy. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile) as well as azoospermic men do not require contraception. WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level \\< 40 mIU/mL. WOCBP and men who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 and 7 months, respectively, after the last dose of study therapy. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) must inform the treating physician immediately\n* Patients must be able to swallow tablets\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses \\< 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease. Patients are permitted to use topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalational corticosteroids (with minimal systemic absorption). Physiologic replacement doses of systemic corticosteroids in patients with adrenal insufficiency are permitted, even if \\>= 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents. A brief course of corticosteroids for prophylaxis or for treatment of non-autoimmune conditions (e.g., delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction caused by contact allergen) is permitted, as is steroid pre-medication for contrast allergy\n* Patients must not have had prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CTLA-4 antibody, or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T cell co-stimulation or immune checkpoint pathways\n* Patients must not have had prior treatment with XL184 (cabozantinib), or any MET-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), or any MET-targeting monoclonal antibody (MetMAb), such as onartuzumab\n* Patients must not have received radiation therapy to any part of the body within 28 days\n* Patients must not have clinically relevant, ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy. No radiation therapy is allowed while the patient is on study. Palliative radiation therapy, if needed, should be completed at least 28 days prior to enrollment into the study as described above\n* Patients must not require concomitant treatment with oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, direct thrombin, and factor Xa inhibitors) or platelet inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel). The following anticoagulants are allowed:\n\n  * Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (per local applicable guidelines),\n  * Low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH),\n  * Therapeutic doses of LMWH are allowed in patients without known brain metastases who are on a stable dose of LMWH for at least 6 weeks before the first dose of study treatment, and who have had no clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor\n* Patients must not have had major surgery (e.g., gastrointestinal \\[GI\\] surgery or removal or biopsy of brain metastasis) within 4 weeks before first dose of study treatment. Complete wound healing from major surgery must have occurred 1 month before the first dose of study treatment and from minor surgery (e.g., simple excision or tooth extraction) at least 10 days before the first dose. Patients with clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior surgery are not eligible\n* Patients must not have received cytotoxic chemotherapy (including investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy) or biologic agents (e.g., cytokines or antibodies) within 4 weeks, or nitrosoureas/ mitomycin C within 4 weeks, before the first dose of study treatment.

Patients must not have received any other type of investigational agent within 4 weeks before the first dose of study treatment to be eligible\n* Patients must not have a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) \\> 500 msec by electrocardiogram (EKG) within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment\n\n  * Note: If a single EKG shows a QTcF with an absolute value \\> 500 msec, two additional EKGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30 min after the initial EKG, and the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility\n* Patients should not have known, untreated brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases because of poor prognosis and concerns that progressive neurologic dysfunction could confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to agents used in study\n* Patients must not have a history of severe hypersensitivity reactions to any monoclonal antibodies\n* Patients must not require concomitant treatment with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, or St. John's wort). Because lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, patients will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients must not have uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\n  * Cardiovascular disorders:\n\n    * Congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class 3 or 4, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.\n    * Uncontrolled hypertension defined as sustained blood pressure (BP) \\> 140 mm Hg systolic or \\> 90 mm Hg diastolic despite optimal antihypertensive treatment within seven days prior to the first dose of study treatment.\n    * Stroke (including transient ischemic attack \\[TIA\\]), myocardial infarction (MI), or other ischemic event, or thromboembolic event (e.g., deep venous thrombosis \\[DVT\\], pulmonary embolism \\[PE\\]) within 6 months before first dose.\n  * GI disorders including those associated with a high risk of perforation or fistula formation:\n\n    * The patient has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract, active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, cholecystitis, symptomatic cholangitis or appendicitis, acute pancreatitis, acute obstruction of the pancreatic duct or common bile duct, or gastric outlet obstruction.\n    * Abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months before first dose. Complete healing of an intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed before first dose.\n  * Clinically significant hematuria, hematemesis, or hemoptysis or other history of significant bleeding (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage) within 12 weeks before first dose.\n  * Cavitating pulmonary lesion(s) or known endotracheal or endobronchial disease manifestation.\n  * Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels.\n  * Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study participation.\n\n    * Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture.\n    * Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism.\n    * Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because XL184 (cabozantinib) has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects, and the effects of nivolumab and ipilimumab on the developing fetus are not well known. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated with XL184 (cabozantinib), nivolumab, or ipilimumab\n* Patients with active autoimmune disease or history of autoimmune disease that might recur, which may affect vital organ function or require immune suppressive treatment including high dose systemic corticosteroids, should be excluded. These include but are not limited to: immune-related neurologic disease, such as multiple sclerosis, autoimmune (demyelinating) neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or myasthenia gravis; systemic autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), connective tissue diseases, scleroderma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, or autoimmune hepatitis. Patients with a history of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or phospholipid syndrome should be excluded because of the risk of recurrence or exacerbation of disease. Patients with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus (DM), or endocrine deficiencies (e.g., thyroiditis) managed with replacement hormones, including physiologic corticosteroids, are eligible. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other arthropathies, Sjogren's syndrome and psoriasis controlled with topical medication, and patients with positive serology, (e.g., antinuclear antibodies \\[ANA\\] or anti-thyroid antibodies) should be evaluated for the presence of target organ involvement and potential need for systemic treatment but should otherwise be eligible",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, capecitabine, cisplatin, carboplatin and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Certain types of neuroendocrine carcinomas may respond better to treatments other than the current standard treatment of cisplatin and etoposide. It is not yet known whether temozolomide and capecitabine may work better than cisplatin or carboplatin and etoposide in treating patients with this type of neuroendocrine carcinoma, called non-small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma.",

To assess the response rate (RR) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the RR of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nII. To assess the overall survival (OS) of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus the OS of temozolomide and capecitabine in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nIII. To evaluate the toxicities associated with the combination of temozolomide and capecitabine and the combination of platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide, respectively, in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the impact of each treatment regimen on PFS, RR and OS based on marker of proliferation Ki-67 index in patients with advanced G3 non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinomas. (Laboratory) II. To assess the prognostic significance of well differentiated versus poorly differentiated non-small cell gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in relationship to survival and response to treatment. (Laboratory) III. To assess the agreement in Ki-67 status between that reported by institutional pathologist and that reported by central pathology review.

These patients have important supportive care needs that represent a major challenge for improving treatment tolerance and patient survival and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\n\nMalnutrition and sarcopenia (muscle wasting and dysfunction) are associated with an increased risk of death, complications from chemotherapy, infections, emergency procedures and hospitalizations, and increased costs of care. Therefore, malnutrition and sarcopenia represent a major clinical target in GI cancers.\n\nInterventions targeting malnutrition/sarcopenia should be implemented as early as possible in patients' pathways, these syndromes being reversible at early stages but not at late stages.\n\nA multidisciplinary assessment at diagnosis and therapeutic approach combining nutritional support and and adapted physical activity (APA) in addition to anticancer treatments should be systematically implemented in patients with advanced GI cancers.\n\nThis type of intervention complies with the standards recommended by the National Cancer Institute (INCa) to promote the practice of physical activity during and after treatment in oncology.",

Advanced disease not amenable to surgery, radiation, or combined modality therapy with curative intent (previous resection of primary tumor allowed), treated with first-line chemotherapy for advanced disease (previous \\[neo\\]adjuvant chemo\\[radio\\]therapy allowed); or resectable/potentially resectable disease receiving a triplet chemotherapy regimen in a peri-operative setting (e.g. FOLFIRINOX, FLOT) (moderate risk at frailty score)\n5. Patients able to attend for administration of chemotherapy,\n6. Life expectancy ≥ 3 months,\n7. Registration in a National Health Care System (Couverture Maladie Universelle \\[CMU\\] included).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Other active non gastro-intestinal cancers\n2. Any medical (including psychiatric, musculoskeletal, or neurological) condition contra-indicating exercise practice,\n3. Pregnancy or breastfeeding,\n4.

This technology allows precise and early cancer to be visualized and measured on whole body images. Patients with Neuro-Endocrine tumors (NETs), require specialized molecular imaging to stage, re-stage and assess eligibility and response to therapy. 68Ga-DOTATATE is a nuclear medicine imaging agent that is not yet approved by Health Canada but used extensively throughout the world. The Ki-67 index, a marker of cell proliferation in NETs, is one of the most important prognostic factors in this disease. The objective of this study is to evaluate if the maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax) on PET/CT in NETs inversely correlates with Ki-67 score on initial biopsy. If this hypothesized correlation between SUV and Ki-67 score is reproduced, then DOTATATE would serve as a non-invasive method to assess cellular proliferation and therefore prognosis of these patients.",

      "detailed_description": "High grade neuroendocrine tumors often do not express somatostatin (sstr) receptors but often express the CXCR4 receptor. The CXCR4 receptor is a marker of poorly differentiated cells. Pentixafor is a peptide that targets these CXCR4 receptors. By combining it with gallium-68, a radionuclide, pentixafor can then be evaluated as an imaging agent to detect high-grade neuroendocrine tumors.\n\n\\[68Ga\\]Pentixafor is a radio-labelled imaging agent used for positron emission tomography (PET). The dose is small, known as a tracer dose. It is designed to capture information about the body and how the body is working without interfering or causing an effect.\n\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate how the \\[68Ga\\]Pentixafor is distributed through the body after injection and how it is taken up by the organs of the body. The study will also examine if the imaging is reproducible to determine if the PET images show the same uptake of the study drug across different scans.\n\nThis study is an RDRC study - the equivalent to a phase 0 study. The \\[68Ga\\]Pentixafor has not been shown to target tumors; specificity and sensitivity have not been established. For this reason, images obtained for this study cannot be used clinically or shared with treating oncologists.",

CT or MRI must demonstrate at least one lesion (primary or metastatic) present 1.5 cm or larger in any dimension on cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) obtained within 3 months of study enrollment.\n5. Results of CXCR4 immunohistochemistry or slides from biopsy of primary tumor or metastatic lesions available for study analysis.\n6. Participation in the Iowa Neuroendocrine Tumor Registry.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active infection requiring hospitalization, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n2. Physical limitation that would limit compliance with the study requirements\n3. Pregnant or lactating women. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

It is characterized by a high propensity for recurrence and a generally poor prognosis. Due to its rarity, there is limited data and no established consensus on the optimal postoperative adjuvant therapy, making treatment decisions challenging for healthcare providers.\n\nThis study is a retrospective analysis focusing on evaluating survival rates, identifying prognostic factors, and formulating treatment recommendations for patients with G-NEC. By analyzing real-world clinical data, we aim to better understand the factors that influence patient outcomes and to develop evidence-based strategies for improving survival. Our goal is to provide clinicians with valuable insights and tools to make more informed treatment decisions, ultimately enhancing the quality of care and outcomes for patients with this challenging disease.",

Chemotherapy drugs, such as cabazitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as niraparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as cetrelimab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving niraparib with or without cetrelimab, after treatment with cabazitaxel, carboplatin, and cetrelimab, may help control aggressive variant prostate cancer.",

      "detailed_description": "This research study is designed to explore if a new radiotherapeutic (radioactive) drug, named 212Pb (212-lead) VMT-α-NET, works against neuroendocrine tumor cells. To begin researching this drug, we need to determine if \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET is safe and tolerable when used as a cancer treatment. As a safety study, it is unknown if the treatment is safe or effective.\n\nThe study will also estimate the radiation dose to the kidneys for this treatment. To calculate this radiation dose, imaging is also performed with the sister drug, \\[203Pb\\] VMT-α-NET using SPECT/CT imaging. Each participant is assigned a radiation dose to the kidneys that cannot be exceeded. The study is testing the safety of the specific radiation dose to the kidneys when using \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET.\n\nParticipants are assigned a radiation dose based on how other participants have tolerated the \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET. The amount of \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET administered varies person-to-person because of each person's unique tumor uptake of \\[203Pb\\] VMT-α-NET and how long it lasts in the body.\n\nThe study involves 2 treatments, about 8 to 10 weeks apart. The drug is given by infusion once per treatment. The participants also receive an infusion of amino acids to help protect the kidneys as well as medications to help protect against nausea (feeling sick to the stomach).\n\nOnce a participant is administered the \\[212Pb\\] VMT-α-NET, they must be followed (i.e. come back to the clinic) for at least 6 months for safety assessments. Safety assessments include blood tests to check bone marrow, kidney, and liver function as well as urinary tests to check kidney function. Participants will also have imaging at 6 months post-treatment to measure how their tumors responded to therapy.\n\nParticipants will have lifelong follow-up for this study.",

To determine the proportion of patients in whom the addition of 18F-FDG PET/CT data results in a change in planned clinical management.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n1. mTo determine whether there is intra-individual variability in somatostatin receptor expression and glucose metabolism (as seen on DOTATATE PET and FDG PET, respectively) across different tumor sites within the same patient.\n2. To determine whether a correlation exists between tumor texture features on 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and FDG PET to tumor grade and Ki67 index.\n3. To assess if an association exists between tumor texture features on 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and glucose metabolism; and/or an association between tumor texture features on FDG PET and somatostatin receptor expression.",

The management of pancreatic NETs depends on tumor stage and on presence or not of hormonal syndrome. The therapeutic approach for hormonally functional tumor, or large tumor (\\> 2 cm) with local, vascular or lymph nodes invasion, highly suggestive of malignancy, or in presence of metastasis, is well admitted: surgery is indicated or should be discussed. However, the attitude is less consensual for small (≤ 2 cm) non-functioning (NF) and non-metastatic lesions. In English, American or French recommendations, systematic surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is currently recommended in all medically fit patients. The follow-up (FU) is possible for tumors \\<2 cm (T1) located in the pancreatic head and for which enucleation is not feasible.

Given the inherent morbidities associated with pancreatic surgery, a risk-benefit calculation may favour surveillance rather than surgery in highly selected patients.

      "detailed_description": "With increasing use of high-resolution conventional imaging, pancreatic incidentalomas are being diagnosed more frequently. In two recent surgical series, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and carcinomas account for 10-15 % of all pancreatic incidentalomas, the majority ( 75-90 % of cases) well differentiated. The factors affecting the behaviour of pancreatic NETs are differentiation, histological grade, staging, size and intratumoral microvascular density. In updated World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the grading system is based on tumor differentiation, the rate of proliferation and Ki-67 index. The management of pancreatic NETs depends on tumor stage and on presence or not of hormonal syndrome. By definition, the incidentally discovered pancreatic NETs (PNETs) are unassociated with hormonal syndromes (nonfunctioning) and detected in patients who undergo diagnostic evaluations for unrelated conditions.\n\nThe therapeutic approach for hormonally functional tumor, or large tumor (\\> 2 cm) with local, vascular or lymph nodes invasion, highly suggestive of malignancy, or in presence of metastasis, is well admitted: surgery is indicated or should be discussed.\n\nHowever, the attitude is less consensual for small (≤ 2 cm) non-functioning (NF) and non-metastatic lesions. There is a paucity of literature reporting pancreatic neuroendocrine incidentalomas and their characteristics. However, given their increased incidence, they are an emerging problem and require changes in treatment guidelines. In English, American or French recommendations, systematic surgical resection with lymphadenectomy is currently recommended in all medically fit patients. The follow-up (FU) is possible for tumors \\<2 cm (T1) located in the pancreatic head and for which enucleation is not feasible. This therapeutic approach has two limitations: 1) the significant incidence of these tumors, because of the widespread use of routine imaging, and the improved technology of multi detector CT scan, the fortuitous discovery of small pancreatic incidentalomas is becoming more common. 2) Pancreatic surgery carries significant postoperative morbidity even in high-volume tertiary centers and even in parenchyma-preserving resection. This may results in many pancreatic resections for tumors with unknown natural history. On the other hand, the follow-up may be a factor of considerable anxiety, and carries the risk, actually difficult to assess, to let the tumor grow between two monitoring controls, with the possible evolution to the irreversible metastatic stage of the disease.\n\nAs a result, the investigators are unceasingly facing a dilemma: how to manage asymptomatic patients with small incidentally detected, potentially benign NETs? Several recently published retrospective studies discuss the \"non- surgical\" management of the small NF incidentally detected pancreatic NETs (IPNETs) and highlight the necessity of developing guidelines for management of these patients. A strict correlation between tumor size and malignancy of these tumors was demonstrated in the single-center retrospective Italian study of Bettini and col. , which included all patients with NF PNETs who underwent curative (R0) resection during 18 years.

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies the effect of niraparib and dostarlimab in treating small cell lung cancer and other high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Niraparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as dostarlimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving niraparib and dostarlimab may help to control the diseases.",

This improvement in the absorption will be assessed in part by evaluating changes in average daily stool frequency from baseline in patients receiving Enterade®. Each subject serves as his or her own control.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\n* To assess subject reported health-related quality of life in subjects before and after compound administration.\n* To characterize the side effect profile and tolerability of Enterade® as measured by the number of total 8-oz Enterade® bottles consumed throughout the trial, and average drinks per day.\n* To evaluate changes in serum electrolytes before and after administration of Eenterade®.\n* To assess intravenous fluid requirement and/or hospitalization for dehydration secondary to diarrhea between control observation period and active Enterade® period.\n* To evaluate difference in utilization of standard-of-care anti-diarrheal medications between control observation period and Enterade® period.\n* To compare subjective feeling of bloating and flatulence before and after administration of Enterade®.\n* To evaluate changes in patient weight before and after administration of Enterade®.",

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms originating from neuroendocrine cells located throughout the body. They secret various peptides and cause various symptoms (carcinoid syndrome) or not. The incidence of NETs was not well-known till recently when Yao et al. and Hausa et al. published their surveys of NETs using data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and from the Norwegian Registry of Cancer (NRC). The incidence of NETs in Taiwan by using the Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) data was increased from 0.3 to 1.51 per 100,000 from 1996 to 2008. The increased incidence for NET worldwide probably was partially due to the awareness and improvement of diagnostic technology. Compared with the incidence in western countries, the incidence of NET is much lower in Taiwan. And the incidence of NETs in Asian Pacific Islanders was also lower than the whites and blacks in US. Gastroenteral-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs), accounting for half to two thirds of all NETs, is the most common site of NETs. As the progress in the understanding of pathophysiology for GEP-NET, there are two novel targeted agents shown to be effective for the treatment of GEP-NET. Meanwhile, response to mTOR inhibitor was better for Asian than Caucasian in the phase III study using everolimus for advanced pancreatic NETs. These information suggests that there is racial difference for either genetic or environmental risk factors and these factors result in different incidence and/or clinical outcome. Currently, there is limited data for thorough epidemiologic study in Taiwan. The aim of this study is to collect clinical information for GEP-NET, and survey the prognostic factors for GEP-NET in Taiwan. the investigators suppose that this epidemiologic study would provide a database potentially to improve the diagnosis, and treatment of GEP-NET. This study plans to include 600 GEP-NET patients. NET patients diagnosed after 2011.1.1 is included in this study.\n\nFurthermore, the investigators will provide the check of immunohistochemical staining for the tumor tissue of GEP-NET patients, including the functioning status (insulinoma, glucagonoma, gastrinoma, VIPoma) and the degree of differentiation, the expression of SSTR2 or SSTR5 and the check of possible primary site for unknown primary NET patients. This examination will provide more accurate diagnosis for the patients and further treatment suggestion for the patients.",

Compared to healthy cells, the surface of these tumor cells has a greater number of special molecules called somatostatin receptors (SSTR). Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy and conventional imaging are used to detect NETs.\n\nThis study proposes 68Gallium(68Ga)-DOTATOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is superior to current imaging techniques. The goal is to evaluate the safety and sensitivity of 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT at detecting NETs and other tumors with over-expression of somatostatin receptors.",

The 68Ga-DOTATOC radioactive tracer is manufactured for this study under a Clinical Trial Application filed with Health Canada. 18F-FDG is considered standard care and has been approved by Health Canada.\n\nAfter providing informed written consent subjects will complete a medical history questionnaire.\n\nMonitoring of adverse events There will be short-term evaluation of adverse events by comparison of vital signs before and after administration of 68Ga-DOTATOC. Twenty-four hours after 68Ga-DOTATOC administration the study coordinator will call the patient and see if they have experienced any adverse events during that time period and complete the adverse event questionnaire found in section 9.6.\n\nFollow-up Assessments\n\nThe following information will be collected up to 3 years following the PET/CT scans:\n\n* Initiation of a new treatment\n* Laboratory results and pathology reports\n* Results of imaging studies\n* Final clinical diagnosis by physician and relevant clinical notes\n\nThe study is expected to take approximately 4 years for accrual.",

These tumors arise from special cells called neuroendocrine cells, which are found in these organs and release hormones to regulate various bodily functions. GEP-NETs can be slow-growing, and symptoms may vary depending on their location and size.\n\nAcromegaly is a condition where a person's body produces too much growth hormone. This excess hormone can cause certain body parts, like the hands, feet, and face, to enlarge over time. It typically occurs because of a tumor on the pituitary gland in the brain, which is responsible for regulating hormones. Acromegaly can lead to various health issues if not treated, but medications or surgery can often help manage the condition.\n\nLong-acting somatostatin analogs (LA-SSAs) are indicated for patients with Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) and acromegaly who are not eligible for surgery or when surgery fails to achieve remission.\n\nData for this study will be collected after the treatment switch from the Ipsen lanreotide syringe to the Pharmathen lanreotide syringe has occurred, using one round of one-to-one qualitative telephone and/or videoconference interviews with patients. Interviews will last 45 minutes and be carried out in the local language of the participant's country.\n\nThe main aim of this study is to capture the patient experience of the Ipsen lanreotide syringe and their experience with the Pharmathen lanreotide syringe.",

      "condition": "Neuroendocrine Tumor, Malignant; Neuroendocrine Tumor Gastrointestinal, Hormone-Secreting",
      "intervention": "90Y-DOTA-3-Tyr-Octreotide; 131I-MIBG",
      "brief_summary": "This study is designed to identify the best tolerated doses of \\[131\\]Iodine-MIBG and \\[90\\]Yttrium-DOTATOC when co-administered to treat midgut neuroendocrine tumors. These drugs (131I-MIBG, 90Y-DOTATOC) are radioactive drugs, known as radionuclide therapy. Currently, the safest and best tolerated doses of these drugs (when combined together) is unknown.",
      "detailed_description": "\\[131\\]Iodine-MIBG and \\[90\\]Yttrium-DOTATOC are radioactive drugs designed to treat specific tumor cells. These drugs are a combination of the radiation (131-Iodine, 90-Yttrium) and a protein that targets the tumor cell (MIBG or DOTATOC). Because these proteins are attracted to, and stick to, the tumor, the radiation is centered in the tumors. This kills more tumor cells and minimizes radiation-damage to healthy tissues, like the heart and lungs.\n\nTwo organs still absorb some of the radiation, though: bone marrow and the kidney. These organs limit how much radiation can be given to tumors, but we don't know how much radiation is too much. Too much radiation to bone marrow can result in anemia. Too much radiation to the kidneys can result in kidney failure. From prior radiation therapies, we have a general idea of how much radiation we can give safely.\n\n131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC have never been given together. We want to give them together because many times, tumors are actually groups of different types of cells. This means, not all the cells respond to therapy the same way. If some tumor cells survive therapy, the tumor will continue to grow and eventually come back. We know some mid-gut neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have targets for DOTATOC and some other mid-gut NETs have targets for MIBG. We also have now identified that some people with mid-gut NETs have different tumors: some with targets for MIBG and some with targets for DOTATOC. For these people, this means treating only with 131I-MIBG or 90Y-DOTATOC will not be enough to treat their cancer. They need both radioactive drugs.\n\nBecause we are combining these radioactive drugs, this study is known as a first-in-man study. We are also using a special imaging to help us estimate the radiation dose to the bone marrow and to the kidneys. This is what decides the final dose of 131I-MIBG and 90Y-DOTATOC.\n\nBefore receiving therapy, participants will be asked to undergo imaging to verify they have both MIBG and DOTATOC tumor types:\n\n* participants are given very small doses of radioactive drugs\n* a special camera (SPECT/CT) collects images (scans)\n* imaging (scans) are done over 3 calendar days\n* blood samples are taken at that time, too, to measure the circulating amount of tracer doses\n\nIf the scans show a participant has both MIBG and DOTATOC tumors, therapy is given:\n\n* a customized dose of 90Y-DOTATOC is given on day 1 of a treatment cycle. This is given outpatient.\n* a customized dose of 131I-MIBG is given on day 2 of a treatment cycle. This is given inpatient (admitted to the hospital).\n* participants are monitored through blood tests to identify the side effects of therapy.\n\nEach participant can have up to 2 cycles of therapy. The cycles are 12 weeks apart.\n\nThe doses for 90Y-DOTATOC and 131I-MIBG are decided based on radiation to the bone marrow and radiation to the kidney. Doses are decided by how well other participants have done on this study.\n\nParticipants have life long follow-up for this study. This is very important, because a study like this has not been done.",

      "brief_summary": "This pilot phase II trial studies how effective pembrolizumab and liver-directed therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are at treating patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or progressive tumors that have spread to the liver (liver metastases). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Liver-directed therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial embolization, yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization, and cryoablation may help activate the immune system in order to shrink tumors that are not being directly targeted. Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy is a form of targeted treatment that is performed by the use of a small molecule, which carries a radioactive component attached to a peptide. Once injected into the body, this small molecule binds to some specific sites on tumor cells called receptors and emit medium energy radiation that can destroy cells. Because this radionuclide is attached to the peptide, which binds receptors on tumor lesions, the radiation can preferably be targeted to the tumor cells in order to destroy them. Giving pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapy or peptide receptor radionuclide therapy may work better than pembrolizumab alone.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy (PRRT), transarterial embolization, and radioembolization.\n\nII. To evaluate the best observed overall response rate (ORR) in lesion(s) not targeted for liver-directed therapy (abscopal effect) to pembrolizumab plus liver-directed therapy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for patients with metastatic well-differentiated (WD) neuroendocrine tumors (NET)s (WD-NETs).\n\nIII. To evaluate the best observed ORR to pembrolizumab plus peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) according to RECIST 1.1 for patients with metastatic grade 2 and 3 WD-NET (Ki-67 \\> 10%).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapies or PRRT.\n\nII. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with pembrolizumab in combination with liver-directed therapies or PRRT.\n\nIII. Best observed radiographic ORR per modified RECIST (mRECIST) in lesions targeted for liver-directed therapy.\n\nIV. Duration of response in lesions targeted for liver-directed therapy by mRECIST.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare ORR, DOR, and PFS based on immune-related (ir)RECIST with the same measures assessed by RECIST 1.1.\n\nII. To correlate clinical outcomes (ORR, DOR, PFS) with baseline immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 staining in cycle 1 and cycle 5 tumor biopsies.\n\nIII. To assess the level of PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue prior to liver-directed therapy (prior to PRRT) and 5 weeks following liver-directed therapy (following PRRT).\n\nIV. To assess T cell infiltration on the pre-177Lu-DOTATATE (pre-PRRT) and on the on-treatment tumor tissue biopsies.\n\nV. To assess baseline circulating T cell receptor (TCR) repertories and changes in TCR repertories with treatment, and correlate baseline and turnover of repertories to clinical outcomes.\n\nVI. To analyze the relationship between baseline tumor proliferative index (as measured by Ki67) and response to therapy.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients originally assigned to 1 of 3 groups. As of 09/15/2022, Groups 2 and 3 are closed to enrollment.\n\nGROUP I (PRRT): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. PRRT using 177Lu-DOTATATE(Lutathera®) will be offered to patients with somatostatin receptor positive (SSTR+) tumors with Ki-67 index \\> 20% (well-differentiated grade 3). Patients may have any number of liver and/or extrahepatic lesions with liver parenchyma replacement by tumor \\< 75%. 200±20 millicurie (mCi) of 177Lu-DOTATATE will be administered intravenously per treatment on outpatient basis. Patients will receive a total of four treatments of 177Lu-DOTATATE, administered every 8±1 weeks.

The study included elderly patients aged 65 years or older who underwent surgery for pancreaticobiliary cancer. The trial was conducted between January 7, 2021, and July 18, 2022.\n\nA total of 60 patients were initially enrolled, but after 19 dropouts, the final analysis was based on 41 patients (18 in the placebo group and 23 in the experimental group). The experimental group received protein supplements providing 18g of protein per day, while the control group received a placebo containing carbohydrates instead of protein.\n\nKey outcomes such as nutrient intake, nutritional status, quality of life, muscle mass, muscle strength, and 10-meter gait speed were measured at three time points: before surgery, at discharge, and during an outpatient visit. The data were analyzed using a Linear Mixed-Effects Model to evaluate the effects of the intervention.",

      "detailed_description": "PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS\n\nBackground\n\nNeuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that can arise at any site in the gastrointestinal tract, that are known by their ability to over express somatostatin receptors. Originally called carcinoid tumours, these tumours are rising in incidence. In patients with incurable disease, several systemic options have demonstrated activity but few have been compared in prospective, randomised controlled trials (RCTs). 177Lu-Octreotate peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and CAPTEM have shown promising activity in initial single arm trials. Prospective RCTs are needed to build on these early trials to determine the optimal role of these therapies in clinical practice.\n\nCONTROL NETs is a parallel group phase II randomised open label trial of Lutetium-177 Octreotate (177Lu-Octreotate (Lutate)) peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) and capecitabine (CAP)/temozolomide (TEM) chemotherapy (chemotherapy): (i) versus CAPTEM alone in the treatment of low to intermediate grade pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs); (ii) versus PRRT alone in the treatment of low to intermediate grade midgut neuroendocrine tumours (mNETs).\n\nGeneral aim\n\ni) To determine the relative activity of CAPTEM/PRRT in biopsy-proven, low to intermediate grade, unresectable, metastatic 68Ga-octreotate PET-avid NETs in the following parallel phase II studies: Group A: pNETs and Group B: mNETs.\n\nii) To inform future comparative phase III RCTs to determine the optimal therapies in pNETs and mNETs.\n\nDesign\n\nTwo parallel non-comparative group randomised, controlled, multi-centre phase II, 2 arm open-label controlled trials with 2:1 allocation (experimental : control)\n\n1. Study A: pNETs: PRRT/CAPTEM vs. CAPTEM (control)\n2. Study B: mNETs: PRRT/CAPTEM vs. PRRT (control)\n\nRandomisation will be performed using the method of minimisation.\n\nPatients will be stratified by:\n\n* Previous systemic therapy regimens (0,1 v 2)\n* WHO tumour grade: Low Grade - G1 (Ki67\\<3% (mitotic count \\<2)) vs. Intermediate Grade - G2 (Ki67 3-20% (mitotic count 2-20))\n* visceral only vs. visceral with bone metastases\n* Treating institution\n\nPopulation\n\nThe target population for this study is consenting adult patients with advanced, unresectable low or intermediate grade (Ki-67\\<20%) midgut neuroendocrine tumours (mNETs) or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (pNETs ), who have received ≤ 2 prior systemic therapies for advanced unresectable disease (including long acting somatostatin analogues).\n\nAssessments\n\n* Patients will be assessed at each treatment cycle for toxicity\n* CT including a 3 phase contrast CT of the liver will be undertaken at baseline, then every 2 months (pNET) or every 4 months (pNET) until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1.\n* 68Ga-DOTATATE PET CT Scan will be undertaken at baseline, then every 4 months until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1.\n* 18F-FDG PET Scan may be performed at the discretion of treating clinician at baseline, then every 2 months until radiologic progression by RECIST v1.1) for G2 NETS.\n* 24-h whole-body planar gamma imaging will be undertaken on the day after administration of PRRT (every 2 months).\n* Serum biomarkers will be undertaken every 4 months until disease progression.\n* Quality of life assessments will be undertaken at every 2 months until disease progression using QLC C30 and QLQ-GINET21.\n* Health utilities will be evaluated with EQ-5D-5L every 2 months until completion of study follow up.\n\nStatistical considerations\n\nBoth studies are based on a Simon's two-stage design and are randomised using a 2:1 randomisation (Experimental: Control). A mix of approximately 30% G1 patients and 70% G2 patients is expected.\n\nStudy A, pNETs (n=90) will have 80% power with 95% confidence interval to exclude a 12 months PFS of 60% in favour of a more interesting rate of 77% in the experimental arm.\n\nFor Study B, mNETs (n=75), the PFS at 24 months in the control arm is expected to be 52%. Thus study B will have 80% power with 95% confidence interval to demonstrate a PFS rate at 24 months of 70% in experimental arm, a result that would warrant further investigation.\n\nA total sample size of 165 patients for the two studies will be accrued over 2 years.\n\nPatients will be followed up for a minimum of 2 years.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial investigates how well oral cryotherapy plus acupressure and acupuncture compared with oral cryotherapy alone work in decreasing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with gastrointestinal cancer who are receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Acupressure is the application of pressure or localized massage to specific sites on the body to control symptoms such as pain or nausea. Acupuncture is the technique of inserting thin needles through the skin at specific points on the body to control pain and other symptoms. Cryotherapy uses cold temperature such as oral ice chips to prevent abnormally increased pain sensation. Giving oral cryotherapy with acupressure and acupuncture may work better in decreasing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy from oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with gastrointestinal cancer compared to oral cryotherapy alone.",
