These patients will demonstrate the ability of the MOT to prospectively collect data using the same protocol and related documents, standardized data elements and processes, and accepted scientific endpoints; and (2) Analysis Cohorts. The modular nature of the study allows collection of RWD ranging from diagnosis only to the full treatment course of the of the patient. Patients are grouped to allow focused data collection or a specific analysis. Analysis cohorts can be created from patients already enrolled in ROOT or be defined prospectively. Because of the ongoing advancements of molecular based oncology, this trial allows a detailed focus on molecular testing as part of any cohort.\n\nData is reported by the group that is most qualified to provide this information and is proved, at point of care, using standardized data elements and processes. Physicians will report diagnosis, molecular characteristics, staging, disease burden, significant comorbidities, treatment response, and medical decision making. Molecular testing (reports and details) will be requested from testing laboratories. Any diagnostic films will be received digitally from the location the study was performed. Research staff assist in data entry and providing physicians needed data as part of the regular workflow to allow point-of-care reporting.\n\nThe Validation Cohorts and Analysis Cohorts may run sequentially or in parallel with each other.",

CTC is believed to be a crucial step in cancer spreading to the bloodstream and giving rise to metastases. Detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) specifically adds specificity to the analysis of the CTC.\n\nThe investigators would like to with molecular biological methods predict which patients requires special monitoring and individualized therapy and explore these tests as clinical decision support.\n\nPurpose and method\n\nIn a blood sample from patients with neuro-endocrine tumor (NET) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the investigators will by cell separation, flow cytometry and DNA sequencing and digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR):\n\n1. Identify and isolate the CTC and investigate these for tumor-specific mutations.\n2. Quantify ctDNA and analyze this for specific mutations, which in the past has been found frequent in NET and HCC.\n3. Compare findings of mutations on CTC and ctDNA with mutations in tissue biopsies.\n\nThe results are compared with the clinical data on disease course, including the effect of treatment and survival.\n\nSubjects 40 Patients with small intestinal/unknown primary NET before treatment with somatostatin analogues 30 patients with pancreatic NET before treatment with Everolimus 30 patients with presumed radically treated HCC 30 patients with HCC in treatment with Sorafenib A blood sample will be taken prior to the start of treatment, after 1 month after start of treatment and thereafter every 3.-6. month for up to two years.\n\nPerspectives In several cancer types molecular diagnostics have had significant influence in treatment and control strategy. The goal is in future to be able to take advantage of a so-called \"liquid biopsy\" as clinical decision support. The study will bring new knowledge to this growing field of research.",

      "brief_summary": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of concomitant main pancreatic duct exposure, repair, or reconstruction during minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation on long-term patient prognosis and quality of life.",
      "detailed_description": "Standard surgical procedures for benign or low-grade malignant pancreatic tumors is associated with increased risks of postoperative complications and long-term pancreatic functional impairment, while parenchyma-sparing pancreatectomy such as enucleation can reduce the incidence of complications and preserve healthy parenchyma, thereby preserve both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic function. It has been reported that pancreatic tumor enucleation is a safe and feasible approach in preserving normal physiological function in patients undergoing pancreatic surgery.\n\nWith the growing emphasis on routine screenings and the application of high-quality thin-slice imaging techniques, the detection rates of pancreatic tumors have witnessed a steady increase. Additionally, there is a notable trend towards younger patients being diagnosed with pancreatic tumors. Consequently, in conjunction with ensuring safe and thorough tumor resection while maximizing preservation of pancreatic function, there is a current clinical demand to further reduce surgical trauma.\n\nLiterature reviews and meta-analyses have demonstrated that minimally invasive enucleation procedures offer well-known advantages associated with minimally invasive approaches, such as shorter postoperative hospital stays and lower overall complication rates. While the occurrence rate of severe complications, such as postoperative hemorrhage, remains relatively low, the development of postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) continues to pose a challenging issue.\n\nThe distance between the tumor and the main pancreatic duct (MPD) is considered a crucial factor influencing the occurrence of POPF after enucleation. However, these data have been rarely described in previous studies, making it challenging to accurately assess their actual impact on the rate of POPF occurrence. Heeger et al. suggested that the risk of POPF increases with closer proximity of the tumor to the MPD. The incidence of POPF was higher in deep-seated tumors after pancreatic enucleation (distance to MPD \\<3 mm) compared to superficial tumors (\\>3 mm) (73.3% vs. 30.0%, P=0.002). Other studies have even limited this critical distance to 2mm. Some research has indicated that if the tumor invades or encases the MPD, enucleation surgery should be contraindicated, and standard resection should be preferred to avoid the risk of POPF postoperatively. However, a retrospective analysis by Strobel et al. on 166 cases of pancreatic tumor enucleation demonstrated that even tumors in close proximity to the MPD can be safely resected, although their study did not include cases with tumor encasement of the MPD.\n\nDuring the expansive growth of solid tumors such as neuroendocrine tumors and solid pseudopapillary neoplasms, they can compress the MPD, causing inflammatory adhesions. Cystic tumors can also surround the MPD as they grow. Enucleation of these tumors may inevitably lead to exposure, injury, or transection of the MPD, necessitating repair and reconstruction. Recent years have seen successful cases reported of end-to-end anastomosis of the MPD. Minimally invasive techniques have also facilitated the promotion of MPD repair or bridging reconstruction surgeries. However, there remains a lack of comprehensive research data in this field.\n\nThe safety and feasibility of minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation procedures involving MPD exposure, repair, or reconstruction, the control of POPF, and the long-term prognosis and quality of life of patients after MPD repair or reconstruction remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a prospective cohort study. The results of this study will serve as a valuable reference for clinical practice and promote the development and application of minimally invasive pancreatic tumor enucleation procedures.",

With the increasing adoption of MIEN, there is an urgent need for a predictive model to guide the treatment and prognosis of POPF. Therefore, this study aims to conduct a cohort study, with data prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. The result of this study will provide a valuable reference for the development and application of MIEN.",

      "brief_summary": "Background: Liver metastases are common in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms, but often underestimated by preoperative imaging. Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) is the reference standard for staging of primary and metastatic liver tumors, with a diagnostic accuracy superior to that of CT and MRI. Rationale: The present study aims to evaluate the contribution of IOUS to staging of liver disease in patients with neuroendocrine tumor candidates for primary tumor resection classified as cM0 at preoperative imaging.\n\nThe study will collect a prospective series of 99 patients undegoing surgery for gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at the Humanitas Clinical Institute (coordinating centre) or at one of the participating centres in the period 2020-2023. All patients had to be cM0 tumor at preoperative imaging. Additional inclusion criteria: age\\>18 years, ability to give the informed consent for study participation; no other malignancies in the previous 5 years; preoperative staging including abdominal CT and DOTATOC PET-CT performed ≤60 days before surgery.\n\nThis prospective observational multicentre study aims to elucidate the proportion of patients with gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor cM0 at preoperative imaging that have intraoperative detection of liver metastases at IOUS.\n\nPrimary endpoint:\n\n- Performances of IOUS in identifying liver metastases in patients with neuroendocrine tumor classified as cM0 at preoperative imaging\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\n* Impact of IOUS on the therapeutic strategy\n* Performances of preoperative imaging (CT, MRI and PET-CT) in comparison with those of IOUS\n\nThe study will collect a prospective series of 99 patients undergoing surgery for gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor at the Humanitas Clinical Institute (coordinating centre) or at one of the participating centres in the period 2020-2023.\n\nThe study includes the following steps:\n\nPreoperative / enrollment: All patients candidates to resection of gastro-intestinal or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor will be considered for the study. Only cM0 patients will be enrolled. All patients enrolled in the study must have performed a preoperative abdominal CT scan with contrast medium and a DOTATOC-PET-CT (both performed ≤60 days before surgery).\n\nIntraoperative: During surgery, the investigator will perform, as standard in our clinical practice, an accurate exploration of the liver by inspection, palpation and IOUS. The investigator will record the identification of any liver lesion. If one or more nodules suspect of being neuroendocrine liver metastases are identified, it will be necessary, whenever possible, as already routinely performed, to carry out a biopsy or to remove it (if superficial) for histological confirmation of the diagnosis. After completion of liver staging, the primary tumor will be resected.\n\nPostoperative / follow-up: Enrolled patients will have standard postoperative management.\n\nStandard statistical analyses will be performed. Per-patient and per-lesion analyses will be performed to asses performances of preoperative imaging modalities (CT, MRI, PET-CT) and of intraoperative ones (inspection, palpation, and IOUS).",

Eligible patients who have provided their written informed consent for study participation will be assigned to one of 7 cohorts determined by indication:\n\n* Cohort 1: Rare sarcoma\n* Cohort 2: Rare ovarian cancer\n* Cohort 3: Primary central nervous system lymphomas\n* Cohort 4: Rare thyroid cancer\n* Cohort 5: Rare malignant neuroendocrine cancer\n* Cohort 6: Germ-cell cancer\n* Cohort 7: NK/T-cell lymphoma\n\nBetween 20 and 50 patients will be enrolled in each cohort with the exception of the cohort 1 for which up to 80 patients may be enrolled (extension introduced under amendment 5 of this protocol). Following the amendment 6, up to a maximum of 50 additional patients may be included in the Sarcoma (cohort 1), Rare ovarian cancer (cohort 2) or Primary central nervous system lymphoma (cohort 3) cohorts, within the limit of 350 patients to be included in total.\n\nThe study will use a two-stage Bayesian enrichment design. The first stage treats all patients from the different cohorts with the investigational product and identifies possibly sensitive indications. The second stage will compare outcomes among subsets of patients in the identified cohorts to distinguish between subpopulations of patients who may benefit from the treatment and patients for whom there is no evidence of efficacy.\n\nAll participants who reach the maximum treatment duration per protocol and stop the pembrolizumab with a clinical benefit (prolonged stable disease, partial or complete response), may be eligible for up to an additional 1 year (approximately 17 cycles) of pembrolizumab treatment if they progress during the follow-up period. This retreatment is termed the Second course or Re-challenge.\n\nThe second pembrolizumab course will continue until 12 months of retreatment, progression or until the end of the study, whichever occurs first.",

      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of different surgical resections (R0, R1, R2) on circulating NET transcripts (PCR score or NETest). A drop in circulating NET levels will be correlated with surgical excision. Secondly, variation of circulating NET transcripts will be correlated to NET recurrence to test whether this analysis may constitute an early predictive marker of disease relapse.",
      "detailed_description": "Biomarker-based tools that can accurately predict gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) treatment response and tumor recurrence are currently not available. Circulating biomarkers that are associated with GEP-NETs are limited to measurements of plasma chromogranin A (CgA). The investigators have developed a PCR-based tool to quantitate (score) the circulating GEP-NET molecular signature (\"liquid\" biopsy) with high sensitivity and specificity. This signature can identify all types of GEP-NETs including small (1cm) non-metastatic tumors, is significantly reduced after tumor debulking and is decreased following surgical \"cure\". Elevated post-surgical scores are associated with tumor recurrence within 6 months in \\~40% of cases. Current NET treatment protocols are associated with tumor recurrence (progression free survival) ranging from 5-18 months. The majority of patients will experience a relapse within 18 months irrespective of the treatment approach. The investigators hypothesize that a PCR measurement of circulating NET mRNA can accurately predict the extent of surgical resection (tumor removal) and elevated scores can predict tumor relapse before this occurs. This biomarker protocol seeks to test this hypothesis and evaluate whether changes in plasma CgA are as effective in predicting resection and recurrence.",

Current grading of neuroendocrine tumors are based on the 2010 WHO classification. This classifies grade 3 tumors as the neuroendocrine tumor with mitosis \\> 20 per 10 high power field or Ki-67 labeling index \\> 20%. Etoposide-based chemotherapy, mostly as the combination with cisplatin, has been the mainstay of the treatment for patients with grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors. However, a recent large retrospective analysis has suggested this regimen may not be effective in relatively low Ki-67 labeling index. Therefore, the investigators designed a clinical trial testing temozolomide-capecitabine combination, which has been mostly investigated in well differentiated (ie., grade 1 or 2) neuroendocrine tumors, in patients with grade 3 and low Ki-67 gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.",

Patients who have not responded to standard treatments will be included, and treatment will last for up to 12 months. The study will assess objective response, progression-free survival, and biomarkers such as PD-L1, ctDNA, and microvesicles, in a multicenter collaborative effort to provide innovative therapeutic options for this underrepresented population",
      "detailed_description": "The ANTARES study is a phase II \"basket\" trial designed to evaluate the tissue-agnostic efficacy of the monoclonal anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab, in patients with advanced or metastatic rare tumors. A \"basket\" trial is an innovative type of clinical trial where patients with different types of cancers, but sharing a common molecular feature (in this case, PD-L1 expression), are treated with the same therapy, regardless of the tumor's site of origin. This approach allows for the evaluation of treatments targeting specific molecular characteristics, independent of the primary cancer type.\n\nRare tumors, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), have an incidence of fewer than six cases per 100,000 people per year. Although each rare cancer type is individually uncommon, collectively they account for 25-30% of all malignancies and are often underrepresented in clinical trials due to recruitment challenges and limited funding. As a result, patients with rare cancers generally have a poorer prognosis compared to those with more common tumors.\n\nIn this study, patients with advanced or refractory rare malignancies expressing PD-L1, with a combined positive score (CPS) of ≥10, will be treated with nivolumab. Treatment will be administered until disease progression or for a maximum duration of 12 months, aiming to assess the efficacy and safety of this tissue-agnostic immunotherapy approach. Efficacy will be measured according to RECIST v1.1 criteria, with objective response as the primary endpoint. Additionally, the study will assess response biomarkers, including PD-L1, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), and microvesicles, to better understand the correlation between biomarker expression and clinical outcomes.\n\nThis multicenter trial, with an estimated duration of four years, will be conducted at Institute of Cancer of the State of São Paulo (ICESP) and other partner institutions. The study aims to overcome existing barriers in rare cancer treatment by offering an innovative approach that explores the potential of personalized therapies based on molecular characteristics, rather than the tumor's primary site",

      "brief_summary": "Lu-DOTA-TATE (Lutetium-177 octreotate) is a radiopharmaceutical that has been reported as being effective in controlling symptoms and increase quality of life; induce stable disease and extend progression free survival; induce a (good) partial remission and induce a complete remission in patients with a somatostatin receptor positive tumour.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Lu-DOTA-TATE by measuring progression free survival and overall survival. This study will also asses the safety of Lu-DOTA-TATE, and the quality of life of the patients treated with Lu-DOTA-TATE.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine (NET) tumours have secretory and metabolic pathways not typically found in other cancers that can be utilized for molecular imaging and therapeutic targeting. The most important is somatostatin. Somatostatin receptors are useful tools in the diagnosis and treatment of NET tumours because the somatostatin analogue octreotate can be radiolabeled with lutetium-177 for imaging and therapy.\n\nIn selected populations of patients, radioisotope therapy in expert hands has been shown to be a safe and effective palliative therapy with stable disease, progression free survival benefit, symptom control and improvements in quality of life. Lutetium-177 (DOTA0, Tyr3) octreotate has been used in a significant number of clinical studies shown to be safe and effective as a therapeutic agent in patients with NET tumours. The investigators intend to further confirm these benefits with lutetium-177 octreotate, which could form the basis for a national registry study leading to registration of this therapeutic intervention.",

The mainstay treatment of PanNENs is surgery, which is associated with a significant benefit in term of survival but also with significant short- and long-term adverse events.\n\nBased on the above data, less invasive alternative therapeutic interventions to avoid short- and long-term adverse events of surgery are needed.\n\nIn this context radiofrequency ablation has been reported to be effective in the treatment of these tumors in absence of major adverse events.

      "condition": "Gastrointestinal Cancer; Neuroendocrine Tumours; Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm",
      "intervention": "Ipilimumab; Nivolumab",
      "brief_summary": "The three tumour streams that will be studied in this protocol are: (i) upper GI malignancies (comprising intra-hepatic/extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal cancers).); (ii) neuroendocrine tumours (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and (iii) rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours).\n\nThe role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.\n\nThis protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of nivolumab \\& ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.",
      "detailed_description": "This is a phase 2 clinical trial of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with rare cancers. This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab. If the safety profile is acceptable and clinically efficacy is seen, this study would support the use of nivolumab combined with ipilimumab in subjects with these cancers.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, they are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. The rare care project has defined a rare malignancy as a cancer with an incidence of less than 6/100000/year. It is estimated that 42,000 people are diagnosed with a form of rare or less common cancer in Australia every year (www.canceraustralia.gov.au). The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of these patients. Given the recent success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a whole range of different cancer types, it can be postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. It is proposed here that patient cohorts which fall within three distinct tumour streams will be examined, with all patients receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy. The three tumour streams are defined as: upper GI malignancies (comprising intra-hepatic/ extra-hepatic cholangiocarcinomas,gall bladder cancers and duodenal cancers).); neuroendocrine tumours (inc. Pancreatic, bronchial and intestinal carcinoid tumours) and rare gynaecological tumours (including but will not be limited to: vaginal or vulval carcinomas, clear cell carcinoma of the ovary, low grade serous ovarian cancer, mixed mullarian tumours (carcinosarcoma), sarcomas of the female genital tract and granulosa cell tumours). Although overall response rates for individual tumour types will not be established due to sample size (target 20 patients per tumour stream, n=60 total), descriptive information of individual patient responses will guide immune-directed therapies to responsive rare tumour types and may be broadened to tumour streams.",

If an insufficient amount of tumour tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site is available prior to the start of the screening phase, subjects must consent to allow the acquisition of additional tumour tissue for performance of biomarker analyses.\n   * Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained within 14 days prior to randomization:\n\n     * WBC (white blood cells) \\> or = to 2000/μL\n     * Neutrophils \\> or = to 1500/μL\n     * Platelets \\> or = to 100 x103/μL\n     * Hemoglobin \\> 9.0 g/dL\n     * Serum creatinine \\< or = to 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) 40 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)\n     * AST/ALT (aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase) \\< or = to 3 x ULN\n     * Total Bilirubin \\< or = to 1.5 x ULN (Upper limit of normal) (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin \\< 3.0 mg/dL).\n   * Subject Re-enrolment: This study permits the re-enrolment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (i.e. subject has not been treated) after obtaining agreement from the medical monitor prior to re enrolling a subject. If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.\n3. Age and Reproductive Status\n\n   * Men and women, \\> or = to 18 years of age\n   * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception.

Lu-177 Dotatate, targeting somatostatin receptors, is an internal vectorized radiotherapy using Lu-177, an ideal radionuclide for peptide radionuclide therapy. In NETTER-1 phase III randomized clinical trial, Lu-177 Dotatate proved its superiority in increasing progression free survival for midgut neuroendocrine tumors. This study hypothesize that finding biomarkers of individual radio sensitivity for this type of internal vectorized therapy would allow treatment personalization. The protocol aim at studying transcript variations induced by this therapy.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well stereotactic body radiation therapy with or without nivolumab works in treating patients with stage I-IIA non-small cell lung cancer or cancer that has come back. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy and nivolumab may work better at treating non-small cell lung cancer.",

      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare neoplasms, but with increasing incidence and prevalence in the last decades. Although they may manifest in the most diverse tissues, the vast majority of cases will affect organs of the digestive tract and lung. At diagnosis, more than half of the cases present metastatic disease, and among patients with localized disease, up to one-third will have recurrence of the disease. Unfortunately, the minority of patients with metastatic disease are eligible for curative intent. Although there are many types of NET, they are often studied together as a group because their cells share common histological findings, have special secretory granules, and the ability to secrete bioactive amines and polypeptide hormones. Approximately 25 percent of the tumors present functional hormonal syndromes (situation of great morbidity for these patients), being the carcinoid syndrome, the most common one. From the molecular point of view, these neoplasias are largely dependent on the activation of the mTOR pathway and neoangiogenesis. Another striking feature of neuroendocrine cells is the expression of cell surface hormone receptors whose activation or blockade may exert an important regulatory function. The discovery of somatostatin, and consequently its receptors, is one of the major advances in the treatment of this neoplasm. Due to the increased ability of somatostatin to inhibit the secretion of several hormones, its antitumor property has long been studied. However, only after the development of synthetic long-life formulations can their use be used in clinical practice. Well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (G1 and G2 according to World Health Organization (WHO) classification) present in more than 80 percent of somatostatin receptor cases. In this population, the use of somatostatin analogues promotes symptomatic improvement of functioning syndromes in the order of 70 to 77 percent and biochemical improvement around 50 percent . Regarding antiproliferative activity, two phase III studies evaluated the role of octreotide LAR and of lanreotide autogel, both somatostatin analogs, in the population of well differentiated tumors and, almost entirely, somatostatin receptor hyperexpressors when evaluated by octreoscan. In these studies, the use of somatostatin analogue was associated with reduced risk of progression or death from 53 percent to 66 percent when compared to placebo. Currently, this class of drugs is often considered as the first treatment option for patients with progressing metastatic disease, when the strategy of watchful waiting is not opted for (because they are tumors of sometimes indolent behavior, some cases are selected for observation only). In general, there are few options for systemic therapies that are approved for these tumors in addition to somatostatin analogs (mTOR and antiangiogenic inhibitors), none of which clearly demonstrate overall survival gain, are costly and none are available for use in the public health system (SUS). Therefore, it is very important to develop studies with new therapies for patients with NET, especially, molecularly defined therapies with greater access to patients. In this context, other anti-hormonal therapies could be explored in patients with NET, such as the role of the sex hormones estrogen and progesterone, as well as their receptors. A few studies have evaluated the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in NET and suggest interesting results. One of the largest series was conducted at the AC Camargo Cancer Center where the immunohistochemical expression of these receptors was evaluated in 96 patients with NET from various sites. About 35 percent of the cases presented positivity for some hormonal receptor (HR) in the tumor tissue. Among the HR positive cases, there was no difference between sex, more frequent in thin, pancreatic and lung tumors and in well differentiated tumors (G1 and G2 by the WHO). Viale et al. Evaluated the expression of progesterone receptors (PR) in 96 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Nuclear immunoreactivity for PR was observed in 58 percent of cases, with no difference in PR expression according to gender, age, or functioning syndromes. About 163 primary tumors of the gastroenteropancreatic site and 115 metastases were evaluated by Zimmermann and colleagues for expression of female hormone receptors. Progesterone receptor was more frequently found in pancreatic tumors and rarely in non-pancreatic (p \\<0.001), estrogen receptor was more frequently expressed in non-pancreatic tumors (\\<0.001) and in women (p: 0.019). There was no difference between primary site and presence of metastases. Apparently, HR positive tumors may present a more favorable evolution. A study evaluated 160 patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors operated for expression by PTEN immunohistochemistry (negative regulator of the mTOR pathway) and PR. Approximately 69 percent of the cases were positive for PR and PTEN, 28 percent were positive for one of the two markers and only 3 percent were negative for both. Combined positivity for PTEN and PR was associated with metastasis-free survival in stages I and II (p \\<0.001) and overall survival in all patients (p \\<0.001), even after adjustment for other prognostic variables. Patients with negative PR and PTEN tumors had the shorter survival times when compared to those who had only one or both markers (p \\<0.001). 9 Similarly, other author demonstrated a retrospective analysis of 277 patients with neuroendocrine tumors (95 percent vs. 76 percent, p \\<0.05), and a higher survival rate (p \\<0.05) than in the control group (p \\<0.05) 0.015). Even rarer in the literature is the role of antiestrogen therapies as a form of control of this neoplasia. Case reports point to antiproliferative activity of tamoxifen in patients with NET and, in some cases, patients presenting more than 12 months of disease control.11 Reports of control of carcinoid syndrome and even regression of associated retroperitoneal fibrosis have also been described. However, the only study to assess the activity of tamoxifen in neuroendocrine tumors dates back to 1984. Sixteen patients were evaluated clinical benefit in only 19 percent of cases and no radiological response. However, in this study, no patient was previously selected for HR tumor expression or degree of differentiation, which the investigators believe limited benefit in disease control. Therefore, based on the premise that there is a need for research and treatment strategies for this rare neoplasm; there is clear therapeutic embezzlement in the public heath system due to the high cost of the treatments approved in the country for this neoplasia; NET are tumors that may present positivity to estrogen and / or progesterone receptors; evidence points to the possibility of antiproliferative effect using hormonal therapy, the investigators propose a phase II study of tamoxifen for patients with well differentiated NET and positive for HR, estrogen and / or progesterone expression.",

      "detailed_description": "When patients are suspected of having neuroendocrine tumours, they will usually undergo various imaging scans such as computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and octreotide scintigraphy (octreoscan) to try to identify the primary tumour. During the patients' course of disease, they will continue to have various CT, MRI, and/or octreoscans. Sometimes, despite using scans, laboratory tests, and examination, it is still difficult to properly diagnose neuroendocrine tumours.\n\nDoctors have found that most neuroendocrine tumours make too much of a hormone called somatostatin on their cell surface. Because of this doctors have been using positron emission tomography (PET) scans using a special contrast dye called 68Ga-DOTATATE in hopes of better diagnosing and managing neuroendocrine tumours. 68Ga-DOTATATE can label the cells that have somatostatin (such as neuroendocrine tumour cells) so that the PET scan can take better pictures and doctors can better diagnose and manage the disease.\n\nHowever, despite 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans showing promise, it is still not widely accessible. Because of this, researchers are creating a registry for patients who may need 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans to:\n\n* Identify their primary tumour where the doctor suspects is a neuroendocrine tumour\n* Staging of the neuroendocrine tumour\n* Restage the tumour prior to surgery/radiotherapy or help to assess the tumour where standard scans such as CTs, MRIs, or octreoscans are not properly showing your tumours despite other clinical or laboratory tests showing that your disease has progressed\n* For other issues when confirmation of site of disease and/or disease extent may impact clinical management of the neuroendocrine tumour.\n\nThis registry help the participant's treating physician to obtain approval for the participant to undergo 68Ga-DOTATATE PET scans for their neuroendocrine tumour.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n* Able to undergo PET/CT without sedation\n* Any of the following indications:\n\n  * Group A. Identification of primary tumor: For the initial diagnosis of patients with clinical (e.g., signs, symptoms) and/or biochemical (e.g., tumor markers) suspicion of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) but for whom conventional imaging is negative or equivocal or for whom biopsy is not easily obtained.\n  * Group B. Staging: For the staging of patients with localized primary NETs and/or limited metastasis where definitive surgery is planned.\n  * Group C. Restaging: Restaging of patients with NET where surgery or peptide-receptor radiotherapy (PRRT) is being considered; OR, where conventional imaging is negative or equivocal at time of clinical and/or biochemical progression.\n  * Group D. As a problem-solving tool: As a problem-solving tool in patient with NET when confirmation of site of disease and/or disease extent may impact clinical management.\n* Approved by a review panel if Group D.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Inability to provide informed consent.\n* Contraindication for PET examination as per institutional safety guidelines, including but not limited to pregnancy, or inability to lie still for PET examination.\n* Need for full sedation to undergo PET/CT scan.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and temozolomide work in treating patients with small-cell lung cancer that has come back or does not respond to treatment, or neuroendocrine cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nivolumab and temozolomide may work better in treating patients with small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the efficacy (using response rate per RECIST v1.1) of nivolumab and temozolomide for the treatment of patients with either small cell lung cancer that have progressed or recurred after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and immunotherapy (cohort 1), or progressive metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma of any grade or primary site in any line of therapy (cohort 2).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To evaluate the safety profile and toxicity of combination nivolumab and temozolomide as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v.) 5.0.\n\nII. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients treated with combination nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIII. To evaluate the central nervous system (CNS) PFS of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nEXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine whether treatment with nivolumab and temozolomide leads to a decrease in immune-suppressive cell populations (ie myeloid-derived suppressor cells \\[MDSC\\]) in peripheral blood.\n\nII. To determine whether objective response rate (ORR), PFS, OS vary by tumor O6-methylguanine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation at baseline.\n\nIII. To determine whether baseline tumor mutational burden is predictive of response to therapy in patients with SCLC treated with nivolumab and temozolomide.\n\nIV. To determine whether changes in blood based mutation burden during treatment may predict clinical benefit.\n\nV. To determine whether a composite immune and tumor cell staining score can be developed with or without PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to predict response in the SCLC cohort.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 of a 28 day cycle. Patients also receive temozolomide orally (PO) on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks for 12 months, then every 12 weeks thereafter.",

Preliminary data suggested that overnight 5HIAA value may be representative of 24-hour 5HIAA value, and that plasma 5HIAA dosage could be a valuable alternative to urine 5HIAA dosage. The main objective of this study is to compare sensitivity and specificity of overnight 5HIAA value, 24-hour 5HIAA value and plasma 5HIAA value, in patients with small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors.",

      "brief_summary": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare but their incidence is growing. Alkylating agents (ALKY) are one of the main systemic treatments used, at least for advanced duodeno-pancreatic NETs, with a response rate of 30 to 40% and a median progression-free survival of 4 to 18 months. Chemotherapy is one of the few therapeutic weapons, along with everolimus, somatostatin analogs, and metabolic radiotherapy, for lung NETs, called typical and atypical carcinoids, even if the level of proof of efficacy for these treatments is lower than for duodeno-pancreatic NETs. Considering the available retrospective data, O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) appears to be a predictive factor of the response to ALKY. Oxaliplatin (OX) has demonstrated an interesting activity, with response rates between 17% and 30%. In a first retrospective study we showed that Gemox is effective in NET, and more recently that its activity is similar to that of ALKYs, but without being influenced by the MGMT status. Prospective studies are needed but our data suggests that ALKY should be offered first to patients with methylated MGMT tumors while Oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy should be offered first to patients with unmethylated MGMT tumors.\n\nIn this project, we wish to evaluate the contribution of the MGMT methylation, evaluated in the tumor, in predicting the Objective Response (OR) in patients treated with ALKY and to evaluate a treatment with alkylating agents versus Oxaliplatin in patients with a duodeno-pancreatic or lung or unknown primitive NET.",

Mismatch repair protein deficient (MSI-H) cancers (excluding colorectal carcinoma).\n\nThe role of immunotherapy is being defined in more common cancer types, however because of their rarity, the efficacy of immunotherapy for these cancers is poorly defined.\n\nThis protocol provides an important opportunity to establish whether the combination of nivolumab \\& ipilimumab has efficacy in these cancers.",

This study will allow an evaluation of the clinical benefit, as measured by progression free survival (PFS) \\>6 months and overall survival (OS), provided by nivolumab combined with ipilimumab.\n\nStudy Rationale Clinically advanced rare cancers pose a significant clinical challenge because evidence based treatments are seldom available for patients suffering from these malignancies. Despite little evidence that shows clinical benefit, these patients are often treated with chemotherapeutic agents that are used in patients with more common malignancies that arise from the same anatomical site. Furthermore, because of small numbers, patients are often excluded from clinical trials with newer agents. CA209-538 examined this treatment combination in three 'baskets' of rare cancers: rare upper gastrointestinal, gynaecological and neuroendocrine cancers. The cancers on study all individually had an incidence of \\<2/100000/year. The cancer specific survival of patients diagnosed with a rare malignancy is significantly lower than with common cancers highlighting the need to improve management and treatment of rare cancer patients. Given the success of cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint regulators such as ipilimumab and nivolumab in a range of different cancer types, it was postulated that these agents could be beneficial in rare cancers and improve the overall outlook of patients with these conditions. CA209-538 enrolled 120 rare cancer patients on study, clinical benefit rate was \\>30% across all baskets, long term survival follow-up is underway.\n\nThis study will enrol 240 participants, across 4 cohorts with histotypes which demonstrated clinical benefit on CA209-538. All participants will receive ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination immunotherapy.",
      "eligibility_criteria": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1. Signed Written Informed Consent\n\n   * Subjects must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment schedule, laboratory testing, and other requirements of the study\n2. Target Population\n\n   * a) Histologically confirmed Neuroendocrine cancers: Atypical bronchial carcinoid, neuroendocrine carcinoma and Grade 3 NETs independent of primary site (SCLC excluded); Biliary Tract Cancers: Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder carcinoma; Gynaecological malignancies: Ovarian clear cell carcinoma, uterine clear cell carcinoma, uterine/ovarian carcinosarcoma, uterine leiomyosarcoma, vaginal/vulva squamous cell carcinoma; Mismatch repair protein deficient (MSI-H) cancers (excluding colorectal carcinoma)\n   * Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1\n   * Prior systemic therapy (≤1) for advanced disease is permitted if it was completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrolment, and all related adverse events have either returned to baseline or stabilized or participants are not suitable for, or if declining established standard therapies. For MSI-H rare cancers and atypical bronchial carcinoid only, patients will be eligible independent of the number of prior lines of systemic treatment received as long as treatment has been completed at least 4 weeks prior to enrolment.\n   * Prior radiotherapy must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.\n   * Measurable disease by CT or MRI per RECIST 1.1 criteria\n   * Tumour tissue from an unresectable or metastatic site of disease must be available for biomarker analyses.\n   * Screening laboratory values must meet the following criteria and should be obtained within 14 days prior to randomization:\n\n     * WBC (white blood cells) \\> or = to 2000/μL\n     * Neutrophils \\> or = to 1500/μL\n     * Platelets \\> or = to 100 x103/μL\n     * Hemoglobin \\> 9.0 g/dL\n     * Serum creatinine \\< or = to 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance (CrCl) 40 mL/min (using the Cockcroft-Gault formula)\n     * AST/ALT (aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase) \\< or = to 3 x ULN (in the event of metastatic liver disease, an exception to this upper limit may be accepted in consultation with the study physician).\n     * Total Bilirubin \\< or = to 1.5 x ULN (Upper limit of normal) (except subjects with Gilbert Syndrome, who can have total bilirubin \\< 3.0 mg/dL).\n   * Subject Re-enrolment: This study permits the re-enrolment of a subject that has discontinued the study as a pre-treatment failure (i.e. subject has not been treated) after obtaining agreement from the medical monitor prior to re enrolling a subject. If re-enrolled, the subject must be re-consented.\n3. Age and Reproductive Status\n\n   * Men and women, \\> or = to 18 years of age\n   * Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must use method(s) of contraception. WOCBP should therefore use an adequate method to avoid pregnancy for 23 weeks (30 days plus the time required for Nivolumab to undergo five half lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.\n   * Women must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours prior to the start of investigational product.\n   * Women must not be breastfeeding\n   * Men who are sexually active with WOCBP must use any contraceptive method with a failure rate of less than 1 percent per year. Men that are sexually active with WOCBP must follow instructions for birth control when the half life of the investigational drug is greater than 24 hours, contraception should be continued for a period of 90 days plus the time required for the investigational drug to undergo five half lives. The half life of nivolumab and ipilimumab is up to 25 days and 18 days, respectively. Given the blinded nature of the study, men who are sexually active with WOCBP must continue contraception for 31 weeks (90 days plus the time required for nivolumab to undergo five half lives) after the last dose of investigational drug.\n   * Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e. who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile and azoospermic men do not require contraception.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n1.

Cases should be discussed with the medical monitor. There must also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.\n2. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases\n\n   * Prior combination treatment directed against the PD-1/PDL1 (Programmed Death Ligand 1) axis (anti PD 1, anti PD-L1, anti PD L2), and anti CTLA 4 antibody. Prior monotherapy with these agents or other immune-stimulating/regulating agents is permitted.\n   * Any serious or uncontrolled medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, may increase the risk associated with study participation or study drug administration, impair the ability of the subject to receive protocol therapy, or interfere with the interpretation of study results.\n   * Prior malignancy active within the previous 3 years except for locally curable cancers that have been apparently cured, such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.\n   * Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease. Subjects with vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.\n   * Subjects with a condition requiring systemic treatment with either corticosteroids (\\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids, and adrenal replacement doses \\> 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease.\n3. Physical and Laboratory Test Findings\n\n   * Any positive test result for hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus indicating acute or chronic infection\n   * Known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n4.

      "brief_summary": "Poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) are a sub-group of aggressive neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN). The most common primary sites are broncho-pulmonary and digestive. The gastroentero-pancreatic NECs (GEP-NEC) represent 7-21% of all of the NENs.\n\nRecent data on the initial presentation of GEP-NEC have been reported in two retrospective studies and a French cohort study. No standard second-line treatment has been defined for NECs. Despite a very negative prognosis, these NECs have a certain amount of chemosensitivity, close to that of bronchial NECs. Multiple-drug therapies such as Folfiri, or Folfox, or single drug treatments such as temozolomide are the proposed options but with a low level of proof Bevacizumab associated with a cytotoxic chemotherapy has shown promising results in well differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET), known for being hypervascular. The efficacy of bevacizumab has also been suggested in patients with NEC, but never in the context of a phase II study. Its combination with Folfiri is efficient and well tolerated in metastatic colorectal cancer. The combination Folfiri-bevacizumab potentially represents an optimized treatment compared to chemotherapy with only Folfiri. No phase II or III studies have reported results for these patients, and no on-going phase II or III trial have been identified to date.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to show that, after the failure of a first-line chemotherapy using platinum-etoposide, the combination Folfiri-bevacizumab allows significant prolongation of overall survival in adult patients with GEP-NEC.",

Our primary objective is to evaluate if there is a difference in post-treatment tumor-to-non-tumor (T/N) activity concentration ratio on SPECT/CT between the intra-arterial treated liver lobe and the intravenous treated liver lobe.",
      "detailed_description": "Rationale: The majority of neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients present with metastases, most often including liver metastases. These patients have a poorer prognosis and lower quality of life.\n\nCurrently, intravenous administered somatostatin-bound radionuclides (177Lu-dotatate) have shown to improve tumor response rates and progression free survival (PFS). Despite of the increased tumor response rate and PFS, liver metastases still remain the major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Patients with liver metastases have a worse outcome in terms of overall survival after treatment with 177Lu-dotatate compared to patients with limited or no liver metastases.\n\nObjective: to investigate the impact of intra-arterial (IA) administration of 177Lu-dotatate on the intrahepatic biodistribution in patients with NET liver metastases. Our primary objective is to evaluate if there is a difference in post-treatment tumor-to-non-tumor (T/N) activity concentration ratio on SPECT/CT between the intra-arterial treated liver lobe and the intravenous treated liver lobe.\n\nStudy design: Multicenter, interventional, block randomized, phase 2 clinical trial. We use a within-subject controlled design where the administration of 177Lu-dotatate is randomized between the right or left hepatic artery. Selective IA administration of 177Lu-dotatate allows for intra-patient comparison between IA administration (one lobe) versus IV 'administration' (the other lobe). The contralateral liver lobe and the rest of the body receive treatment by second pass IV route.\n\nStudy population: 26 patients with NET liver metastases (\\> 18 years old). Intervention: Treatment will be randomized between selective right or left hepatic artery administration of 177Lu-dotatate (Four administrations of 7.4 GBq; each via the same randomly allocated hepatic artery during angiography).\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: To assess if there is a difference in post-treatment tumor-to-non-tumor (T/N) activity concentration ratio on SPECT/CT between the intra-arterial treated liver lobe and the intravenous treated liver lobe. The T/N activity concentration will be measured on SPECT/CT. The primary endpoint will be assessed after the first treatment cycle. The T/N activity ratios of the second, third, and final treatment cycle will be assessed as secondary endpoint. Tumor response, toxicity, extrahepatic uptake and kidney uptake are secondary endpoints. Intra- and inter-patient differences will be studied.\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: As with the standard IV treatment with 177Lu-dotatate, the treatment consists of four cycles. During each cycle, patients will be admitted for 1 night and undergo physical examination, laboratory examination, angiography with administration of the treatment dose, and post-treatment imaging.

In GEP-NETs the actual surgical planning is established on the ground of preoperative morphology images (CT scan), and functional imaging using CT/PET with 68Ga-DOTA-TOC, since the high expression of somatostatin receptors (SSR) of these tumors. RGS in GEP-NETs, mainly with gamma-probes, has been not widely accepted since the low rates of sensitivity and, in particular, specificity, in discriminating tumoral/ non tumoral tissue and background ratio. This is a relevant issue in particular in detecting metastatic lymph-nodes both for small-intestine neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (Pan-NETs), where the presence of lymph-node metastases has been associated with worse long-term outcome. At present, it is not possible to distinguish whether a small lymph-node is site of metastases or not without performing frozen sections. In a previous study ex-vivo from European Institute of Oncology SI-NET presented a high uptake of a beta-emitting radiotracer, 90Y-DOTA-TOC. Five SI-NET showing SSR positivity at PET with 68Ga DOTA-TOC received 5 mCi of 90Y-DOTA-TOC the day before surgery. All the tumor samples showed high counts of radioactivity with a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 100%. These results allowed the investigators to develop a probe, which is now approved for in-vivo employment within the operating theatre. The objective of the present study is to verify in-vivo within the abdominal cavity the capability of the probe to detect 68-Ga activity within tumoral tissue thus favouring radical surgery and avoiding unnecessary demolition, in the near future. However, in the present protocol the entity of surgery will not be modified by intraoperative findings of the probe. It is reasonable to assume that results from 68Ga-DOTA-TOC might be comparable to 90Y-DOTA-TOC as radiotracer, and the detection efficacy of the probe for 68Ga could be not inferior compared to the isotope 90Y. However, while 90Y-DOTA-TOC is used as investigational drug for therapy purposes only within clinical research protocol, 68Ga-DOTA-TOC is a diagnostic radiotracer broadly used in day-to-day clinical practice since many years. Furthermore, the administration of 68Ga-DOTA-TOC can be directly injected in surgery room and thus does not require patients' admission the day before surgery.",

In gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs), it provides good long-term outcome and low recurrence rates.

      "detailed_description": "This is a feasibility study evaluating the use of 177Lutetium-octreotate in the treatment of advanced refractory Neuroendocrine Tumors.\n\nObjectives of the study:\n\n1. Primary (on a lesion basis): To assess the value of the following parameters (obtained through functional and molecular imaging) for predicting the lesion-by-lesion PRRT treatment outcome:\n\n   * 18FDG uptake on 18FDG PET/CT\n   * 68Ga-octreotate uptake on 68Ga-octreotate PET/CT\n   * Apparent diffusion coefficient on diffusion weighted MRI (for these 3 parameters, absolute values at baseline)\n   * Tumor dosimetry on post 177Lu-octreotate SPECT/CT after each cycle.\n2. Secondary (on a patient basis): To generate a patient-based response model based on the previously defined parameters.\n3. Exploratory (on a lesion basis): To assess the value of the parameters mentioned in the primary objective for predicting the lesion-by-lesion PRRT treatment outcome:\n\n   * absolute values of the three imaging parameters and their relative changes after each cycle;\n   * serial tumor dosimetry on post-177Lu-octreotate SPECT/CT after each cycle.\n\nTreatment will consist of 177Lu-octreotate injections in fixed activities of 7,4 GigaBecqurel each, given 11-13 weeks apart, injected intravenously with simultaneous infusion of an amino acid solution. (Before amino acid nephroprotection, ondansetron, methylprednisolone and metoclopramid, are given intravenously in order to prevent nausea or vomiting). Approximately 30 min after the beginning of the amino acid solution, 177Lu-octreotate is co-infused over 15-30 minutes. The amino acid infusion is continued at the same rate for 3-5 more hours (total infusion lasts 4-6 hours).\n\nIn total, 4 cycles (= injections of 177Lu-octreotate) are planned. However, the total number of administered cycles will be limited by critical organ (kidneys and bone marrow) threshold toxicities.\n\nTreatment efficacy will be assessed:\n\n* on a lesion-basis (change of longest transversal diameter).\n* on a patient-basis using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.",

      "brief_summary": "There is currently no standard treatment beyond first-line etoposide/platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with progressive poorly differentiated extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma. Therefore the treatment of patients whose disease progresses on or after this first-line treatment is an area of unmet need.\n\nCombination regimens such as irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid are a second-line treatment option currently used in Europe and world-wide for this subset of patients. However, there is currently no trial evidence supporting this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\nResults of the NAPOLI-1 phase III trial of liposomal irinotecan in the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma after gemcitabine-based therapy reported improved survival for those patients who received a combination of liposomal irinotecan with 5-FU/folinic acid compared to those patients who received 5-FU/folinic acid alone. Liposomal irinotecan has been found to show an improved distribution into tumour tissue in comparison to irinotecan, and this may have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nDocetaxel is standardly used as a second-line treatment option in patients with small cell lung cancer who have progressed on primary etoposide-platinum combination therapy. Therefore this drug could also have clinical benefit in patients with extra-pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma as the biology of the disease is similar to small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe overall aim of the NET-02 trial is to select a treatment for continuation to a Phase III trial. The intention of the trial is to determine whether liposomal irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid and docetaxel are sufficiently active in this population of patients. If both treatments are found to be efficacious, selection criteria will be applied to select a treatment to take forward.\n\n102 eligible participants will be randomised to receive either liposomal irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid given every 14 days, or docetaxel given every 21 days. Participants will be treated for a minimum of 6 months or until discontinuation of treatment as per protocol.",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies how well antiandrogen therapy (leuprolide, apalutamide, and abiraterone acetate) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) works in treating patients with prostate cancer that has come back and has spread to other parts of the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leuprolide, apalutamide, and abiraterone acetate, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. SBRT uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method can kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Giving antiandrogen therapy and SBRT may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the efficacy of combined systemic and tumor directed therapy for recurrent oligometastatic M1a,b prostate cancer patients with 1-5 metastases (exclusive of pelvic nodal N1 metastases) staged by prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Time to biochemical progression. II. Time to additional antineoplastic therapy. III. Prostate cancer specific survival. IV. Safety and tolerability. V. Assessment of health related quality of life using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) scale.\n\nCORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To determine genomic and transcriptomic features present in metastatic tumors in patients that respond to this multimodal therapy.\n\nII. To evaluate biomarkers of response using circulating tumor cells (CTCs). III. To evaluate biomarkers of response using circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA).\n\nIV. To evaluate immunophenotypes of circulating immune cells.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive a single dose of leuprolide subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and apalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and abiraterone acetate PO QD for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 months of initiation of antiandrogen therapy (ADT), patients also receive SBRT over 1, 3, or 5 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 2 -4 weeks, every 30 days for 6 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.",
