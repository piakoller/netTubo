EOC - specific criteria: Patients who progress or have stable disease during first-line treatment or who relapse within 1 month are considered to be 'platinum-refractory'. Patients who respond to primary treatment and relapse within 6 months are considered 'platinum-resistant', and patients who relapse more than 6 months after completion of initial therapy are characterized as 'platinum-sensitive'. Patients who relapse 6-12 months following the end of their initial regimen are classified as 'partially sensitive'. Platinum sensitive patients may be enrolled but must have failed or declined all other lines of FDA approved therapy\n  * High-Grade Neuroendocrine Carcinoma (HGNEC), any organ of origin, including a pathology of neuroendocrine features, in patients previously been treated with chemotherapy Although neuroendocrine tumors may be classified differently based on organ of origin, in the context of this protocol they are defined as high grade on the basis of either\n\n    1. Aggressive clinical behavior requiring previous treatment with chemotherapy even if histologic features such as the Ki67 index or mitotic rate corresponds with low or intermediate grade.\n    2. Histologic features: (a) Neuroendocrine tumors of lung origin are considered high grade if in any part of the tumors, there are \\>10 mitoses/2mm2 or 10 high power field (HPF). Large zones of necrosis are usually present. This includes small cell lung carcinoma and large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma. \\[SCLC will not enroll in the HGNEC cohort.\\] (b)Neuroendocrine tumors of gastroenteropancreatic origin are considered high grade if in any part of the tumors there are either \\>20 mitoses/2mm2 or 10 high power field (HPF) OR Ki67.\n* Radiographically measurable disease by RECIST v1.1\n* A washout period of 3-weeks from last treatment.\n* Patients must have previously received a platinum based regimen for advanced/metastatic disease and progressed or have platinum resistant or refractory disease defined as relapse within 6 months.\n* Age ≥18 years.\n* Life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.\n* ECOG performance status 0-2.\n* Participants must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below both prior to administration of RRx-001 and prior to administration of platinum doublet based regimen:\n\n  * Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL\n  * Platelets ≥100,000/mcL (non-transfused platelet count)\n  * Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (transfused Hgb allowed)\n  * Creatinine ≤1.5 x the upper limit of normal\n  * Total bilirubin ≤2.0 x the upper limit of normal or \\<3.0 xULN if patient has a history of Gilbert's syndrome\n  * AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤5 X institutional upper limit of normal if with liver metastases; ≤2.5 X ULN if no liver metastases\n* Patient must consent to the access, review and analysis of previous medical and cancer history, including tumor archival tissue (if available) and imaging data by the sponsor or a third party nominated by the sponsor.\n* Ability to understand and sign a written informed consent document.\n* Women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.\n\n  * Note: A woman of child-bearing potential is any female (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or Has not been postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months\n\nExclusion Criteria\n\n* Receiving concurrent investigational therapy\n* Symptomatic central nervous system metastasis (e.g., patients requiring increasing doses of steroids)\n* History of needing to permanently discontinue prior platinum doublet-based regimen for toxicity (e.g., cisplatin causing renal impairment, ototoxicity, or severe neuropathy).\n* Known severe hypersensitivity to the platinum agent (i.e., carboplatin or cisplatin) or prior partner of platinum agent (i.e., etoposide for SCC and HGNEC; nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or pemetrexed for NSCLC; paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, docetaxel or gemcitabine for ovarian) planned for the platinum therapy period. If the patient has had prior hypersensitivity reaction to the drug partner of platinum, a patient may enroll as long as it is acceptable to treat with platinum and one of the alternative chemotherapy partner agents.\n* Any significant medical diseases or conditions, as assessed by the investigators and sponsor that would substantially increase the medical risks of participating in this study (i.e., uncontrolled diabetes, NYHA II-IV congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months of study, severe chronic pulmonary disease or active uncontrolled infection, uncontrolled or clinically relevant pulmonary edema).\n* Pregnant or nursing",

      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and schedule.\n\nYou will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each cycle is 28 days.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle: questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).\n\nUrine tests will be performed every other cycle.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.\n\nAfter the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed: questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test, EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.",

      "brief_summary": "The purpose of this research study is to determine the effectiveness of AMG 479 against carcinoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. AMG 479 is an antibody that is made in the laboratory. Antibodies are highly specific proteins produced by the body's immune system that recognize foreign substances in the body. AMG 479 has been used in other research studies and information from those other research studies suggests that AMG 479 may help to prevent the growth of some neuroendocrine tumors. The observed antitumor activity of AMG 479, together with the current limited treatment options available for patients with neuroendocrine tumors, warrant further investigation of AMG 479 in this patient population.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise a heterogeneous spectrum of neoplasms. NETs are commonly subclassified into two broad subgroups according to their site of origin: pancreatic NETs are thought to arise from the endocrine cells of the pancreas, whereas NETs of other sites such as the lungs or gastrointestinal tract are often referred to as carcinoid tumors. While histologically similar, carcinoid tumors and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors have demonstrated different response rates in prior phase II studies of antitumor agents. Because of these differences, we will perform the current study using two cohorts of patients (30 with carcinoid and 30 with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors). The statistical design, however, is the same for both cohorts. With 30 patients in each cohort, this study has 80% power assuming type I error of 6% to differentiate a \\>/=17% objective response rate from a \\</=5% objective response rate using a single stage design. The proposed regimen would be promising in either cohort if at least 4 of 30 patients achieve an objective response.",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase III trial studies octreotide acetate and recombinant interferon alfa-2b to see how well it works compared to octreotide acetate and bevacizumab in treating patients with high-risk neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to other places in the body (metastatic) or spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced). Octreotide acetate and recombinant interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells and slow the growth of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving octreotide acetate together with recombinant interferon alfa-2b is more effective than giving octreotide acetate together with bevacizumab in treating patients with neuroendocrine tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare central review-based progression-free survival in poor prognosis carcinoid patients treated with either depot octreotide (octreotide acetate) plus bevacizumab, or depot octreotide plus interferon (recombinant interferon alfa-2b).\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To compare overall survival, time to treatment failure and traditionally reported progression-free survival in poor prognosis carcinoid patients treated with either depot octreotide plus bevacizumab, or depot octreotide plus interferon.\n\nII. To compare objective response (confirmed and unconfirmed complete response \\[CR\\] and partial response \\[PR\\]) in poor prognosis carcinoid patients treated with either depot octreotide plus bevacizumab, or depot octreotide plus interferon.\n\nIII. To compare the toxicity profile of patients treated with these two regimens.\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. To assess the prognostic and predictive value of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in relation to progression-free survival and treatment effect.\n\nII. To compare response of 5HIAA, chromogranin A and neuronspecific enolase among patients with elevated levels at baseline between patients treated with octreotide plus interferon versus octreotide plus bevacizumab.\n\nIII. To assess and compare the prognostic and predictive value of the combination of In-111 pentetreotide somatostatin-receptor scintigraphy (SRS) and computed tomography (CT) vs. CT in relation to progression-free survival (PFS).\n\nIV. To assess and compare the prognostic and predictive value of the combination of SRS and CT vs. CT in relation to overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF).\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\nARM I: Patients receive octreotide acetate intramuscularly (IM) and bevacizumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1.\n\nARM II: Patients receive octreotide acetate IM on day 1 and recombinant interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, and 19.\n\nTreatment in both arms repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-6 months for up to 3 years.",
