   Summary: Background:

- Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) come from cells of the hormonal and nervous systems. Some people have surgery to shrink the tumor. Sometimes the tumors come back. Researchers think that treatment with drugs based on knowing the defective gene might give better results.

Objective:

- To ...
