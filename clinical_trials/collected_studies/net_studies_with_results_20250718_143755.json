      "brief_summary": "Despite the low androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer, there is persistent AR expression observed in the majority of treatment-emergent small-cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-SCNC) biopsies. This indicates that epigenetic dysregulation leads to reprogramming away from an AR-driven transcriptional program. Therefore, continuation of AR blockade in the form of apalutamide may provide additive benefit compared to immune checkpoint blockade alone. The investigators hypothesize that the combination of apalutamide plus cetrelimab will achieve a clinically significant composite response rate with sufficient durability of response in mCRPC patients with evidence of treatment-emergent small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer",

The information obtained from this study will help the physician improve the treatment and management of patients with advanced pNET.\n\nThis study was planned to compare STZ-5FU chemotherapy followed by everolimus upon progression versus the reverse sequence. However sequential studies with pNETs are hard to be managed in terms of time and costs. Therefore the protocol was amended to have PFS1 (progression free survival after course 1) as primary endpoint and PFS2 (i.e. progression free survival after both STZ based chemotherapy and Everolimus or the reverse order) as secondary endpoint. This information will be extremely valuable for the day to day clinical practice of pNETs oncologists",

The hypothesis is that HG-NEC (excluding small cell carcinoma) can be segregated based on mutational analysis and that next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assignment of therapy is feasible and will potentially improve the outcomes.",
      "detailed_description": "Neuroendocrine tumors vary widely in both disease site and grade, ranging from low grade, relatively benign carcinoid tumors to aggressive and rapidly fatal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. High-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (HG-NECs) can originate anywhere in the body, and are highly aggressive, with dismal 5-year overall survival rates. The lung and gastrointestinal tract (small bowel, colon, rectum, or pancreas) form the majority of these HG-NECs sites. HG-NECs are classified into three subtypes based on histopathology, specifically, as small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), or poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma.\n\nThere is a lack of consensus for upfront systemic regimens for HG-NECs and as such, treatment is often per physician preference. Most often, HG-NECs are treated with platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens, with marked heterogeneity in response. It is well established that small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas are characterized by a co-mutation for TP53 and RB1, and are exceptionally platinum-sensitive. However less is known about LCNECs.\n\nLCNEC was first introduced in 1991 by Travis et. al as a new type of lung cancer. The 2015 World Health Organization Classification categorized LCNEC under neuroendocrine tumors, along with typical carcinoma, atypical carcinoma and the more undifferentiated tumor represented by small cell lung cancer. Prior to 2015, LCNEC was classified under a general category of large cell carcinoma, however as pathologists studied this entity in detail, it was evident that LCNEC has a distinct clinicopathological identity. Histopathologically, these tumors are characterized by high mitotic rate (more than 10 mitosis per high power field), extensive necrosis, and neuroendocrine features, specifically the presence of chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin.\n\nLCNEC is a rare and aggressive disease with a paucity of data regarding disease progression. Precise incidence and prevalence is unknown. From 2003-2012, the Dutch Cancer Registry reported 952 histologically confirmed new cases of pulmonary LCNECs. Among these cases, 383 patients presented with advanced disease, primarily metastases to liver, bone, or brain. The prognosis is poor with overall 5-year survival for metastatic disease less than 5%, which is similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although some studies suggest that the prognosis for early-stage LCNEC might be slightly better and similar to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nMolecular profiling of small-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas is well established and validated, indicating universally expressed co-mutation for TP53 and RB1. Recently there have been attempts to define genomic profiles of LCNEC. The development of a 241-gene panel on pulmonary tumors, next-generation sequencing allows LCNECs to be further defined.\n\nBased on specific genetic signatures, Rekhtman and colleagues sub-classified 45 LCNECs into two major cohorts: 1) small cell-like (TP53/RB1 co-mutated; n=18) and 2) non-small cell-like (n=25), as well as one minor cohort (carcinoid-like n=2).\n\nSimilarly, molecular profiling of gastrointestinal high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (GI-NECs) indicate that they can also be dichotomously categorized by the presence or absence of co-mutations for TP53 and RB1.\n\nTreatment regimens for small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma are well established, based on clinical trials conducted in SCLC. In contrast, current guidelines regarding optimal treatment for large-cell and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas are nonexistent, driven by the paucity of data on these rare and highly fatal tumors. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently defined a new subtype of high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, mixed neuroendocrine neoplasm (MINEN), which features characteristics found in large-cell carcinomas and in other tumor types, including adenocarcinomas for example.\n\nTo date, there are no prospective randomized clinical trials examining front line therapies for metastatic HG-NECs, based on mutational profiles. This study will utilize recent genomic profiles of high-grade large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas to guide and inform clinicians of optimal treatments.",

      "brief_summary": "This randomized phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without cediranib works in treating patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing. Cediranib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving olaparib and cediranib may help treat patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.",

Hormone therapy such as antiandrogen therapy may fight prostate cancer by blocking the production and interfering with the action of hormones. Abiraterone acetate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Neutron radiation therapy uses high energy neutrons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. It is not yet known whether antiandrogen therapy, abiraterone acetate, and prednisone with or without neutron radiation therapy may work better in treating patients with prostate cancer.",

      "detailed_description": "The study schedule for each patient consists of the screening period (up to 2 weeks) followed by the treatment period (4 treatment administrations at 8-week interval), and the follow-up period (10 years).\n\nThe treatment period will consist of 4 Lutathera treatments administered at 8-week intervals. Lutathera administration will occur on Week 1 Day 1 of each cycle. Each patient will receive a total of 4 doses of Lutathera (7.4 GBq/200 mCi x 4 administrations every 8 weeks; cumulative dose: 29.6 GBq/800 mCi). An infusion of 2.5% Lysine - Arginine amino acid (AA) solution will be co-administered with each Lutathera dose for renal protection according to the approved Lutathera local prescribing information. An antiemetic will be administered prior to infusion of the AA solution for prevention of infusion-related nausea and vomiting.\n\nThe dosimetry and PK assessments will be performed during the first week after the 1st Lutathera dose, i.e. one time during the study treatment period for each patient. The dosimetry analysis will allow for estimation from the 1st Lutathera administration of the cumulative absorbed radiation dose from 4 Lutathera doses and also for taking a decision on the next dose levels. In the exceptional circumstances when dosimetry cannot be performed in a particular patient after the first Lutathera dose, it should be completed as soon as feasible upon a later dose. In order to minimize risk for each study subject, an accelerated analysis of dosimetry and safety data will be performed for each patient in the study, to enable the Investigator to take a decision for the subsequent Lutathera doses. The results of dosimetry assessments (imaging and blood dosimetry) will be provided to the investigators for their evaluation prior to administration of subsequent therapeutic cycles in each patient.\n\nA total follow-up period of 10 years (120 months) after the last Lutathera dose will take place for each patient who received at least one dose of Lutathera. This follow-up period will be comprised of a short-term follow-up of 6 months to evaluate cumulative Lutathera toxicities, followed by a long-term follow up of another 114 months.\n\nAn external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will also operate in the study to evaluate accumulating safety and dosimetry data, to ensure the safety of adolescents enrolled in the study, and to provide recommendations to investigators as well as to the clinical team in charge of conducting the study.",

      "detailed_description": "Preclinical data suggest that concomitant inhibition of two non-redundant amplified pathways (mTOR and EGFR) can reverse drug resistance and more profoundly affect tumor growth than targeting either pathway alone. EGFR inhibitors may abrogate feedback loops that stimulate upstream signaling events such as PI3K and Akt in the face of mTOR inhibition. Although ErbB receptors signal through mTOR-dependent mechanisms, mTOR-independent ErbB receptor signaling also occurs in cancer. Furthermore, deregulation of apoptotic pathways like the PI3K/Akt/PTEN axis (e.g. via PTEN loss of function or AKT gene amplification) may lead to resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Treatment with an inhibitor of mTOR may reverse this resistance. Targeting the mTOR and EGFR pathways concurrently may more effectively inhibit tumor growth than inhibiting either pathway alone.\n\nThe compelling preclinical data, coupled with modest single agent activity seen with EGFR inhibition and mTOR inhibition in neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), provides a strong rationale for studying the activity of concomitant pathway inhibition in patients with advanced NETs. Support for this strategy also stems from the fact that EGFR inhibitors can be safety combined with mTOR inhibitors in humans. Emerging data from a phase I study of RAD001 plus erlotinib in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) suggests that the two agents can be safely combined at the following doses: RAD001 5 mg PO q D and erlotinib 150 mg PO qD.\n\nOf note, the original dose selections for RAD001 and erlotinib for this study stem directly from phase I studies with this combination (RAD001 5 mg PO qD plus erlotinib 150 mg PO qD). The modified dose selections (RAD001 5 mg PO qD plus erlotinib 100 mg PO qD) are the result of integrating discussions with the study sponsor, preliminary safety data from the first few patients enrolled in this study (suggesting that some patients tolerate full-dose therapy and others do not) and additional phase I data suggesting that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in some patient populations is lower than in others, e.g. the MTD in breast cancer patients is RAD001 2.5 mg PO qD and erlotinib 100 mg PO QD (Mayer et al. American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2009 Breast Cancer Symposium, Abstract #254).",

      "detailed_description": "Subjects with progressive, non-functional advanced or metastatic thoracic, GI or pancreatic well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET) have few treatment options. The only FDA approved treatment regimen offers little response potential. In currently unpublished data with inhibitory immune checkpoint agents, patients with NET have shown promising clinical benefit. This therapy offers a novel approach to potentially provide long term benefit, but must be further explored. The safety profile of nivolumab plus ipilimumab is characterized by immune-related toxicities, such as diarrhea, rash, pneumonitis, liver toxicity, and endocrinopathies (Nivolumab, Ipilimumab Investigator's Brochures). The frequencies and intensities of these events in the combination are variable and depend on the specific doses and schedule used. In the dosing schedules selected, these events were mostly low grade and manageable with the use of corticosteroids. Nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy has shown improved efficacy over either agent alone in melanoma. Rationale for Single Arm Design This study will use a single arm open-label design.

      "brief_summary": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer. \"Investigational\" means that the drug, Ziv-aflibercept, is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not yet approved Ziv-aflibercept for use in patients with your type of cancer.\n\nEvery person has molecules in their bloodstream called vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). These molecules help grow and sustain new blood vessels needed by the human body. Cancer tumors hijack this mechanism because they need new blod vessels and oxygen to grow. Ziv-aflibercept is an antibody. Antibodies are proteins that are produced naturally in our bodies and help to recognize foreign substances in our body. Ziv-aflibercept is a \"targeted therapy\" called a \"VEGF Trap\", that \"traps\" (binds) these VEGFs and prevents the cancer from using them to grow.\n\nThough Ziv-aflibercept has not yet been FDA approved for the treatment of carcinoid tumors, it has recently been approved for patients with treatment-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\nIn this research study, we will use Ziv-aflibercept in combination with standard octreotide therapy to see if it slows the growth or spread of your carcinoid tumor. Standard octreotide (sandostatin) therapy is currently approved for treating symptoms of carcinoid tumors, such as those caused by carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by hormones and other substances released by carcinoid tumors into the bloodstream. One of these secreted substances is serotonin, one of the body's natural chemical messengers. When excess serotonin secreted by the carcinoid tumors reaches the body's tissues, it is thought to cause diarrhea and redness (flushing) of the face, chest or back. Excess serotonin may also cause changes in the structure of the heart valves, which can impair the heart's function. Octreotide works by binding to receptors found on carcinoid tumors and prevents the release of hormones from the tumor.",
      "detailed_description": "If you are willing to participate in this study you will be asked to undergo some screening tests and procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures include: a medical history, physical examination, CT or MRI, blood tests, serum chromogranin A, urine tests, 24-hour urine collection, pregnancy test and an electrocardiogram. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study.\n\nIf you meet the requirements for this study and you agree to continue your participation, you will receive Ziv-aflibercept every two weeks. Each dose of Ziv-aflibercept consists of an approximately 60 minutes infusion (through a needle into a vein). You will also receive an injection of Octreotide LAR (long acting release) monthly as part of your treatment for carcinoid tumor. This injection will be given to you by a nurse in your buttock. You may already be on Octreotide LAR. In that case, you will continue taking it at the same dose and schedule.\n\nYou will need to come to the clinic every two weeks while participating in this study. Each cycle is 28 days.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be performed on Days 1 and 15 of each cycle: questions about your health, physical exam (Day 1 of each cycle only), vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test (Day 1 of each cycle only).\n\nUrine tests will be performed every other cycle.\n\nThe following tests and procedures will be done at the end of every third cycle: CT scan or MRI, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.\n\nAfter the final dose of the study drug the following tests and procedures will be performed: questions about your general health, physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, pregnancy test, EKG, Serum Chromogranin A, 24-hour urine collection.",

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as topotecan hydrochloride, work by damaging the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in tumor cells, causing those cells to die and the tumor to shrink. However, some tumor cells can become less affected by chemotherapy because they have ways to repair the damaged DNA.

For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load\n* The effects of M6620 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and because DNA-damage response (DDR) inhibitors as well as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and for 6 months after completion of M6620 administration\n* Patients with treated brain metastases are eligible if they are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days\n* Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen are eligible for this trial\n* Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\n* Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis are not eligible due to their extremely poor prognosis and since it is unclear whether the investigational agent penetrates the blood-brain barrier. However, subjects who have had treatment for their brain metastasis and are symptomatically stable while off steroid therapy for a minimum of 21 days may be enrolled\n* Patients who have received prior topotecan therapy\n* Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n  * Note: Patients who have had palliative radiotherapy may be included as long as they have recovered from any radiotherapy related adverse events (allow at least a week between radiotherapy completion and study treatment)\n* Patients who have not recovered from adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy except hair loss and peripheral neuropathy (i.e., have residual toxicities \\> grade 1)\n* Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents\n* History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to M6620 or topotecan used in study\n* M6620 is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4); therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) should be avoided. Patients requiring any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A during the course of the study are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or of which to minimize use. The Patient Drug Interactions Handout and Wallet Card should be provided to patients. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product\n* Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness\n* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because M6620 as a DDR inhibitor may have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with M6620, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with M6620. These potential risks may also apply to topotecan used in this study\n* Patients with high grade neuroendocrine cancers, but with no small cell morphology will not be eligible\n* Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements\n* Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome will not be eligible",

      "brief_summary": "This phase II trial studies ziv-aflibercept in treating and perfusion computed tomography perfusion imaging in predicting response in patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors that have spread to other parts of the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Ziv-aflibercept may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Diagnostic procedures, such as computed tomography perfusion, imaging may help measure a patient's response to ziv-aflibercept treatment.",
      "detailed_description": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate the objective response rate (RR) of ziv-aflibercept among patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET)s according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\n\nII. Test the following hypotheses: that baseline perfusion computed tomography (CT) parameters can predict which patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) will respond to treatment with ziv-aflibercept.\n\nSECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Estimate progression free survival (PFS) duration among patients treated with ziv-aflibercept.\n\nII. Evaluate the relationship between response rate and baseline blood volume (BV) and between response rate and baseline permeability surface (PS).\n\nTERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\nI. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BV expressed as relative change from baseline correlate with response to ziv-aflibercept.\n\nII. Determine whether post-treatment tumor blood flow (BF) (absolute measurement) correlates with response to ziv-aflibercept.\n\nIII. Determine whether post-treatment changes in BF and, BV, expressed as relative change from baseline, correlate with relative change in sum of tumor diameters (RECIST 1.1 measurements).\n\nIV. Determine the effect of ziv-aflibercept therapy on post-treatment blood flow (BF), BV, mean transit time (MTT), and PS at 4 weeks after treatment.\n\nV. Evaluate the changes in tumor perfusion parameters at time of progression.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive ziv-aflibercept intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo computed tomography perfusion imaging at baseline, day 21 of course 1, and at time of progression.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.",

Potassium testing on the infusion day was performed at 0h (before the infusion), and at 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 12h, and 24h after the start of infusion. Vital signs and ECGs were taken as specified in the assessment schedule. All patients were monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hyperkalemia, e.g. dyspnoea, weakness, numbness, chest pain and cardiac manifestations (conduction abnormalities and cardiac arrhythmias). Other common adverse reactions during arginine/lysine solution administration are nausea and vomiting. Before the start of arginine/lysine solution infusion, an intravenous bolus of an anti-emetic was given. The choice of anti-emetic drugs was at the discretion of the physician.\n\nFollow-up Phase:\n\nAll patients were called for a safety follow-up in 48 hours after dosing.

In patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), due to their heterogeneity and longer survival, it is expected that the prevalence of malnutrition is probably underdiagnosed, as well as the existence of a negative impact on different parameters (quality of life, survival). So far, the studies carried out on nutrition and NET are very scarce and none has been carried out so far in Spain.\n\nBefore being able to carry out nutritional intervention studies on these patients, it is necessary to know the reality of the nutritional status of patients with NETs in Spain. The main motivation for the NUTRIGETNE study is to evaluate the epidemiological status of nutrition in NETs in the spanish population. In addition to know the epidemiological picture, it is intended to study the nutritional status from different points of view: analytical, clinical, anthropometric, etc. Besides, the study of nutritional status will allow us to closely monitor the patients who have a higher risk of malnutrition and to propose early interventions for those, as well as the impact of their nutritional status on different parameters: survival, hospitalization, quality of life or responses to the treatments.\n\nNUTRIGETNE is a cross-sectional, open and multicenter study in which the nutritional status of patients with GEP NET in Spain will be evaluated.",

Rapamycin and similar types of drugs have been used in many other tumors, including advanced renal cell carcinoma. A standard mTOR inhibitor used in neuroendocrine tumors is everolimus. The human albumin component of ABI-009 may allow rapamycin to reach cancer cells more effectively.\n\nABI-009 has not been approved for the treatment of advanced, malignant neuroendocrine tumors of the lung, gastrointestinal tract and/or pancreas.

They may have a tumor biopsy.\n\nParticipants will have a physical exam. They will have a review of their symptoms, their medicines, and their ability to do their normal activities. They will have blood tests. They will have an electrocardiogram to evaluate their heart.\n\nParticipants will have a computed tomography (CT) scan, a series of x-rays taken of parts of the body.\n\nParticipants will get durvalumab on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle. It is given through a small plastic tube that is put in an arm vein. They will take olaparib by mouth twice every day.

      "detailed_description": "Background:\n\nTargeted therapies designed for specific genetic alterations, known as cancer driver mutations, have changed the treatment paradigm in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective in NSCLC with activating mutation in the EGFR. Although most patients achieve robust responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with tumor shrinkage and symptomatic relief, drug resistance eventually develops in the majority of patients.\n\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation has been reported as one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs.\n\nSeveral phase III trials showed durable response with poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the breast and ovarian cancer with breast cancer gene (BRCA) mutation, a tumor suppressor gene involving homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway, and several PARP inhibitors are now Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for these cancers.\n\nImmune checkpoint blockade appears to be most effective against hypermutated tumors, suggesting that clinical responses correlate with an increased propensity to produce neoantigens.\n\nEGFR-mutated transformed SCLC is an aggressive cancer whose clinical course is similar to that of SCLC. There are no standard treatments for this disease and prospective studies have not been conducted to date. Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone are not effective for EGFR-mutated transformed SCLC. Analyses of EGFR transformed SCLC tumors suggest that these tumors are HRR deficient.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo assess the efficacy of a combination of durvalumab and olaparib with respect to best overall response (BOR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria (RECIST 1.1) in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) that transform to SCLC and other neuroendocrine carcinomas.\n\nEligibility:\n\nSubjects with initial diagnosis of EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and histologically or cytologically confirmed transformation to small cell/neuroendocrine tumors following treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\nSubjects should have received platinum-based chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy for small cell/neuroendocrine transformation or refused such therapy.\n\nAge \\>=18 years.\n\nSubjects must have measurable disease.\n\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \\<= 2\n\nAdequate organ function\n\nDesign:\n\n-This is an open label Phase II study evaluating the combination of durvalumab and olaparib\n\nin participants with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung carcinoma and histologically or cytologically confirmed transformation to small cell/neuroendocrine tumors following treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\nPatients will be treated with durvalumab (1,500 mg), intravenous (IV), every 28 days and olaparib (300 mg twice a day (BID) for total daily dose of 600 mg) in a 28-day cycles.\n\nPatients will be evaluated for toxicity every 4 weeks by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0, and for response every 8 (+/-1) weeks by RECIST 1.1\n\nTreatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.",
